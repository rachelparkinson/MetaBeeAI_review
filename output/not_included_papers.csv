A New Approach for Detecting Sublethal Effects of Neonicotinoids on Bumblebees Using Optical Sensor Technology,322,JOUR,"['Chatzaki, V', 'Montoro, M', 'El-Rashid, R', 'Jensen, AB', 'Lecocq, A']",INSECTS,"Among insects, bees are important pollinators, providing many vital ecosystem services. The recent pollinator decline is threatening both their diversity and abundance. One of the main drivers of this decline is the extensive use of pesticides. Neonicotinoids, one of the most popular groups of pesticides, can be toxic to bees. In fact, numerous studies have found that neonicotinoids can cause sublethal effects, which can impair the biology, physiology, and colony survival of the bees. Yet, there are still knowledge gaps, and more research is needed to better understand the interaction between neonicotinoids and bees, especially in the field. A new optical sensor, which can automatically identify flying insects using machine learning, has been created to continuously monitor insect activity in the field. This study investigated the potential use of this sensor as a tool for monitoring the sublethal effects of pesticides on bumblebees. Bombus terrestris workers were orally exposed to field-realistic doses of imidacloprid. Two types of exposures were tested: acute and chronic. The flight activity of pesticide-exposed and non-exposed bumblebees was recorded, and the events of the insect flights recorded by the sensor were used in two ways: to extract the values of the wingbeat frequency and to train machine learning models. The results showed that the trained model was able to recognize differences between the events created by pesticide-exposed bumblebees and the control bumblebees. This study demonstrates the possibility of the optical sensor for use as a tool to monitor bees that have been exposed to sublethal doses of pesticides. The optical sensor can provide data that could be helpful in managing and, ideally, mitigating the decline of pollinators from one of their most major threats, pesticides.",2023,10.3390/insects14080713,14,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0
A pragmatic approach to assess the exposure of the honey bee (apis mellifera) when subjected to pesticide spray,39,JOUR,"['Poquet, Y.', 'Bodin, L.', 'Tchamitchian, M.', 'Fusellier, M.', 'Giroud, B.', 'Lafay, F.', 'Buleté, A.', 'Tchamitchian, S.', 'Cousin, M.', 'Pélissier, M.', 'Brunet, J.-L.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",PLoS ONE,"Plant protection spray treatments may expose non-target organisms to pesticides. In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure. This new approach to measure risk is more accurate and could become a tool to aid the decision-making process in the risk assessment of pesticides. © 2014 Poquet et al.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113728,9,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,
A real-time imaging system for multiple honey bee tracking and activity monitoring,90,JOUR,"['Ngo, T.N.', 'Wu, K.-C.', 'Yang, E.-C.', 'Lin, T.-T.']",Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,"This study presents a real-time imaging system for monitoring honey bee activity by counting the honey bees entering and exiting the beehive. Images are continuously acquired at the beehive entrance, and the honey bees in the images are segmented and detected using the background subtraction method. Tracking of honey bees is achieved using an integrated Kalman Filter and Hungarian algorithm tracking method. The tracking algorithm was used to determine the incoming and outgoing activity of individual honey bees with an automatic counting accuracy of 93.9 ± 1.1% in comparison with manual counting. The in-and-out activity and environmental information from sensors were transmitted to a remote server via a 4G LTE router for later analyses. To evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the system, the imaging systems were installed in multiple beehives, and designed experiments were carried out. The experiments involved long-term monitoring to assess the pesticide effects on honey bee behaviors by treating the beehives with different concentrations of imidacloprid pesticides. Using the in-and-out activities information collected, indices were further derived and analyzed. The information obtained from the experiments was used to assess the health conditions of the honey bee colonies monitored. Different measurement results such as hourly and daily frequencies of honey bees’ in-and-out activity under different conditions were presented. The developed imaging system is cost effective and can be used as a useful tool for long-term monitoring of the health and activity of honey bee colonies and to further analyze behavior traits of honey bees. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,10.1016/j.compag.2019.05.050,163,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

Alterations in honey bee gut microorganisms caused by Nosema spp. and pest control methods,784,JOUR,"['Diaz, T.', 'del-Val, E.', 'Ayala, R.', 'Larsen, J.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Honey bees are associated with gut microorganisms essential for their nutrition and health. The composition of the microbial community can be used as a biological health indicator and is characterized using biomarker fatty acids. Commonly, gut microorganisms are exposed to pathogens and to an array of chemical and biological pest control methods. RESULTS: We found a strong negative effect on microbial gut community composition when exposed to the bee pest control chemicals oxytetracycline, oxalic acid and imidacloprid, and when inoculated with the bee pest Nosema spp. and the potential bee pest biocontrol agent Lactobacillus plantarum. Results from the in vitro test with bee pest chemicals showed a differential response of Lactobacillus spp. At the community level, some taxonomic groups were more affected depending on treatment, but sharp changes in the microbial structure were caused by compounds generally considered as bee safe. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pests such as Nosema spp. and pest control methods alter the composition of bee gut microorganisms, which may have severe consequences for pathogen defense, physiology and general honey bee health. In addition, L. plantarum has potential as a biocontrol agent against Nosema spp. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",2019,10.1002/ps.5188,75,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,
An ecological risk assessment for spinosad use on cotton,163,JOUR,"['Cleveland, C.B.', 'Mayes, M.A.', 'Cryer, S.A.']",Pest Management Science,"Spinosad is a reduced-risk insecticide with a novel mode of action that provides an alternative to older classes of insecticides such as organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. A comprehensive ecological risk assessment for spinosad use in US cotton crops is presented within a framework of tiered levels of refinement following the guidelines of the US EPA for ecological risk assessments. Toxicity information for a variety of species is documented and utilized, environmental concentrations estimated, and risk characterizations in the form of risk quotients are quantified. Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict offsite transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species. Spinosad is acutely toxic to bees under laboratory conditions, but toxicity of residue studies and field studies indicate that under actual use conditions the impact on bees is minimal. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.",2002,10.1002/ps.424,58,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,
An insecticide application scheme in cotton fields with bi-directional selective effects on bees and pests,394,JOUR,"['Du, M.', 'Li, M.', 'Li, X.', 'Yang, H.', 'Li, Y.']",International Journal of Tropical Insect Science,"In this paper, molecular dynamics, full factorial experimental design and molecular docking were used to determine the toxic effects of pesticides on pests (Tetranychus telarius, Lygus lucorum and Helicoverpa armigera) and bees (North Chinese bee) in a cotton field, and an insecticide collocation scheme with the bi-directional selectivity was devised. Firstly, the main insecticides for three stages of cotton growth were identified under the lateral mixing condition. Insecticides for the first phase included abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b), acetamiprid (N-(N-cyano-ethylimine)-N-methyl-2-chloropyridine-5-methylamine), dicofol (1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol) and cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester); the insecticides available in the second phase included cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), phoxim (O,O-diethyl-O-α-cyanophenylbenzylamine thiophosphate ester), deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester)-cyano-diphenyl ether) and abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b). In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicity by 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%. Finally, by calculating the resultant force from different types of non-bonded forces, the mechanism of the effect of the optimal application scheme on bees and pests under two scenarios was analyzed. The optimally combined scheme prepared by screening could provide the bi-directional selectivity to bees and pests.

Analysis and evaluation of (neuro)peptides in honey bees exposed to pesticides in field conditions,852,JOUR,"['Gómez-Ramos, M.D.M.', 'Gómez Ramos, M.J.', 'Martínez Galera, M.', 'Gil García, M.D.', 'Fernández-Alba, A.R.']",Environmental Pollution,"During the last years, declines in honey bee colonies are being registered worldwide. Cholinergic pesticides and their extensive use have been correlated to the decline of pollinators and there is evidence that pesticides act as neuroendocrine disruptors affecting the metabolism of neuropeptides. However, there is a big absence of studies with quantitative results correlating the effect of pesticide exposure with changes on neuropeptides insects, and most of them are conducted under laboratory conditions, typically with individual active ingredients. In this study, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate pesticide effects on honey bees through the analysis of (neuro)peptides. The workflow consists of a rapid extraction method and liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole for preselected neuropeptides. For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≥ 500 μg kg−1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≤ 20 μg kg−1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins. It has been shown a correlation between pesticide exposure and a decrease of some neuropeptides and other head peptides in honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.091,235,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,
Application of predefined doses of neonicotinoid containing dusts in field trials and acute effects on honey bees,931,JOUR,"['Pistorius, J.', 'Wehner, A.', 'Kriszan, M.', 'Bargen, H.', 'Knäbe, S.', 'Klein, O.', 'Frommberger, M.', 'Stähler, M.', 'Heimbach, U.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"This study explored the effects of insecticidal dusts on honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) after exposure to a priori defined dose under field conditions. For this purpose two different rates of abraded seed dust, containing active substance Clothianidin, were applied on flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham during bee-flight with a purpose-built dust applicator. We observed dose-related high acute effects on bee mortality at both application rates, 0.25 and 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin in dust per ha, resulting in up to 4.3 and 17 fold higher mortality compared to pre-application level and an overall increase of mortality during the 7 days exposure period of 2.0 and 9.8 fold. In dead bees, residues detected between both rates appliedwere up to 2.6 fold higher in the 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin dust exposure scenario. On day 7, residues up to 28 μg Clothianidin/kg were detected in bee bread of stored Phacelia pollen. The findings of high effects at chosen rates highlight the need to include specific dust drift field trials for seed treatment products with highly toxic insecticides in risk assessment used in crops with potential dust abrasion and emission from seeds. Further work is required to determine appropriate application rates in further semi-field and field testing that reflect field realistic drift exposure levels. © 2015, Universita degli Studi di Bologna, Department of Agroenvironmental Sciences and Technologies.

Are honeybees suitable surrogates for use in pesticide risk assessment for non-Apis bees?,1034,JOUR,"['Thompson, HM', 'Pamminger, T']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Historically, bee regulatory risk assessment for pesticides has centred on the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), primarily due to its availability and adaptability to laboratory conditions. Recently, there have been efforts to develop a battery of laboratory toxicity tests for a range of non-Apis bee species to directly assess the risk to them. However, it is not clear whether the substantial investment associated with the development and implementation of such routine screening will actually improve the level of protection of non-Apis bees. We argue, using published acute toxicity data from a range of bee species and standard regulatory exposure scenarios, that current first-tier honeybee acute risk assessment schemes utilised by regulatory authorities are protective of other bee species and further tests should be conducted only in cases of concern. We propose similar analysis of alternative exposure scenarios (chronic and developmental) once reliable data for non-Apis bees are available to expand our approach to these scenarios. In addition, we propose that in silico (simulation) approaches can then be used to address population-level effects in more field-realistic scenarios. Such an approach could lead to a protective, but also workable, risk assessment for non-Apis species while contributing to pollination security in agricultural landscapes around the globe.

"Assessment of lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, ethion, and glyphosate on aversive conditioning, motility, and lifespan in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)",706,JOUR,"['Delkash-Roudsari, S.', 'Chicas-Mosier, A.M.', 'Goldansaz, S.H.', 'Talebi-Jahromi, K.', 'Ashouri, A.', 'Abramson, C.I.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) play an important role in agriculture worldwide. Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL−1), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL−1) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL−1) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, RoundUp®, was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; RoundUp® showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111108,204,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

To assess risk in acute and chronic exposure scenarios in Cucurbita and field crops, concentrations of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids) and chlorantraniliprole (anthranilic diamide) in cropped soil were plotted to produce an environmental exposure distribution for each insecticide. The probability of exceedance of several exposure endpoints (LC50s) was compared to an acceptable risk threshold (5%). In Cucurbita crops, under acute exposure, risk to hoary squash bees was below 5% for honey bee LC50s for all residues evaluated but exceeded 5% for clothianidin and imidacloprid using a solitary bee LC50. For Cucurbita crops in the chronic exposure scenario, exposure risks for clothianidin and imidacloprid exceeded 5% for all endpoints, and exposure risk for chlorantraniliprole was below 5% for all endpoints. In field crops, risk to ground-nesting bees was high from clothianidin in all exposure scenarios and high for thiamethoxam and imidacloprid under chronic exposure scenarios.

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. © 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

Bee Pollinator Mortality Due to Pesticide-Laden Particulate Matter from Beef Cattle Feedyards,342,JOUR,"['Green, F.B.', 'Peterson, E.M.', 'Emert, A.D.', 'Subbiah, S.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"Wild and managed bees are critical for the stability of trophic webs, angiosperm reproduction, and agricultural productivity. Unfortunately, as many as 40% of crop pollinators are in a steep decline due to habitat loss and exposure to agrochemicals. Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40). Concurrent, colocated total suspended particulate matter samples contained multiple insecticides and parasiticides including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones, in significantly higher concentrations downwind of feedyards (bifenthrin, 8.45 ± 4.92; permethrin, 1032.34 ± 740.76; clothianidin, 3.61 ± 1.48; imidacloprid, 73.32 ± 47.52; thiamethoxam, 5.81 ± 3.16; abamectin, 0.45 ± 0.29; ivermectin, 8.88 ± 5.06 ng/g).

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybees’ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
Biopesticide-induced behavioral and morphological alterations in the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata,104,JOUR,"['Barbosa, WF', 'Tomé, HVV', 'Bernardes, RC', 'Siqueira, MAL', 'Smagghe, G', 'Guedes, RNC']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Because of their natural origin, biopesticides are assumed to be less harmful to beneficial insects, including bees, and therefore their use has been widely encouraged for crop protection. There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions.

Most often detected pesticides were prosulfocarb (36.4% of foragers) and flutolanil (15.9%), both never documented in bumblebees before. The pesticide load was significantly different between land-uses in spring. The study highlights the importance of considering pesticide mixtures under field conditions for toxicity studies and risk assessment.

Chronic exposure to a field-realistic concentration of Closer® SC (24% sulfoxaflor) insecticide impacted the growth and foraging activity of honey bee colonies,568,JOUR,"['El-Din, H.S.', 'Helmy, W.S.', 'Al Naggar, Y.', 'Ahmed, F.S.']",Apidologie,"The effects of sulfoxaflor on various pollinators have long been debated. However, there have been few in-hive studies on sulfoximines, and the effects on honey bee colony growth and foraging activity are unknown. Here, we calculated the LC50 of Closer® 24% suspension concentrate (SC) using honey bee foragers then assessed the impacts of chronic exposure of honey bees to a lesser concentration of Closer® in a semi-field in-hive experiment. To do that, we used a worst-case exposure scenario and fed bees for 21 days with a sublethal and field-relevant concentration of sulfoxaflor (0.3 ppb) which represents the calculated LC5 value of Closer®. A total of six colonies was assigned to the pesticide or control treatment. Then, we evaluated the colony development and activity as well as the weight and foraging activity of individual foraging bees. We also revealed that sublethal Closer® exposure impacted honey bee colony growth and activity by reducing bee bread, honey, and brood production, as well as weight and foraging performance of individual bees when colonies were kept under field conditions. Given the findings of this study, as well as comparable findings reported on spray application of Closer® using standard application practices in semi-field conditions, sulfoxaflor’s potential harm to pollinators at realistic levels merits additional investigation particularly in combination with other stressors to better understand how novel insecticides influence pollinators and pollination services. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00937-2,53,,0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,
Chronic oral toxicity protocol for adult solitary bees (Osmia bicornis L.): Reduced survival under long-term exposure to a “bee-safe” insecticide,89,JOUR,"Azpiazu, C.; Sgolastra, F.; Ippolito, A.; Albacete, S.; Brandt, A.; Colli, M.; Grossar, D.; Jeker, L.; Malagnini, V.; Sancho, G.; Splitt, A.; Straub, L.; Strobl, V.; Boranski, M.; Jachuła, J.; Martins, C.; Medrzycki, P.; Simon-Delso, N.; Tosi, S.; Bosch, J.",Environmental Pollution,"Pollinators are essential for crop productivity. Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ≤ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ≤10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Clearance of ingested neonicotinoid pesticide (imidacloprid) in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),940,JOUR,"['Cresswell, J.E.', 'Robert, F.-X.L.', 'Florance, H.', 'Smirnoff, N.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Bees in agricultural landscapes are exposed to dietary pesticides such as imidacloprid when they feed from treated mass-flowering crops. Concern about the consequent impact on bees makes it important to understand their resilience. In the laboratory, the authors therefore fed adult worker bees on dosed syrup (125 μg L-1 of imidacloprid, or 98 μg kg-1) either continuously or as a pulsed exposure and measured their behaviour (feeding and locomotory activity) and whole-body residues. RESULTS: On dosed syrup, honey bees maintained much lower bodily levels of imidacloprid than bumblebees (<0.2 ng versus 2.4 ng of imidacloprid per bee). Dietary imidacloprid did not affect the behaviour of honey bees, but it reduced feeding and locomotory activity in bumblebees. After the pulsed exposure, bumblebees cleared bodily imidacloprid after 48 h and recovered behaviourally. CONCLUSION: The differential behavioural resilience of the two species can be attributed to the observed differential in bodily residues. The ability of bumblebees to recover may be environmentally relevant in wild populations that face transitory exposures from the pulsed blooming of mass-flowering crops. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.",2014,10.1002/ps.3569,70,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,
"Combined nutritional stress and a new systemic pesticide (flupyradifurone, Sivanto®) reduce bee survival, food consumption, flight success, and thermoregulation",750,JOUR,"['Tong, L.', 'Nieh, J.C.', 'Tosi, S.']",Chemosphere,"Flupyradifurone (FPF, Sivanto®) is a new butenolide insecticide that, like the neonicotinoids, is a systemic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. However, FPF is considered bee-safe (according to standard Risk Assessment tests), and is thus a potential solution to the adverse effects of other pesticides on beneficial insects. To date, no studies have examined the impact of nutritional stress (decreased food diversity and quality) and FPF exposure on bee health although both stressors can occur, especially around agricultural monocultures. We therefore tested the effects of a field-realistic FPF concentration (4 ppm, FPFdaily dose = 241 ± 4 ng/bee/day, 1/12 of LD50) and nutritional stress (nectar with low-sugar concentrations) on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mortality, food consumption, thermoregulation, flight success (unsuccessful vs. successful), and flight ability (duration, distance, velocity). Flight and thermoregulation are critical to colony health: bees fly to collect food and reproduce, and they thermoregulate to increase flight efficiency and to rear brood. We studied the effects across seasons because seasonality can influence bee sensitivity to environmental stress. We demonstrate that, depending upon season and nutritional stress, FPF can reduce bee survival (−14%), food consumption (−14%), thermoregulation (−4%, i.e. hypothermia), flight success (−19%), and increase flight velocity (+13%). Because pesticide exposure and nutritional stress can co-occur, we suggest that future studies and pesticide risk assessments consider both seasonality and nutritional stress when evaluating pesticide safety for bees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124408,237,,0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,
Comparing Sensitivity of Different Bee Species to Pesticides: A TKTD modeling approach,382,JOUR,"['Baas, J.', 'Goussen, B.', 'Taenzler, V.', 'Roeben, V.', 'Miles, M.', 'Preuss, T.G.', 'van den Berg, S.', 'Roessink, I.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Risk assessment for bees is mainly based on data for honey bees; however, risk assessment is intended to protect all bee species. This raises the question of whether data for honey bees are a good proxy for other bee species. This issue is not new and has resulted in several publications in which the sensitivity of bee species is compared based on the values of the 48-h median lethal dose (LD50) from acute test results. When this approach is used, observed differences in sensitivity may result both from differences in kinetics and from inherent differences in species sensitivity. In addition, the physiology of the bee, like its overall size, the size of the honey stomach (for acute oral tests), and the physical appearance (for acute contact tests) also influences the sensitivity of the bee. The recently introduced Toxicokinetic–Toxicodynamic (TKTD) model that was developed for the interpretation of honey bee tests (Bee General Uniform Threshold Model for Survival [BeeGUTS]) could integrate the results of acute oral tests, acute contact tests, and chronic tests within one consistent framework. We show that the BeeGUTS model can be calibrated and validated for other bee species and also that the honey bee is among the more sensitive bee species. In addition, we found that differences in sensitivity between species are smaller than previously published comparisons based on 48-h LD50 values. The time-dependency of the LD50 and the specifics of the bee physiology are the main causes of the wider variation found in the published literature.

Fruit yield and quality, as a function of bee pollination, were statistically equal between the two treatments, and equal to that of the untreated control. The standard treatment of imidacloprid gave significantly better control than azadirachtin of one pest (cucumber beetle) early in the season.

Comprehensive analysis of neonicotinoids in Chinese commercial honey and pollen: A corresponding health risk assessment for non-targeted organisms,265,JOUR,"['Zhang, J', 'Wang, YY', 'Wurjihu, S', 'Ruan, HN', 'Huang, Y', 'Guo, MY', 'Kong, DD', 'Luo, JY', 'Yang, MH']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Neonicotinoids are broad-spectrum and highly effective insecticides that work by affecting neural activity in insects. Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides that are absorbed by plants, transported, and accumulated in plant tissues, including nectar and pollen. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment of the level of neonicotinoid contamination and the associated health risks to non-targeted organisms in commercial honey and pollen produced in China. This study collected 160 batches of honey and 26 batches of pollen from different regions and plant sources in China, analyzed the residue patterns of neonicotinoid pesticides, and comprehensively evaluated the exposure risks to non-targeted organisms including bees (adults and larvae) and humans. Furthermore, this study addresses this imperative by establishing a high-throughput, rapid, and ultra-sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) based on broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies to detect and quantify neonicotinoids, with validation conducted using the LC-MS/MS method. The findings indicated that 59.4 % of honey samples contained at least one of eight neonicotinoids, and the ic-ELISA rapid detection and calculation method could detect all the samples containing neonicotinoids. Additionally, the dietary risk assessment for humans and honeybees indicates that the consumption of a specific quantity of honey may not pose a health risk to human due to neonicotinoid intake. However, the Risk Quotient values for imidacloprid to adult bees and bee larvae, as well as clothianidin to bee larvae, were determined to be 2.22, 5.03, and 1.01, respectively-each exceeding 1. This highlights the elevated risk of acute toxicity posed by imidacloprid and clothianidin residues to honey bees.

"Context-Dependent Effect of Dietary Phytochemicals on Honey Bees Exposed to a Pesticide, Thiamethoxam",627,JOUR,"['Seshadri, A.', 'Bernklau, E.']",Journal of Insect Science,"Honey bees continue to face challenges relating to the degradation of natural flowering habitats that limit their access to diverse floral resources. While it is known that nectar and pollen provide macronutrients, flowers also contain secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that impart benefits including increased longevity, improved gut microbiome abundance, and pathogen tolerance. Our study aims to understand the role of phytochemicals in pesticide tolerance when worker bees were fed with sublethal doses (1 ppb and 10 ppb) of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, in 20% (w/v) sugar solution supplemented with 25 ppm of phytochemicals - caffeine, kaempferol, gallic acid, or p-coumaric acid, previously shown to have beneficial impacts on bee health. The effect of phytochemical supplementation during pesticide exposure was context-dependent. With 1 ppb TMX, phytochemical supplementation increased longevity but at 10 ppb TMX, longevity was reduced suggesting a negative synergistic effect. Phytochemicals mixed with 1 ppb TMX increased mortality in bees of the forager-age group but with 10 ppb TMX, mortality of the inhive-age group increased, implying the possibility of accumulation effect in lower sublethal doses. Given that the phytochemical composition of pollen and nectar varies between plant species, we suggest that the negative impacts of agrochemicals on honey bees could vary based on the phytochemicals in pollen and nectar of that crop, and hence the effects may vary across crops. Analyzing the phytochemical composition for individual crops may be a necessary first step prior to determining the appropriate dosage of agrochemicals so that harm to bees Apis mellifera L. is minimized while crop pests are effectively controlled. © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2021,10.1093/jisesa/ieab053,21,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,
Crop Pollination Exposes Honey Bees to Pesticides Which Alters Their Susceptibility to the Gut Pathogen Nosema ceranae,970,JOUR,"['Pettis, J.S.', 'Lichtenberg, E.M.', 'Andree, M.', 'Stitzinger, J.', 'Rose, R.', 'vanEngelsdorp, D.']",PLoS ONE,"Recent declines in honey bee populations and increasing demand for insect-pollinated crops raise concerns about pollinator shortages. Pesticide exposure and pathogens may interact to have strong negative effects on managed honey bee colonies. Such findings are of great concern given the large numbers and high levels of pesticides found in honey bee colonies. Thus it is crucial to determine how field-relevant combinations and loads of pesticides affect bee health. We collected pollen from bee hives in seven major crops to determine 1) what types of pesticides bees are exposed to when rented for pollination of various crops and 2) how field-relevant pesticide blends affect bees' susceptibility to the gut parasite Nosema ceranae. Our samples represent pollen collected by foragers for use by the colony, and do not necessarily indicate foragers' roles as pollinators. In blueberry, cranberry, cucumber, pumpkin and watermelon bees collected pollen almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers during our sampling. Thus more attention must be paid to how honey bees are exposed to pesticides outside of the field in which they are placed. We detected 35 different pesticides in the sampled pollen, and found high fungicide loads. The insecticides esfenvalerate and phosmet were at a concentration higher than their median lethal dose in at least one pollen sample. While fungicides are typically seen as fairly safe for honey bees, we found an increased probability of Nosema infection in bees that consumed pollen with a higher fungicide load.

Digestion dynamics of acetamiprid during royal jelly formation and exposure risk assessment to honeybee larva based on processing factor,192,JOUR,"['Jiang, P.', 'Zhang, S.', 'Chai, Y.', 'He, Q.', 'Gao, Q.', 'Xiao, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Cao, H.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Previous studies to the exposure effects of acetamiprid on honeybees were based on the analysis of bee pollen and honey sacs from field trials or of beebread and honey in the hive, which overestimate or underestimate the risk of exposure to pesticide residues. It was believed that the processing factor (PF) is an important variable to determine the final pesticide residue during royal jelly formation and the actual risk to honeybee larva. Hence, a QuEChERS method to determine acetamiprid contents in honeybee samples was established in this study. Then, the PFs for acetamiprid in beebread fermentation, honey brewing, and royal jelly formation were determined to be 0.85, 0.76, and 0.16, respectively. The PF for royal jelly formation was 0.04 when acetamiprid was detected in beebread alone, and it was 0.12 when acetamiprid was only detected in honey. Finally, the predicted exposure concentration of acetamiprid in royal jelly was calculated to be 2.05 µg/kg using the PF without significant difference with the 90th percentile value (3.64 µg/kg) in the actual sample.

We found that extensive foragers (A. mellifera) experienced the highest pesticide risk-additive toxicity-weighted concentrations.

Pesticide risk correlated among bee species and between food sources and was greatest in A. mellifera-collected pollen-useful information for future postapproval pesticide monitoring. We provide foraging trait- and landscape-dependent information on the occurrence, concentration and identity of pesticides that bees encounter to estimate pesticide risk, which is necessary for more realistic risk assessment and essential information for tracking policy goals to reduce pesticide risk.

Effect of aerial spraying of thiacloprid on pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus alternatus) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) in pine forests,402,JOUR,"['Suh, D.Y.', 'Jung, J.-K.', 'Lee, S.K.', 'Seo, S.-T.']",Entomological Research,"Monochamus alternatus is a very important vector of the pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) which is the causal agent of pine wilt disease. To reduce population density of M. alternatus, thiacloprid has been sprayed by aircrafts on pine forests. Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not. Consequently, thiacloprid sprayed by aircraft may be an effective control agent for Monochamus beetle adults without negative effect on honey bees, but aerial application to prevent expansion of pine wilt disease should be reassessed. © 2020 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2021,10.1111/1748-5967.12482,51,,0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,

In another set of experiments, cages were established with about 200 bees each, and imidacloprid added to the syrup at 0, 5, 20, and 100 ppb. Imidacloprid in the syrup did not affect bee survivorship but it did reduce syrup consumption per bee, with bees fed 100 ppb imidacloprid syrup consuming on average 631 mg per bee over 28 days while average consumption among the other groups ranged from 853 to 914 mg. Cluster temperature was affected by imidacloprid treatment: bees fed 5 ppb imidacloprid syrup had higher cluster temperatures over the 1st 10 days, 4.17° C above incubator temperature, than either bees fed 100 ppb syrup or control (2.35 and 3.19° C, respectively). © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,10.1007/s13592-018-0585-z,49,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,
Effects of five insecticides on main pests and pollinators in alfalfa seed fields,280,JOUR,"['Yang, X.', 'Zhu, M.', 'Shi, J.', 'Zhang, R.', 'Zhao, Z.', 'Zhang, J.']",Journal of Plant Protection,"To identify pesticides with higher effectiveness and lower toxicity, the indoor virulence and field efficacy of five pesticides 1.5% pyrethrin, 0.3% azadirachtin, 4% abamectin·acetamiprid, 2.5% cyhalothrin, and 70% imidacloprid were assessed on the major pests of alfalfa seed fields, specifically Odontothrips loti and pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. The effects of these five insecticides on the abundance and diversity indices of major pollinators were also analyzed. The results showed that the toxicity of 0.3% azadirachtin was relatively high for O. loti and A. pisum with LC50 values of 1.093 mg/L and 2.864 mg/L, respectively. Both 70% imidacloprid and 4% abamectin·acetamiprid showed high efficacy against both O. loti and A. pisum, with the highest efficacy exceeding 85.00%. However these two pesticides posed a greater threat to pollinators, while 0.3% azadirachtin was less threatening to them. It was recommended to use 0.3% azadirachtin (diluted 1 000 times) for pest control in alfalfa during the flowering stage.Meanwhile, 70% imidacloprid (diluted 1 000 times) and 4% abamectin·acetamiprid (diluted 1 000 times) can be used alternatively during the non-flowering stage for pest control. © 2023 Editorial Board of Journal of Plant Protection.

Effects of imidacloprid metabolites on habituation in honeybees suggest the existence of two subtypes of nicotinic receptors differentially expressed during adult development,1021,JOUR,"['Guez, D.', 'Belzunces, L.P.', 'Maleszka, R.']",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,"Habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) is age-dependent. Very young bees (≤7 days old) require significantly less trials to abolish the response to multiple sucrose stimulations than older bees (≥8 days old). A nicotinic agonist, imidacloprid, modifies this behaviour by increasing the number of trials in ≤7-day-old bees and by decreasing it in older bees [Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 76 (2001) 183.]. Here we tested our hypothesis that this effect is associated with a differential expression of two subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). By testing the effects of six metabolites of imidacloprid, we show that two of them, olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, modify the number of trials needed to habituate the PER in a contrasting manner. Olefin increases the number of trials in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid decreases the number of trials, but only in 8-day-old individuals. We conclude that olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid are specific agonists of two subtypes of an nAChR that are differentially expressed during adult maturation of young honeybees. Olefin is the agonist of an nAChR expressed in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid is the agonist of a late-onset nAChR that is activated in 8-day-old bees. The implications of this finding for the honeybee biology are discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.",2003,10.1016/S0091-3057(03)00070-4,75,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,

Here, we studied how a residual dose of neonicotinoid (imidacloprid), combined with reproductive status (virgin and inseminated) affects honey bee queen’s metabolism. We conducted the same experiment in two geographical locations (Chile and Colombia) and found a strong reduction of standard metabolic rate (SMR) in insecticide-treated queens (Chilean queen bees 11.3% reduction in watt output; Colombian queen bees 11.7% reduction in watt output).

As such it is intrinsically toxic to insects and among them to the honey bee (Apis mellifera). An updated risk assessment is presented in the context of the regulatory evaluation of spinosad products and is in accordance with the latest recommendation of regulatory guidance documents. Results: The intrinsic toxicity to the honey bee as observed in laboratory conditions through oral and contact tests on adults does not appear to impair honey bee colonies when exposed to treated attractive crops in tunnel conditions. Reasons for this could include reduced availability of residues of the product on plant surface compared to laboratory conditions, together with a fast dissipation from treated plants and the absence of active degradation products. Conclusions: Spinosad products present a negligible impact on honey bees when used under the current label recommendations and conditions of agricultural use. This conclusion deduced from data available for the regulatory risk assessment has been confirmed by the feedback of surveys on incidents, which address the potential impact of spinosad products under realistic conditions of exposure, including other environmental and chemical factors that are common in cropped areas.",2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.032,437,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

Here, we applied a laboratory standard procedure (the proboscis-extension response conditioning) in order to assess which processes, acquisition, memory consolidation and/or memory retrieval were compromised after bees were fed either with thiacloprid or the formulation of thiacloprid named Calypso® at different sublethal doses. Extinction and generalization tests allowed us to investigate whether bees respond to a learned stimulus, and how selectively.

Neonicotinoids, such as Imidacloprid, are used in many crops and have been shown to be one of the pesticides groups with the most damaging effects on the health of bee colonies. The goals of this work were (1) to evaluate the ability of Melipona quadrifasciata, a native Brazilian stingless bee species, to detect the presence of Imidacloprid in artificial diets, and (2) to evaluate how this insecticide may affect their behavior. For this purpose, behavioral experiments were carried out in observation arenas where artificial flowers containing different concentrations of Imidacloprid (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) were made available to forager bees and their choice and behavior were registered. Our results showed that bee choices were not affected by the different concentrations of Imidacloprid, even at extremely high doses in the flowers (20%). It was also found that the presence of this insecticide interfered with the communication between individuals as a result of reduced antennation events. Both findings, the apparent inability of bees to detect the presence of the insecticide and the change in behavior caused by the exposition to the volatilized product, may rapidly lead to colony losses in nature.",2020,10.18406/2316-1817v12n120201411,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0
Effects of the novel pesticide flupyradifurone (Sivanto) on honeybee taste and cognition,775,JOUR,"['Hesselbach, H.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Scientific Reports,"Due to intensive agriculture honeybees are threatened by various pesticides. The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain. Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of ""Sivanto"" against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects. Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors studied here. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,10.1038/s41598-018-23200-0,8,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

Here, we challenged honey bee workers under in vivo colony conditions with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, the miticide tau-fluvalinate and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae, to investigate potential effects on longevity and behaviour using observation hives. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, our results do not suggest interactions among stressors, but rather lone effects of pesticides and the parasite on mortality and behaviour, respectively. These effects appear to be weak due to different outcomes at the two study sites, thereby suggesting that the role of thiacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and N.ceranae and interactions among them may have been overemphasized.

Examination of mass honey bee death at the entrance to hives in a paddy rice production district in Japan: The influence of insecticides sprayed on nearby rice fields,159,JOUR,"['Kimura, K.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Saiou, K.', 'Nirasawa, K.', 'Ishizaka, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Beekeepers in Japan have been finding as many as 1,000 dead honey bees piled up in front of hive entrances. They have observed that these mass bee deaths tend to occur at about the same time as measures are taken to control rice bugs, which appear every year during the summer in rice-producing districts. We set up and conducted controlled field studies from July to August in 2012 in a rice-producing district of northern Japan where frequent mass bee deaths are observed each summer. As had occurred in the area in previous years, and as we directly observed during our field investigations, masses of honey bees were found dead at the entrance to their hives. Samples of pollen and honey bee corpses were found to contain measurable concentrations of five active ingredients of insecticides: clothianidin, dinotefuran, ethiprole, etofenprox, and phenthoate. Insecticides containing these active ingredients are known to have been used for rice bug control in this area. Furthermore, we did not observe other known honey bee death agents in the area, such as mites and hornets. Thus, we suspected that the phenomenon of ""piled honey bee death"" (PD) at hive entrances is related to the influence of insecticides used to control rice bugs in paddies. The insecticide concentrations in dead honey bees were, however, extremely low compared with the median lethal dose (LD50) for honey bees. Moreover, PD was observed after rice anthesis, when bees would be collecting pollen from flowering plants other than rice. This calls into question any direct link between mass bee death and insecticides. Further study is necessary to understand insecticide exposure routes and the actual mechanism of the PD phenomenon. © IBRA 2014",2014,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.12,53,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,

Exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to three different active ingredients and two application methods for olive pest control,340,JOUR,"['Varikou, K', 'Garantonakis, N', 'Birouraki, A']",ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS,"A potential cause of bumblebee losses on farmland is probably the toxic effects of insecticides used against crop pests. The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is a major pest of olive trees in Mediterranean countries, so spray treatments (cover and bait sprays) are applied for this and other minor pests starting in early spring. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three pesticide spraying solutions (alpha-cypennethrin, dimethoate, and spinosad) and control methods used against olive fruit flies and other olive tree pests, on adult buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The results indicated that exposing worker bumblebees to enviromnentally realistic levels of these active ingredients in the laboratory resulted in high mortality rates of 34% (alpha-cypermethrin, cover spray) and 54% (alpha-cypermethrin, bait spray) at the end of the three-day exposure period. Bumblebees are probably at a high risk of mortality when they forage in olive groves with dry residues of a bait solution of a-cypennethrin (which resulted in 54% mortality in this study). Spinosad and dimethoate posed a lower risk of mortality for bumblebees. However, when the tested chemicals were applied to the whole tree canopy and without the bait attractant, the recorded mortality for dimethoate and a-cypennethrin was 8% and 34%, respectively. This study contributes to optimizing the use of the tested active ingredients as well as the applied control methods against managed pests, because it inflicts definite damage to populations of bumble bees and other non-target pollination.",2019,10.1127/entomologia/2019/0706,39,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,

These agrochemicals pollute the environment and can negatively impact human health, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Acetamiprid, an approved neonicotinoid pesticide in the EU, may exert sub-lethal effects on pollinators and other organisms. However, our knowledge on the scope and severity of such effects is still incomplete. Our experiments focused on the effects of the insecticide formulation Mospilan (active ingredient: 20% acetamiprid) on the peripheral olfactory detection of a synthetic floral blend and foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers. We found that the applied treatment did not affect the antennal detection of the floral blend; however, it induced alterations in their foraging behaviour. Pesticide-treated individuals started foraging later, and the probability of finding the floral blend was lower than that of the control bumblebees. However, exposed bumblebees found the scent source faster than the controls. These results suggest that acetamiprid-containing Mospilan may disrupt the activity and orientation of foraging bumblebees. We hypothesize that the observed effects of pesticide exposure on foraging behaviour could be mediated through neurophysiological and endocrine mechanisms. We propose that future investigations should clarify whether such sub-lethal effects can affect pollinators' population dynamics and their ecosystem services.",2024,10.1038/s41598-024-65388-4,14,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,
Extrapolating Acute Contact Bee Sensitivity to Insecticides Based on Body Weight Using a Phylogenetically Informed Interspecies Scaling Framework,632,JOUR,"['Pamminger, T.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Plant protection products, including insecticides, are important for global food production but can have adverse effects on nontarget organisms including bees. Historically, research investigating such effects has focused mainly on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), whereas less information is available for non-Apis bees. Consequently, a comprehensive hazard (sensitivity) assessment for the majority of bees is lacking, which in turn hinders accurate risk characterization and consequently bee protection. Interspecies sensitivity extrapolation based on body weight might be a way to improve the situation, but in the past such approaches often ignored the phylogenetic background of the species used, which in turn potentially reduces the robustness of such results. Published acute contact sensitivity data (median lethal dose per bee) of bees to insecticides, their body weight, and their phylogenetic background were used to build interspecies scaling models to predict bee sensitivity based on their weight. The results indicate that 1) bee body weight is a predictor of acute contact bee sensitivity to a range of insecticides, and 2) phylogeny (nonindependence of data points) needs to be considered in cross-species analysis, although it does not always confound the observed effects.

Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed. Spring bee losses, which corresponded with the sowing of corn-coated seed, seemed to be related to the casual encountering of drilling machine during foraging flight across the ploughed fields. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",2012,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01648.x,136,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
Field Efficacy of Synthetic and Botanical-Derived Insecticides against Melanaphis sacchari,287,JOUR,"Granados-Echegoyen, C.; Loera-Alvarado, G.; Miranda-Salcedo, M.A.; Hernández-Cruz, J.; Luna-Cruz, A.; Loera-Alvarado, E.",Southwestern Entomologist,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the field efficacy of commercial insecticides against Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner) and determine the diversity of non-Target species associated before and after treatment. Treatments were applied at 35 and 50 days after germination, and associated insects were sampled with yellow traps 48 hours after application of each product. Insect abundance differed significantly from the control that had 1,006 and 3,750 aphids on the first and second days of evaluation, with fewer aphids at the first sampling (35 days). The most effective products were flupyradifurone (Sivanto®), imidacloprid (Uniprid®), acephate (Unifate®), and Chenopodium ambrosioides botanical extract (Requiem®), with efficacies of 99.95% (0.5 aphids/plant), 99.05 (9.5 aphids/plant), 99.41% (6.0 aphids/plant), and 76.78% (233.5 aphids/plant) (Fn,3 = 19.78; df = 5,12; p < 0.001, r2= 0.8918), respectively. At the second sampling (50 days), efficacy of flupyradifurone was 100%, and Ch. ambrosioides plant-derived product and spinetoram (Palgus®) were opposite (Fn,3 = 43.14; df = 5,12; p < 0.001, r2= 0.9473). We collected 980 insects associated with sorghum, in five orders, 26 families, and 53 species of Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Neuroptera. Species richness increased as abundance decreased. Species richness and abundance were greatest at the first assessment. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was between 1.2 and 1.6 for the first assessment and 1.8 and 2.4 for the second evaluation.

Field agrochemical exposure impacts locomotor activity in wild bumblebees,217,JOUR,"['Strang, CG', 'Rondeau, S', 'Baert, N', 'Mcart, SH', 'Raine, NE', 'Muth, F']",ECOLOGY,"Agricultural intensification has been identified as one of the key causes of global insect biodiversity losses. These losses have been further linked to the widespread use of agrochemicals associated with modern agricultural practices. Many of these chemicals are known to have negative sublethal effects on commercial pollinators, such as managed honeybees and bumblebees, but less is known about the impacts on wild bees. Laboratory-based studies with commercial pollinators have consistently shown that pesticide exposure can impact bee behavior, with cascading effects on foraging performance, reproductive success, and pollination services. However, these studies typically assess only one chemical, neglecting the complexity of real-world exposure to multiple agrochemicals and other stressors. In the summer of 2020, we collected wild-foraging workers of the common eastern bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, from five squash (Cucurbita) agricultural sites (organic and conventional farms), selected to represent a range of agrochemical, including neonicotinoid insecticide, use. For each bee, we measured two behaviors relevant to foraging success and previously shown to be impacted by pesticide exposure: sucrose responsiveness and locomotor activity. Following behavioral testing, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) chemical analysis to detect and quantify the presence of 92 agrochemicals in each bumblebee. Bees collected from our sites did not vary in pesticide exposure as expected. While we found a limited occurrence of neonicotinoids, two fungicides (azoxystrobin and difenoconazole) were detected at all sites, and the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was present in all 123 bees. We found that bumblebees that contained higher levels of PBO were less active, and this effect was stronger for larger bumblebee workers. While PBO is unlikely to be the direct cause of the reduction in bee activity, it could be an indicator of exposure to pyrethroids and/or other insecticides that we were unable to directly quantify, but which PBO is frequently tank-mixed with during pesticide applications on crops. We did not find a relationship between agrochemical exposure and bumblebee sucrose responsiveness. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a sublethal behavioral impact of agrochemical exposure on wild-foraging bees.",2024,10.1002/ecy.4310,105,0.0,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,
Field rates of Sivanto™ (flupyradifurone) and Transform® (sulfoxaflor) increase oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),727,JOUR,"['Chakrabarti, P.', 'Carlson, E.A.', 'Lucas, H.M.', 'Melathopoulos, A.P.', 'Sagili, R.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Pesticide exposures can have detrimental impacts on bee pollinators, ranging from immediate mortality to sub-lethal impacts. Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto™ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform®. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted—a shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto™ and Transform®, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto™ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform® exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto™ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto™, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. © 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

Floral resource diversification promotes solitary bee reproduction and may offset insecticide effects – evidence from a semi-field experiment,659,JOUR,"['Klaus, F.', 'Tscharntke, T.', 'Bischoff, G.', 'Grass, I.']",Ecology Letters,"Pollinator declines in agricultural landscapes are driven by multiple stressors, but potential interactions of these remain poorly studied. Using a highly replicated semi-field study with 56 mesocosms of varying wild plant diversity (2–16 species) and oilseed rape treated with a neonicotinoid, we tested the interacting effects of resource diversity and insecticides on reproduction of a solitary wild bee. Compared to mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures, availability of resources from wild plants complementing oilseed rape doubled brood cell production. In addition, bee reproduction increased due to plant diversity and identity effects. Exposure to neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape reduced bee larval to adult development by 69%, but only in mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures. Availability of complementary flower resources can thus offset negative effects of neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape on wild bee reproduction. Policy should encourage the implementation of diverse floral resources mitigating negative effects of crop monocultures and insecticides, thereby sustaining solitary bee populations in agricultural landscapes. © 2021 The Authors.

"Following Regulation, Imidacloprid Persists and Flupyradifurone Increases in Nontarget Wildlife",414,JOUR,"['English, S.G.', 'Bishop, C.A.', 'Bieber, M.', 'Elliott, J.E.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"After regulation of pesticides, determination of their persistence in the environment is an important indicator of effectiveness of these measures. We quantified concentrations of two types of systemic insecticides, neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and butenolides (flupyradifurone), in off-crop nontarget media of hummingbird cloacal fluid, honey bee (Apis mellifera) nectar and honey, and wildflowers before and after regulation of imidacloprid on highbush blueberries in Canada in April 2021. We found that mean total pesticide load increased in hummingbird cloacal fluid, nectar, and flower samples following imidacloprid regulation. On average, we did not find evidence of a decrease in imidacloprid concentrations after regulation. However, there were some decreases, some increases, and other cases with no changes in imidacloprid levels depending on the specific media, time point of sampling, and site type. At the same time, we found an overall increase in flupyradifurone, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid but no change in clothianidin concentrations. In particular, flupyradifurone concentrations observed in biota sampled near agricultural areas increased twofold in honey bee nectar, sevenfold in hummingbird cloacal fluid, and eightfold in flowers after the 2021 imidacloprid regulation. The highest residue detected was flupyradifurone at 665 ng/mL (parts per billion [ppb]) in honey bee nectar. Mean total pesticide loads were highest in honey samples (84 ± 10 ppb), followed by nectar (56 ± 7 ppb), then hummingbird cloacal fluid (1.8 ± 0.5 ppb), and least, flowers (0.51 ± 0.06 ppb). Our results highlight that limited regulation of imidacloprid does not immediately reduce residue concentrations, while other systemic insecticides, possibly replacement compounds, concurrently increase in wildlife.

Gut microbiota composition is associated with environmental landscape in honey bees,857,JOUR,"['Jones, J.C.', 'Fruciano, C.', 'Hildebrand, F.', 'Al Toufalilia, H.', 'Balfour, N.J.', 'Bork, P.', 'Engel, P.', 'Ratnieks, F.L.W.', 'Hughes, W.O.H.']",Ecology and Evolution,"There is growing recognition that the gut microbial community regulates a wide variety of important functions in its animal hosts, including host health. However, the complex interactions between gut microbes and environment are still unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that host a core gut microbial community that is thought to be constant across populations. Here, we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two main landscape types for 6 weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterized and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. While previous studies have delineated a characteristic core set of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut, our results suggest that the broad environment that bees are exposed to has some influence on the relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. This includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape exposure on honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential effect of exposure to different environmental parameters, such as forage type and neonicotinoid pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria. This work emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between the host, its gut bacteria, and the environment and identifies target microbial taxa for functional analyses. © 2017 The Authors.

High pesticide exposure and risk to bees in pollinator plantings adjacent to conventionally managed blueberry fields,306,JOUR,"['Graham, KK', 'McArt, S', 'Isaacs, R']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Wildflower plantings adjacent to agricultural fields provide diverse floral resources and nesting sites for wild bees. However, their proximity to pest control activities in the crop may result in pesticide exposure if pesticides drift into pollinator plantings. To quantify pesticide residues in pollinator plantings, we sampled flowers and soil from pollinator plantings and compared them to samples from unenhanced field margins and crop row middles. At conventionally managed farms, flowers from pollinator plantings had similar exposure profiles to those from unenhanced field margins or crop row middles, with multiple pesticides and high and similar risk quotient (RQ) values (with pollinator planting RQ: 3.9; without pollinator planting RQ: 4.0). Whereas samples from unsprayed sites had significantly lower risk (RQ: 0.005). Soil samples had overall low risk to bees. Additionally, we placed bumble bee colonies ( Bombus impatiens ) in field margins of crop fields with and without pollinator plantings and measured residues in bee -collected pollen. Pesticide exposure was similar in pollen from sites with or without pollinator plantings, and risk was generally high (with pollinator planting RQ: 0.5; without pollinator planting RQ: 1.1) and not significant between the two field types. Risk was lower at sites where there was no pesticide activity (RQ: 0.3), but again there was no significant difference between management types. The insecticide phosmet, which is used on blueberry farms for control of Drosophila suzukii , accounted for the majority of elevated risk. Additionally, analysis of pollen collected by bumble bees found no significant difference in floral species richness between sites with or without pollinator plantings. Our results suggest that pollinator plantings do not reduce pesticide risk and do not increase pollen diversity collected by B. impatiens , further highlighting the need to reduce exposure through enhanced IPM adoption, drift mitigation, and removal of attractive flowering weeds prior to insecticide applications.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171248,922,0.0,0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,
High-throughput monitoring of wild bee diversity and abundance via mitogenomics,370,JOUR,"['Tang, M', 'Hardman, CJ', 'Ji, YQ', 'Meng, GL', 'Liu, SL', 'Tan, MH', 'Yang, SZ', 'Moss, ED', 'Wang, JX', 'Yang, CX', 'Bruce, C', 'Nevard, T', 'Potts, SG', 'Zhou, X', 'Yu, DW']",METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"1. Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.",2015,10.1111/2041-210X.12416,6,0.0,0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
Honey Bee Survival and Pathogen Prevalence: From the Perspective of Landscape and Exposure to Pesticides,191,JOUR,"['Alburaki, M', 'Chen, D', 'Skinner, JA', 'Meikle, WG', 'Tarpy, DR', 'Adamczyk, J', 'Stewart, SD']",INSECTS,"In order to study the in situ effects of the agricultural landscape and exposure to pesticides on honey bee health, sixteen honey bee colonies were placed in four different agricultural landscapes. Those landscapes were three agricultural areas with varying levels of agricultural intensity (AG areas) and one non-agricultural area (NAG area). Colonies were monitored for different pathogen prevalence and pesticide residues over a period of one year. RT-qPCR was used to study the prevalence of seven different honey bee viruses as well as Nosema sp. in colonies located in different agricultural systems with various intensities of soybean, corn, sorghum, and cotton production. Populations of the parasitic mite Varroa destructor were also extensively monitored. Comprehensive MS-LC pesticide residue analyses were performed on samples of wax, honey, foragers, winter bees, dead bees, and crop flowers for each apiary and location. A significantly higher level of varroa loads were recorded in colonies of the AG areas, but this at least partly correlated with increased colony size and did not necessarily result from exposure to pesticides. Infections of two viruses (deformed wing virus genotype a (DWVa) and acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV)) and Nosema sp. varied among the four studied locations. The urban location significantly elevated colony pathogen loads, while AG locations significantly benefited and increased the colony weight gain. Cotton and sorghum flowers contained high concentrations of insecticide including neonicotinoids, while soybean and corn had less pesticide residues. Several events of pesticide toxicity were recorded in the AG areas, and high concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides were detected in dead bees.",2018,10.3390/insects9020065,9,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,
Honey bees and bumble bees may be exposed to pesticides differently when foraging on agricultural areas,479,JOUR,"['Zioga, E.', 'White, B.', 'Stout, J.C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"In an agricultural environment, where crops are treated with pesticides, bees are likely to be exposed to a range of chemical compounds in a variety of ways. The extent to which different bee species are affected by these chemicals, largely depends on the concentrations and type of exposure. We quantified the presence of selected pesticide compounds in the pollen of two different entomophilous crops; oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Sampling was performed in 12 sites in Ireland and our results were compared with the pollen loads of honey bees and bumble bees actively foraging on those crops in those same sites. Detections were compound specific, and the timing of pesticide application in relation to sampling likely influenced the final residue contamination levels. Most detections originated from compounds that were not recently applied on the fields, and samples from B. napus fields were more contaminated compared to those from V. faba fields. Crop pollen was contaminated only with fungicides, honey bee pollen loads contained mainly fungicides, while more insecticides were detected in bumble bee pollen loads. The highest number of compounds and most detections were observed in bumble bee pollen loads, where notably, all five neonicotinoids assessed (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were detected despite the no recent application of these compounds on the fields where samples were collected. The concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides were positively correlated with the number of wild plant species present in the bumble bee-collected pollen samples, but this relationship could not be verified for honey bees. The compounds azoxystrobin, boscalid and thiamethoxam formed the most common pesticide combination in pollen.

The prevalence of the honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), changing climate, and the rise of vector-borne honeybee diseases by Varroa destructor, have played a major role in the rapid decline of global honeybee populations. Honeybees are environmentally and economically significant actors in biodiversity. The impact of agricultural practices, such as pesticide use, has exacerbated the negative effects on honeybees. We demonstrate the synergistic effect of cocktails of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and acetamiprid on honeybee haemocytes. Two genes responsible for critical immune responses, spaetzle and myD88, are consistently dysregulated following exposure to either neonicotinoid alone or as a mixture with or without an immune challenge.

Imidacloprid increases the prevalence of the intestinal parasite Lotmaria passim in honey bee workers,422,JOUR,"['Erban, T.', 'Parizkova, K.', 'Sopko, B.', 'Talacko, P.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Jarosova, J.', 'Votypka, J.']",Science of the Total Environment,"A challenge in bee protection is to assess the risks of pesticide-pathogen interactions. Lotmaria passim, a ubiquitous unicellular parasite in honey bees, is considered harmful under specific conditions. Imidacloprid causes unpredictable side effects. Research indicates that both L. passim and imidacloprid may affect the physiology, behavior, immunity, microbiome and lifespan of honey bees. We designed cage experiments to test whether the infection of L. passim is affected by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. Workers collected at the time of emergence were exposed to L. passim and 2.5 μg/L imidacloprid in the coexposure treatment group. First, samples of bees were taken from cages since they were 5 days old and 3 days postinfection, i.e., after finishing an artificial 24 h L. passim infection. Additional bees were collected every two additional days. In addition, bees frozen at the time of emergence and collected from the unexposed group were analyzed. Abdomens were analyzed using qPCR to determine parasite load, while corresponding selected heads were subjected to a label-free proteomic analysis. Our results show that bees are free of L. passim at the time of emergence. Furthermore, imidacloprid considerably increased the prevalence as well as parasite loads in individual bees. This means that imidacloprid facilitates infection, enabling faster parasite spread in a colony and potentially to surrounding colonies. The proteomic analysis of bee heads showed that imidacloprid neutralized the increased transferrin 1 expression by L. passim. Importantly, this promising marker has been previously observed to be upregulated by infections, including gut parasites. This study contributes to understanding the side effects of imidacloprid and demonstrates that a single xenobiotic/pesticide compound can interact with the gut parasite. Our methodology can be used to assess the effects of different compounds on L. passim. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166973,905,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,

Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, are widely regarded as a substantial contributing factor to the decline in bumblebee populations, as evidenced by the detrimental impacts documented across many stages of their life cycle. Mating is vital for the population maintenance of bumblebees. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research conducted on the effects of pesticides on the mating process. In this study, we individually examined the impact of imidacloprid on the mating behavior of bumblebee males and queens. A competitive mating experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect on the competitive prowess of male individuals and the mate selection behavior of female individuals. The study revealed that the mating rate of bumblebees exposed to a concentration of 10 ppb of imidacloprid was 3 %. This finding demonstrated a statistically significant impact when compared to the control group, which exhibited a mating rate of 58 % in the normal mating experiment. Furthermore, in the competitive mating experiment, we found that the competitive mating success rate of treated males (1 %) was significantly lower than that of untreated males (35 %). Hence, it provides evidence that neonicotinoid imidacloprid negatively affects bumblebee mating success and cautions us to protect bumblebees from pesticide exposure to prevent a severe impact on their populations.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172525,928,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,
Imidacloprid-induced facilitation of the proboscis extension reflex habituation in the honeybee,1009,JOUR,"['Lambin, M.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Raymond, S.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology,"Imidacloprid is a new insecticide from the family of the neonicotinoids, which interact with the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The effects of imidacloprid at a dose that does not affect sensory or motor functions are studied on non-associative learning abilities in the honeybee. The behavioral procedure is the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Imidacloprid topically applied on the thorax (1 μl) at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee induces an increase of the gustatory threshold defined as the lowest concentration of a sucrose solution applied to the antennae able to elicit the PER. The ability of the honeybee to move in an open-field-like apparatus is impaired at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee. These effects are amplified with time and reach a maximum 60 min after application. The lowest dose of 1.25 ng/bee has no effect on the gustatory function but increases the motor activity and facilitates the PER habituation independently of time. This result fits our hypothesis that a slight activation of the cholinergic system with a low dose of imidacloprid can facilitate a simple form of learning in the honeybee. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Queen failure is considered a relevant cause of colony losses, yet few data exist concerning effects of environmental stressors on queens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that exposure to field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid pesticides can severely affect the immunocompetence of queens of western honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). In young queens exposed to thiacloprid (200 μg/l or 2000 μg/l) or clothianidin (10 μg/l or 50 μg/l), the total hemocyte number and the proportion of active, differentiated hemocytes was significantly reduced. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence namely the wound healing/melanisation response, as well as the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph were impaired. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of queens, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,10.1038/s41598-017-04734-1,7,,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,
In vivo distribution and metabolisation of 14C-imidacloprid in different compartments of Apis mellifera L,51,JOUR,"['Suchail, S.', 'De Sousa, G.', 'Rahmani, R.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Pest Management Science,"In vivo distribution of the neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, was followed during 72 h in six biological compartments of Apis mellifera L: head, thorax, abdomen, haemolymph, midgut and rectum. Honeybees were treated orally with 100 μg of 14C-imidacloprid per kg of bee, a dose close to the median lethal dose. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity in honeybee was 25 h. Haemolymph was the compartment with the lowest and rectum that with the highest level of total radioactivity during the whole study, with a maximum 24 h after treatment. Elimination half-life of imidacloprid in whole honeybee was 5 h. Imidacloprid was readily distributed and metabolised only by Phase I enzymes into five metabolites: 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxy- imidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and olefin and urea derivatives. The guanidine derivative was not detected. The urea derivative and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the main metabolites and appeared particularly in midgut and rectum. The olefin derivative and 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid preferentially occurred in head, thorax and abdomen, which are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues. Moreover, they presented a peak value around 4 h after imidacloprid ingestion.

The distribution of acetamiprid and its metabolites was monitored over a 72-h period in six biological compartments: head, thorax, abdomen, haemolymph, midgut and rectum. Honeybees were treated orally with 100 μg [14C]-acetamiprid kg-1 bee, a dose which is about 1500 times lower than the median lethal dose. After 72 h, only 40% of the total radioactivity was eliminated, suggesting that acetamiprid and its metabolites tended to persist in the honeybee. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed in all compartments and metabolized. Just after administration, radioactivity was mainly localized in the abdomen and subsequently in the rectum. After 72 h, the maximum amount of radioactivity (about 20% of the ingested dose) was detected again in the abdomen, whereas the lowest level of total radioactivity was detected in the haemolymph. Radioactivity in the head did not exceed 7.6% of total ingested radioactivity. More than 50% of acetamiprid was metabolised in less than 30 min, indicating a very short half-life for the compound. During the first hours, acetamiprid was mainly detected in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues: abdomen, thorax and head. Of the seven metabolites detected, the major ones were 6-choronicotinic acid and an unknown metabolite called U1, which was present mainly in the rectum, the thorax and the head.

Influence of honey bee seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on diet behavior and susceptibility to imidacloprid,579,JOUR,"['Alburaki, M.', 'Madella, S.', 'Vu, P.', 'Corona, M.']",Apidologie,"Honey bee Apis mellifera L. colonies produce two distinct phenotypes of workers during summer and winter to cope with drastic seasonal variations in climate and food resources. Imidacloprid (IMP) is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture for pest management control. In this study, we investigate the influence of seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on the diet behavior of bees fed ad libitum two concentrations of IMP. We performed three independent two-choice feeding experiments using summer bees either emerged in the laboratory or in-hive and winter bees. Diet behavior post-ingestive aversion responses to IMP were investigated as well as potential affinity to the physical location and contents of the diets. Caged bees were challenged with a physical rotation of the diet’s location and their susceptibility to 5 and 20 PPB of IMP was tested. From a behavioral standpoint, our results show that winter bees expressed no affinity to the physical location of the diet but rather to its content and strongly favored IMP-tainted syrup at both 5 and 20 PPB. The opposite was recorded for naïve summer bees that emerged in the laboratory, which avoided the tainted syrup at both concentrations, particularly at 20 PPB. Summer bees emerged in-hive, expected to have developed a mature intestinal microbiota through trophallaxis from older bee-mates, were mainly neutral, and showed no affinity to the diet location nor its contents. Our results indicate that the physiological changes associated with seasonal phenotype and initial exposure to older mates have important consequences on the bee diet behavior toward pesticides. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00922-9,53,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
Influence of pesticide use in fruit orchards during blooming on honeybee mortality in 4 experimental apiaries,59,JOUR,"['Calatayud-Vernich, P', 'Calatayud, F', 'Simó, E', 'Suarez-Varela, MM', 'Picó, Y']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Samples of dead honey bees (Apismellifera L.) were collected periodically from4 different locations during citrus and stone fruit trees blooming season to evaluate the potential impact of agrochemicals on honey bee death rate. For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental hives entrance located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against varroosis in the experimental hives, was detected in 94% of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80% of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68% dimethoate, and 32% imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223 ng/g respectively.

"Insecticide Residues Associated with Apple Orchard Treatments in the Mason Bee, Osmia cornifrons, and their Nests",469,JOUR,"['Suzuki, T.', 'Ikegami, M.', 'Goka, K.', 'Sakamoto, Y.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Declines in bee populations, in part due to pesticides, especially insecticides, are of global concern. Although most studies have investigated insecticide residues in honeybees and bumblebees, few have focused on non-Apis solitary bees, which are considered essential pollinators in the field. Most non-Apis bees are solitary and build their nests in the ground or in tree holes, therefore insecticide exposure pathways would differ from those of honeybees and bumblebees. We analyzed the residues of 20 insecticides in Osmia cornifrons bees and their pollen-provisions and nesting materials, along with adult honeybees, soil, and wildflowers collected in four apple orchards in two regions in Japan. Few insecticides were common among adult bees, pollen-provisions, and wildflowers. Insecticides applied in orchards were detected at high frequency: chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide, and diazinon were detected in almost all samples. Insecticides without a known history of application were detected from various samples at frequencies ranging from 0% to 100%. Even in orchards without a known history of insecticide application, clothianidin was detected in many sample types and at high concentration. A purple deadnettle sample had the highest concentration at 17.5 mg/kg. These results highlight the complexity of pathways of insecticide exposure to O. cornifrons in the environment because insecticides may remain in the environment for long periods and wild bees may forage farther than previously known distances. Furthermore, each sample type contained different insecticides, so wild bees may have been exposed to different insecticides at different life stages. Future research should prioritize wide-scale measurements of insecticide residues in field conditions and toxicity testing with multiple exposures at different life stages of target species.

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals. Relevant future perspectives are briefly addressed to integrate MoA, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and toxicokinetic information for the refinement of single-chemical/combined toxicity predictions and risk estimates at different levels of biological organization in the bee health context.",2020,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139243,735,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,
Interaction between Varroa destructor and imidacloprid reduces flight capacity of honeybees,916,JOUR,"['Blanken, L.J.', 'van Langevelde, F.', 'van Dooremalen, C.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Current high losses of honeybees seriously threaten crop pollination. Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The data set comprises reports from a total of 6,655 beekeepers and 129,428 wintered honey bee colonies. Regions surrounding the beekeeping operations were assigned to one of six clusters according to their composition of land use categories by use of a hierarchical cluster analysis, allowing a rough distinction between urban regions, regions predominated by semi-natural areas and pastures, and mainly agricultural environments. We ran a Generalised Linear Mixed Model and found winter colony mortality significantly affected by operation size, year, and cluster membership, but also by the interaction of year and cluster membership. Honey bee colonies in regions composed predominantly of semi-natural areas, coniferous forests and pastures had the lowest loss probability in four out of six years, and loss probabilities within these regions were significantly lower in five out of six years compared to those within regions composed predominantly of artificial surfaces, broad-leaved and coniferous forest.",2018,10.1038/s41598-018-30891-y,8,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,

Assuming bees can forage naturally on pesticide-contaminated or noncontaminated areas, we investigated whether water supply influences the choice between neonicotinoid-dosed or nondosed feeders and on mortality of the stingless bee, Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, Hymenoptera, Apidae). At the field concentration, there was no significant mortality; however, the bees were not able to distinguish the feeders. In the cages containing high-concentration feeders, with water supply, the bees preferred nondosed food, and with no water, the mortality increased. Considering that in the field it is common to find extrapolated concentrations, our work suggested that water may allow avoidance of high dosed food and minimize mortality.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

"Laboratory Determination of Particulate-Matter–Bound Agrochemical Toxicity among Honeybees, Mason Bees, and Painted Lady Butterflies",482,JOUR,"['Green, F.B.', 'Muñoz, S.R.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Pollinator population declines are global phenomena with severe consequences for native flora and agriculture. Many factors have contributed to pollinator declines including habitat loss, climate change, disease and parasitism, reductions in abundance and diversity of foraging resources, and agrochemical exposure. Particulate matter (PM) serves as a carrier of toxic agrochemicals, and pollinator mortality can occur following exposure to agrochemical-contaminated PM. Therefore, laboratory-controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate impacts of individual PM-bound agrochemicals. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria), and painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) larvae were exposed to bifenthrin, permethrin, clothianidin, imidacloprid, abamectin, and ivermectin via suspended, airborne PM. Agrochemical concentrations in PM to which pollinators were exposed were based on concentrations observed in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM including a “mean” treatment and a “max” treatment reflective of reported mean and maximum PM-bound agrochemical concentrations, respectively. In general, pollinators in the mean and max treatments experienced significantly higher mortality compared with controls. Honeybees were most sensitive to pyrethroids, mason bees were most sensitive to neonicotinoids, and painted lady butterfly larvae were most sensitive to macrocyclic lactones. Overall, pollinator mortality was quite low relative to established toxic effect levels derived from traditional pollinator contact toxicity tests. Furthermore, pollinator mortality resulting from exposure to individual agrochemicals via PM was less than that reported to occur at beef cattle feedyards, highlighting the importance of mixture toxicity to native and managed pollinator survival and conservation.

Firstly, residues of clothianidin and its active metabolites thiazolylnitroguanidine and thiazolylmethylurea were measured in nectar and pollen from Elado®-dressed (test site, T) and undressed (reference site, R) oilseed rape collected by honey bees confined within tunnel tents. Clothianidin and its metabolites could not be detected or quantified in samples from R fields. Clothianidin concentrations in samples from T fields were 1.3 ± 0.9 μg/kg and 1.7 ± 0.9 μg/kg in nectar and pollen, respectively. Secondly, pollen and nectar for residue analyses were sampled from free flying honey bees, bumble bees and mason bees, placed at six study locations each in the R and T sites at the start of oilseed rape flowering. Honey samples were analysed from all honey bee colonies at the end of oilseed rape flowering. Neither clothianidin nor its metabolites were detectable or quantifiable in R site samples.

The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifur-one (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF. We suggest that pesticide RA also test for common chemical mixture synergies on behaviour and survival.",2019,10.1098/rspb.2019.0433,286,,0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

However, in field realistic conditions mixtures of products classified as harmless to bees can lead to a synergistic increase of toxicity on honey bees, as known for ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides combined with pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. For substances like fertilizers, usually no information on potential side effects on bees is available. Initially, effects from tank mixes containing insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers were investigated under laboratory conditions by use of a spray chamber contact test. For selected combinations, higher tier studies were carried out. Mixtures containing thiacloprid, boscalid and dimoxystrobin with boron fertilizers showed no increase of mortality. In contrast, tank mixes of thiacloprid formulations and EBI-fungicides resulted within 24 h in synergistic mortality increase in laboratory, semi-field and field. Actually, a short time interval of 24 h between individually applied potentially synergistic products like pyrethroid insecticides and EBI fungicides led to an increase of mortality up to 100% under laboratory conditions, indicating that the detoxification was still ongoing, resulting in an increased susceptibility for other stressors during the metabolization process. In conclusion, tank mixtures do not always lead to an increase of honey bee toxicity. However, former published findings about synergistic impacts between neonicotinoides and EBI-fungicides could be confirmed. The findings of our and other higher tier studies finally prompted the competent regulatory authority (BVL) to regulate these mixtures by restriction NB6613 since September 2018.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,
Low Concentration of Quercetin Reduces the Lethal and Sublethal Effects of Imidacloprid on Apis cerana (Hymenoptera: Apidae),622,JOUR,"['Liu, J.', 'Li, Y.', 'Zhang, Z.', 'Luo, W.', 'Cao, L.', 'Liu, H.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Large-scale use of systemic pesticides has been considered a potential factor for pollinator population decline. Phytochemicals, e.g., quercetin, have been demonstrated to increase the pesticide tolerance of Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), which is helpful to develop strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to pollinators. In this study, we hypothesized phytochemicals could reduce the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on Apis cerana Fabricius. The lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana workers were investigated. The results showed that A. cerana workers chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid had a significantly shorter longevity by 10.81 d compared with control. Acute exposure to imidacloprid at 100 μg/liter impaired the sucrose responsiveness and memory retention of the workers, and 20 μg/liter reduced the sucrose responsiveness. The treatment with 37.8 mg/liter quercetin for 24 h could increase the longevity of A. cerana workers when chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid, and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin feeding treatment alleviated the impairment of sucrose responsiveness. However, workers treated with 151.2 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin had a significantly shorter longevity compared to that of bees chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid without quercetin treatment. Our results suggested that quercetin treatment could produce a biphasic influence on the lethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana. Quercetin at 37.8 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter in the diet before pesticide exposure was able to reduce the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, respectively, providing potential strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to native honey bees (A. cerana).  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Low concentrations of imidacloprid affect the survival of Tetragona clavipes in a short period of exposure (24 h),413,JOUR,"['de Oliveira, A.A.', 'Carvalho, L.O.', 'dos Santos, H.V.R.', 'de Oliveira, L.R.G.R.', 'Saraiva, A.S.']",Apidologie,"Neonicotinoid pesticides are widely used to control insect pests in agriculture and livestock production. However, they have been found to negatively affect bees, especially Apis mellifera. Despite this, little research has been conducted on the impact of neonicotinoids on other bee species, including native ones. This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI). The Tetragona clavipes (bee native to Brazil) were exposed to eight concentrations of IMI-based insecticide, through contaminated food or mist (350 µL/min) for 24 h. The LC10-24 h, LC50-24 h, LC90-24 h in acute topical effect (ATE) and acute residual effect (ARE) of IMI-based insecticide against bees were calculated. The LC10-24 h, LC50-24 h, and LC90-24 h in ARE were found to be more toxic compared to ATE. In summary, the study highlights that even low levels of IMI can significantly reduce bee survival within 24 h.

Many-fold less than the field recommended concentrations of neonicotinoids and malathion affect foraging of honeybee in three important crops in India,910,JOUR,"['Olotu, M.I.', 'Gujar, G.T.']",Entomon,"Although insecticides effectively control the insect pests in different agro-ecosystems, they also reportedly affect the non-target insects including bee pollinators at the sub-lethal concentrations. A series of field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of two neonicotinoids and one organophosphate insecticide on the foraging activity of honeybee in three test crops at the sub-lethal concentration during flowering. The mean number of the dwarf honeybee (DHB), Apis florea (F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) recorded during the pre-spraying did not differ between treatments on each of the three crops. However, it differed significantly during the post-spraying except for malathion on inflorescences of the pearl millet. The DHB foraging time remained generally constant during the pre-spraying and varied greatly during the post-spraying on the three test crops and both groups of insecticides. The neonicotinoids and malathion significantly reduced visits of the DHB on the inflorescences of the test crops, their foraging activities and time spent on the inflorescences at the concentration many-fold (5-50 fold) less than the field recommended concentration of the insecticide. © 2016 Association for Advancement of Entomology. © 2016 Association for Advancement of Entomology.",2016,,41,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
Metabolism of imidacloprid in Apis mellifera,111,JOUR,"['Suchail, S.', 'Debrauwer, L.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Pest Management Science,"Biotransformation of imidacloprid and the appearance of olefin and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid metabolites in the honeybee were studied by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Honeybees were treated orally with imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg-1 bee. Imidacloprid was metabolised relatively quickly and thoroughly. Twenty minutes after the beginning of imidacloprid ingestion, the sum of the residues from the three compounds amounted to only 70% of the actual given dose. Imidacloprid, 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin represented, respectively, 50%, 9% and 8% of the actual ingested dose. Six and 24h, respectively, after ingestion of imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg -1 bee, imidacloprid could no longer be detected in the honeybee. Imidacloprid had a half-life ranging between 4.5 and 5h and was rapidly metabolised into 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin. Except 5-hydroxyimidacloprid in the 20 μg kg-1 treatment, these two metabolites presented a peak value 4h after ingestion of the 20 and 50 μg kg-1 doses. This time fully coincided with the appearance of mortality induced by imidacloprid after acute oral intoxication. These results suggested that the immediate neurotoxicity symptoms are due to the action of imidacloprid, whereas 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and/or olefin are involved in honeybee mortality. In addition, it was likely that the 30% of residues undetected 20min after intoxication were imidacloprid metabolites, although not 5-hydroxyimidacloprid or olefin. Thus, 5-hydroxyirnidacloprid and olefin could not be the major metabolites in the worker bees. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.",2004,10.1002/ps.772,60,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
Metabolomics unveils the influence of dietary phytochemicals on residual pesticide concentrations in honey bees,630,JOUR,"['Ardalani, H.', 'Vidkjær, N.H.', 'Kryger, P.', 'Fiehn, O.', 'Fomsgaard, I.S.']",Environment International,"The losses of honey bee colonies and declines of other insect pollinators have been associated with negative effects of pesticides. Honey bees as well as other pollinators are nectar and pollen foragers and thus are exposed to an extensive range of phytochemicals. Understanding the synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects of plant secondary metabolites and pesticides in honey bees may help to protect honey bee colonies against agrochemicals. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the impact of dietary phytochemical composition on the residual concentration of three pesticides: imidacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and tebuconazole in exposed honey bees. Honey bees were given different diets based on pollen or nectar from four plants: Reseda odorata, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Trifolium repens for two days. Thereafter, they were orally exposed to 10 ng/bee imidacloprid or contact-exposed to 0.9 μg/bee tau-fluvalinate or 5 μg/bee tebuconazole. After 1 h of oral exposure or 24 h of contact exposure, the honey bees were anaesthetised with CO2, sacrificed by freezing, extracted with a validated QuEChERS method, and residual pesticide concentrations were determined by LC-QTRAP-MS/MS. The phytochemical composition in the given diets were profiled with an UHPLC-Q Exactive-MS/MS. The results revealed that the dietary phytochemical composition has a noteworthy influence on the concentration of residual pesticides in honey bees. The correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that flavonoids have a reducing effect on the residual concentration of imidacloprid and tau-fluvalinate in honey bees. The results also highlighted that exposure to imidacloprid impaired the metabolism of sugars in honey bees. Exploiting flavonoid-rich plants may protect honey bees against pesticides and hold promise as forage plants in future beekeeping. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106503,152,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,
Mild chronic exposure to pesticides alters physiological markers of honey bee health without perturbing the core gut microbiota,166,JOUR,"['Almasri, H', 'Liberti, J', 'Brunet, JL', 'Engel, P', 'Belzunces, LP']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Recent studies highlighted that exposure to glyphosate can affect specific members of the core gut microbiota of honey bee workers. However, in this study, bees were exposed to relatively high glyphosate concentrations. Here, we chronically exposed newly emerged honey bees to imidacloprid, glyphosate and difenoconazole, individually and in a ternary mixture, at an environmental concentration of 0.1 mu g/L. We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals exhibit a dysbiosis (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota). This highlights the importance of an early establishment of a healthy gut bacterial community to strengthen the natural defenses of the honey bee against xenobiotic stressors.",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-08009-2,12,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,
Milkweed in agricultural field margins - A neonicotinoid exposure route for pollinators at multiple life stages,403,JOUR,"['Naujokaitis-Lewis, I.', 'Endicott, S.', 'Gaudreault, E.', 'Maisonneuve, F.', 'Robinson, S.A.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Neonicotinoid insecticides move from targeted crops to wildflowers located in adjacent field margins, acting as a potential exposure source for wild pollinators and insect species of conservation concern, including monarch butterflies. Monarchs rely on milkweed over multiple life stages, including as a host plant for eggs and a food source for both larvae (leaves) and adults (flowers). Milkweeds, which are closely associated with field margins, can contain neonicotinoid residues, but previous assessments are constrained to a single plant tissue type. In 2017 and 2018, we sampled milkweeds from 95 field margins adjacent to crop fields (corn, soybean, hay, wheat, and barley) in agricultural landscapes of eastern Ontario, Canada. Milkweeds were sampled during the flower blooming period and leaves and flower tissues were analysed. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid were detected. Maximum concentrations in leaf samples included 10.30 ng/g of clothianidin in 2017, and 24.4 ng/g of thiamethoxam in 2018. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam percent detections in flowers (72 % and 61 %, respectively) were significantly higher than detections in leaves (24 % and 31 %, respectively). Thiamethoxam concentrations were significantly higher in paired flower samples than leaf samples (median 0.33 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g) while clothianidin concentrations also trended higher in flowers (median 0.18–0.55 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g). Only thiamethoxam showed significant differences between years, and we found no effect of crop type, with hay, soybean and corn fields all yielding 50–56 % detections in leaves. We found significantly higher concentrations in older milkweed flowers than young flowers or leaves (medians 0.87 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g and 0.45 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g for clothianidin and thiamethoxam, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of considering variation in milkweed tissue type and age of flowers in neonicotinoid exposure risk assessments. Efforts to increase milkweed availability in agricultural landscapes should consider how exposure to neonicotinoids can be mitigated. © 2024",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175622,951,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,

The main objective of the present study was to design and apply an integrative protocol to monitor honeybee colony activity and sample collection by using electronic technologies combined with classical methods in order to evaluate the exposure of honeybees to the neonicotinoids that are used in melliferous intensive crops. The monitored honeybee colonies were especially prepared and equipped to maximize their chances to collect representative samples in order to express, as well as possible, the pesticide residues that existed in the targeted crops. The samples of honey, pollen and honeybees were collected, preserved and prepared to fulfill the required quality and quantity criteria of the accredited laboratories. In total, a set of fifty samples was collected from fields, located in different areas of intensive agriculture in Romania, and was analyzed for five neonicotinoids. The obtained results show that 48% of the total analyzed samples (n = 50) contained one or more detected or quantified neonicotinoid residues. The main conclusion is that the proposed approach for sample collection and preparation could improve the evaluation methodologies for analyzing honeybees' exposure to pesticides. © 2020 by the authors.",2020,10.3390/d12010024,12,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,

"Neonicotinoid Pesticides Cause Mass Fatalities of Native Bumble Bees: A Case Study from Wilsonville, Oregon, United States",118,JOUR,"['Hatfield, R.G.', 'Strange, J.P.', 'Koch, J.B.', 'Jepsen, S.', 'Stapleton, I.']",Environmental Entomology,"In June of 2013 an application of dinotefuran on an ornamental planting of European linden trees (Tilia cordata Mill. [Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. It is likely that the vast majority of mass pesticide kills of beneficial insects across other environments go unnoticed and unreported. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Neonicotinoid seed treatment products - Occurrence and relevance of guttation for honeybee colonies,1043,CONF,"['Nikolakis, A', 'Keppler, J', 'Miles, M', 'Schoening, R']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES: 12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE ICP-PR BEE PROTECTION GROUP,"Background: Guttation is a natural botanical phenomenon and describes the active excretion of liquid water (guttation fluid) by some vascular plants in form of droplets on the tips of leaves or on leaf edges. Guttation fluid may contain neonicotinoid residues after plant uptake from seed treatments. To clarify the relevance of the guttation fluid as a water source for honey bee colonies and to assess potential associated risks under conditions of agronomic practice, various studies were performed in key broad acre crops such as maize, sugar beet, potato (in-furrow application), winter barley and oilseed rape by placing honeybee colonies adjacent to freshly emerged fields for several weeks and by following up potential lethal and sub-lethal effects, as well as potential effects on colony performance. Results: Guttation droplets contained peak residue levels theoretically capable of harming individual honeybees (i.e. several hundred ppm). Residue levels, however, generally decreased with time, as expected based on the physiological process involved. The temporal coincidence of honeybee flight activity and the presence of guttation droplets were generally limited to early morning hours and to a much lesser extent to evening hours. Spatially, honeybees were found to predominately collect water, if any, in the direct vicinity of the hives. Water collection generally ceased within a couple of metres distance to the hives, which renders distance to the crop to be a significant exposure factor, and in turn renders dew and guttation from off-crop vegetation to be more relevant to water collecting honeybees than guttation from the crop. Mortality events, if any, were scarce and generally matched in treatments and in controls. The absolute numbers of dead bees involved in these rare cases were so low that they did not translate into any colony level effects or impacts on bee health or overwintering success, nor on adverse effects on honey production of the involved colonies. Conclusions: Given the overall body of data, the associated intensity of the assessments in each study as well as the worst-case exposure conditions employed, it can be concluded that exposure of honeybee colonies to guttation fluid, excreted from neonicotinoid seed-treated crop plants, did not pose an unacceptable acute or chronic risk to honeybee colony development or survival, and does not adversely interfere with bee keeping practices. Overall, guttation water from seed treated crop plants was found not to be a significant exposure route for honeybees.",2015,,450,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
Neonicotinoid use on cereals and sugar beet is linked to continued low exposure risk in honeybees,660,JOUR,"['Woodcock, B.A.', 'Ridding, L.', 'Pereira, M.G.', 'Sleep, D.', 'Newbold, L.', 'Oliver, A.', 'Shore, R.F.', 'Bullock, J.M.', 'Heard, M.S.', 'Gweon, H.S.', 'Pywell, R.F.']","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Risks posed to bees from neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid) led in 2013 to the European Union instigating a moratorium for their use on mass-flowering crops, including oilseed rape in the UK. This restriction did allow for the continued use of these seed treatments, in particular clothianidin, on non-flowering crops like winter wheat. To determine the impacts of the moratorium, we assessed neonicotinoid concentrations pre- (2014) and post- (2015−17) moratorium in 347 honey samples collected across Great Britain. While the probability of detecting clothianidin declined immediately following the moratorium, detection rates remained constant over the following three years (mean = 0.10 ppb, maximum = 2.8 ppb). In contrast, after three years thiamethoxam residues entirely disappeared while detection of imidacloprid was infrequent but persistent over the whole period. For those hives where neonicotinoids were detected, there was no evidence that the concentrations in the honey declined over the three years following the ban. Using metabarcoding approaches, we identified plants foraged upon by honeybees during the production of honey. After the moratorium came into effect, the highest neonicotinoid residues were associated with honey produced by foraging on both oilseed rape and several wild plants found in arable field margins. Concerns about soil persistence and uptake by non-target flowering plants ultimately led to a full European Union ban in 2018. Our results suggest that before this full ban came into effect, the use of clothianidin on non-flowering crops maintained a low-level probability of encountering this neonicotinoid within honey. However, these concentrations were low and would have been unlikely to pose significant risks to honeybees. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107205,308,0.0,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,

Pollinator strips were tested for clothianidin contamination in plant tissues, and the risks to honey bees assessed. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantified clothianidin in leaf, nectar, honey, and bee bread at organic and seed-treated farms. Total glycogen, lipids, and protein from honey bee workers were quantified. The proportion of plants testing positive for clothianidin were the same between treatments. Leaf tissue and honey had similar concentrations of clothianidin between organic and seed-treated farms. Honey (mean±SE: 6.61 ± 0.88 ppb clothianidin per hive) had seven times greater concentrations than nectar collected by bees (0.94 ± 0.09 ppb). Bee bread collected from organic sites (25.8 ± 3.0 ppb) had significantly less clothianidin than those at seed treated locations (41.6 ± 2.9 ppb). Increasing concentrations of clothianidin in bee bread were correlated with decreased glycogen, lipid, and protein in workers.

Neonicotinoid-induced impairment of odour coding in the honeybee,19,JOUR,"['Andrione, M', 'Vallortigara, G', 'Antolini, R', 'Haase, A']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the possible causes of honeybee (Apis mellifera) population decline. At sublethal doses, these chemicals have been shown to negatively affect a number of behaviours, including performance of olfactory learning and memory, due to their interference with acetylcholine signalling in the mushroom bodies. Here we provide evidence that neonicotinoids can affect odour coding upstream of the mushroom bodies, in the first odour processing centres of the honeybee brain, i.e. the antennal lobes (ALs). In particular, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid, the most common neonicotinoid, in the AL glomeruli via in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with pulsed odour stimulation. Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016,10.1038/srep38110,6,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,
Neonicotinoids and Optimal Foraging Theory,543,JOUR,"['Pyke, G.H.']",Environmental Advances,"Determination of how neonicotinoid ingestion affects the foraging behaviour of flower-visiting animals, and using Optimal Foraging Theory to assess the nature and extent of consequent changes to foraging efficiency, provide a novel approach for understanding how neonic ingestion affects the cognitive abilities of these animals, and their ultimate reproductive success. Neonicotinoids (neonics for short) are used worldwide as insecticides to protect agricultural crops, but may be ingested by non-target flower-visiting animals, such as bees, with negative impacts on their cognitive abilities and consequent adverse effects on their foraging behaviour, reproduction and pollination services. Optimal Foraging Theory may help to understand such effects as it hypothesises that nectar-feeding animals, including bees, will adopt foraging behaviour that maximises net rate of energy intake. Simple models of foraging movements exist but require further development to be useful in this regard. Observed movement patterns could then be compared with predicted patterns, derived from such models, and compared between neonicotinoid-affected and control individuals, with the expectation that control individuals will forage optimally, while neonicotinoid-affected individuals will not exhibit such behaviour and will exhibit reduced foraging success. However, there has been little attempt to develop and test predictions for cognitive foragers, like bees, that are moving between flowers or flower clusters, potentially limiting our ability to manage neonic-use to control agricultural pests. Addressing this gap should lead to enhanced knowledge and understanding of the impacts of neonics on non-target animals, along with other possible flow-on environmental impacts, including possible reductions in pollinator abundance and hence the harvest yields of crops requiring pollination, and could lead to refinements in policy and procedure for future use of neonics to control agricultural pests. The same issues apply to other insecticides and to interactions amongst insecticides. © 2021 The Author",2022,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100161,7,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

Neonicotinoids override a parasite exposure impact onhibernation success of a key bumblebee pollinator,269,JOUR,"['Fauser, A', 'Sandrock, C', 'Neumann, P', 'Sadd, B']",ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,"1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation.

Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.",2017,10.1111/een.12385,42,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
New risk assessment approach for systemic insecticides: The case of honey bees and imidacloprid (Gaucho),1003,JOUR,"['Halm, M.-P.', 'Rortais, A.', 'Arnold, G.', 'Taséi, J.N.', 'Rault, S.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"The procedure to assess the risk posed by systemic insecticides to honey bees follows the European Directives and depends on the determination of the Hazard Quotient (HQ), though this parameter is not adapted to these molecules. This paper describes a new approach to assess more specifically the risk posed by systemic insecticides to honey bees with the example of imidacloprid (Gaucho). This approach is based on the new and existing chemical substances Directive in which levels of exposure (PEC, Predicted Exposure Concentration) and toxicity (PNEC, Predicted No Effect Concentration) are compared. PECs are determined for different categories of honey bees in relation to the amounts of contaminated pollen and nectar they might consume. PNECs are calculated from data on acute, chronic, and sublethal toxicities of imidacloprid to honey bees, to which selected assessment factors are applied. Results highlight a risk for all categories of honey bees, in particular for hive bees. These data are discussed in the light of field observations made on honey bee mortalities and disappearances. New perspectives are given to better determine the risk posed by systemic insecticides to honey bees. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",2006,10.1021/es051392i,40,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,
No effect of dual exposure to sulfoxaflor and a trypanosome parasite on bumblebee olfactory learning,31,JOUR,"['Vaughan, OP', 'Straw, EA', 'Linguadoca, A', 'Brown, MJF']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Bees are important pollinators in wild and agricultural ecosystems, and understanding the factors driving their global declines is key to maintaining these pollination services. Learning, which has been a focus of previous ecotoxicological studies in bees, may play a key role in driving colony fitness. Here we move beyond the standard single-stressor approach to ask how multiple stressors, an agrochemical (sulfoxaflor, a relatively new insecticide) and a parasite (Crithidia bombi, a prevalent gut parasite of bumblebees), impact learning in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We developed a modified version of the classic proboscis extension reflex assay to assess the combined effects of acute oral sulfoxaflor exposure and infection by C. bombi on olfactory learning of bumblebee workers. We found no evidence that either sulfoxaflor, C. bombi, or their combination had any significant effect on bumblebee olfactory learning, despite their known negative impacts on other aspects of bumblebee health. This suggests that losses in cognitive ability, as measured here, are unlikely to explain the impacts of sulfoxaflor and its interactions with other stressors on bumblebees. Our novel methodology provides a model system within which to test interactive effects of other key stressors on bee health.",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-12714-3,12,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,

Furthermore, chronic and acute exposure risk and risk ranking for humans eating honey were investigated, and risks to bees were also considered. The results revealed that 40.8% of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoids tested. Honeys from commercial crops were found to be more frequently contaminated with neonicotinoids than those from noncommercial crops. Honey samples from Apis mellifera were more frequently contaminated than those from Apis cerana.

Pesticide residue profiles in bee bread and pollen samples and the survival of honeybee colonies—a case study from Luxembourg,805,JOUR,"['Beyer, M.', 'Lenouvel, A.', 'Guignard, C.', 'Eickermann, M.', 'Clermont, A.', 'Kraus, F.', 'Hoffmann, L.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Pesticide residues (112 compounds) were quantified by GC-MS/MS or LC-MS/MS in 85 bee bread samples and 154 pollen samples obtained from five apiaries each with three or four colonies (genotype Buckfast) in Luxembourg over the period 2011–2013. Thiacloprid, chlorfenvinphos, tebuconazole, and methiocarb were found most frequently in bee bread while thiacloprid, permethrin-cis, and permethrin-trans were detected most frequently in the pollen samples. Three neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) that were restricted by an EU regulation in 2013 after our sampling campaign was finished were each found in less than 8% of the pollen or bee bread samples. The maximum concentrations of thiacloprid, metazachlor, and methiocarb measured in the pollen collected by a group of honeybee colonies (n = 5) without survivors within the 3-year period of observation were 86.20 ± 10.74 ng/g, 2.80 ± 1.26 ng/g, and below the limit of quantification, respectively. The maximum concentrations of the same compounds measured in the pollen collected by a group of honeybee colonies with significantly (P = 0.02) more survivors (7 out of 9) than expected, if the survivors had been distributed randomly among the groups of colonies, were 11.98 ± 2.28 ng/g, 0.44 ± 0.29 ng/g, and 8.49 ± 4.13 ng/g, respectively. No honeybee colony that gathered pollen containing more than 23 ng/g thiacloprid survived the 3-year project period.

Pesticide residues and bees - A risk assessment,942,JOUR,"['Sanchez-Bayo, F.', 'Goka, K.']",PLoS ONE,"Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees. © 2014 Sanchez-Bayo, Goka.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0094482,9,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,
Pesticide risk during commercial apple pollination is greater for honeybees than other managed and wild bees,392,JOUR,"['Mueller, T.G.', 'Baert, N.', 'Muñiz, P.A.', 'Sossa, D.E.', 'Danforth, B.N.', 'McArt, S.H.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Most pesticide research has focussed on risk to managed honeybees, but other managed and wild bees are also exposed to pesticides. Critically, we know little about the magnitude and sources of risk to honeybees compared with other bees during crop pollination. To compare pesticide exposure and risk across wild and managed bees, we sampled the main bee groups present during bloom in 20 apple orchards, including managed honeybees (Apis mellifera), managed bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens), wild mining bees (Andrena spp. and Andrena [Melandrena] spp.), bumblebee foundress queens (Bombus impatiens) and eastern carpenter bees (Xylocopa virginica). We screened all bees for 92 pesticides and computed a Risk Quotient using available toxicity data (honeybee LD50s), adjusting for differences in toxicity known to scale with body mass. To gain insight into exposure origin, we compared residues in bees to those in focal orchard apple and dandelion flowers. Nearly all bee samples contained pesticides (95%), with the average contamination level ranging from 7.1 ± 2.8 parts per billion (ppb) in B. impatiens workers to 388.4 ± 146.2 ppb in Andrena. Exposure profiles were similar for all bees except A. mellifera, whose unique exposure profile included high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam. All bee groups except wild B. impatiens queens had at least one sample exceeding a US Environmental Protection Agency or European Food Safety Authority exposure level of concern. Apis mellifera experienced significantly greater risk than other bee groups, with 63% and 81% of samples exceeding an acute or chronic exposure level of concern, respectively. Risk to honeybees was driven primarily by high thiamethoxam levels not found in focal orchard flowers and likely originating outside the orchard. Synthesis and applications: We find that pesticide exposure and risk differ between honeybees and other managed and wild bees during apple pollination. Furthermore, pesticide exposure is a landscape-scale phenomenon and therefore measures to reduce exposure must consider the surroundings beyond focal farms. Limiting orchard sprays, while reducing on-farm exposures, will not protect far-foraging bees from off-farm exposures such as thiamethoxam, which we hypothesize is coming from nearby seed-treated corn fields planted during apple bloom. © 2024 The Authors.

However, if pesticides are misused and the potential exposure risk to bees based on realistic pesticide application data are still little reported. In this study, pesticide application patterns in wheat-maize rotation system, vegetable and apple producing areas, was studied by interviewing farmers in Quzhou County, the North China Plain. The pesticide use status was evaluated by the recommended and actual applied dose and risk quotient (RQ) based Bee-REX model was used to assess the exposure risks of pesticide to bees based on the collected pesticide application data. The results showed that over half (52 %) of farmers in selected sites misused pesticides and orchard owners were frequently misused pesticides. Positive correlations were found between pesticide usage performance and farmers' specialized training experience. Pesticides applied in orchards have caused higher exposure risks to bees with the mean of RQs exceed 120 and 1880 via acute contact and dietary routes, respectively. Pesticide misuse significantly elevates the exposure risk to bees that the mean RQ under misuse scenarios was 5.8 times than that of correct use. Abamectin, fipronil and neonicotinoids contributed most to the pesticide exposure risk to bees. The main findings of this study imply that more sustainable pest and pollinator management strategies, including the moratorium high-risk insecticides and providing diverse flower resources and habitats, are highly needed.

Pollinator exposure to systemic insecticides and fungicides applied in the previous fall and pre-bloom period in apple orchards,702,JOUR,"['Heller, S.', 'Joshi, N.K.', 'Chen, J.', 'Rajotte, E.G.', 'Mullin, C.', 'Biddinger, D.J.']",Environmental Pollution,"Pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service by pollinating commercially cultivated crops, but they are frequently exposed to various agricultural chemicals used for pest management. In this study, we assessed the potential exposure of pollinators to various systemic insecticides and a fungicide used in apple orchards. Residue levels were determined for the whole flower as well as pollen and nectar separately for pre-bloom applications of acetamiprid, imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and myclobutanil. Very low pesticide residue levels (2–70 parts per billion, ppb) were found in the whole flower, pollen and nectar samples compared with pesticide concentrations of 60–200 parts per million (ppm) in applied foliarly only 5 days earlier. Insecticide residues from nectar and pollen samples were below the USA EPA classification of No Observable Effect Limit (NOEL) for acute toxicity to honey bees, suggesting that a single foraging visit to flowers may not cause toxicity to bees. However, cumulative acute exposure from multiple flower visits could potentially be harmful to bees, and needs to be studied further. We also examined apple flowers for residues of several systemic insecticides that were applied for brown marmorated stink bug control late in the fall of the previous season. None of the fall sprays that contained premixed insecticide active ingredients (viz., thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin), including multiple applications of individual active ingredients (viz., dinotefuran, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor), persisted until the following spring. Based on these findings, fall applications of insecticides used for controlling invasive pests such as the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) and the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) could be considered safe to pollinator species foraging in apple orchards during the spring bloom the following season. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114589,265,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,
Pollinators and plant nurseries: How irrigation and pesticide treatment of native ornamental plants impact solitary bees,116,JOUR,"['Cecala, J.M.', 'Wilson Rankin, E.E.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"A key conservation goal in agroecosystems is to understand how management practices may affect beneficial species, such as pollinators. Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees. Our study emphasizes the impact of a nursery neonicotinoid formulation on solitary bee foraging and reproduction, while highlighting interactions between irrigation level and neonicotinoid application in containerized plants themselves.  © 2021 The Authors.",2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.1287,288,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,

Samples were collected from small plot evaluations of seed treatments and from commercial fields in agricultural production areas in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In total, 560 samples were analyzed for concentrations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and their metabolites. These induded pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g. The highest neonicotinoid concentrations were found in soil collected during early flowering from insecticide seed treatment trials.

QSAR modeling in ecotoxicological risk assessment: application to the prediction of acute contact toxicity of pesticides on bees (Apis mellifera L.),268,JOUR,"['Hamadache, M', 'Benkortbi, O', 'Hanini, S', 'Amrane, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Despite their indisputable importance around the world, the pesticides can be dangerous for a range of species of ecological importance such as honeybees (Apis mellifera L.). Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict contact acute toxicity (LD50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce. The analysis of the statistical parameters of this model and those published in the literature shows that our model is more efficient.

Quantifying exposure of wild bumblebees to mixtures of agrochemicals in agricultural and urban landscapes,175,JOUR,"['Botías, C', 'David, A', 'Hill, EM', 'Goulson, D']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantifying the impact of pesticides on learning and memory in bees,803,JOUR,"['Siviter, H.', 'Koricheva, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products. © 2018 The Authors.

Quantitative weight of evidence assessment of higher tier studies on the toxicity and risks of neonicotinoids in honeybees. 3. Clothianidin,825,JOUR,"['Solomon, K.R.', 'Stephenson, G.L.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess higher tier studies on the effects of clothianidin (CTD) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25 µg CTD/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse effect-dose (NOAED) of 7.3 ng/bee/d for all responses measured. Based on a NOAEC of 19.7 µg/kg pollen, the NOAED for honeybee larvae was 2.4 ng/bee larva/d. For exposures via dust, a no-observed-adverse effect rate of 4 g CTD/ha was used to assess relevance of exposures via deposition of dust. The overall weight of evidence suggested that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to CTD from its use as a seed treatment. For exposures via dust, dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, there were no exposures greater than the NOAED for CTD in nectar and pollen, indicating a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure was via uptake in plants. Analysis of effect studies in the field indicated a consistent lack of relevant effects, regardless of the way CTD was applied.

Thiamethoxam,820,JOUR,"['Stephenson, G.L.', 'Solomon, K.R.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess several higher-tier studies on the effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5 µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6 ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1 g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion.

The loss of pollinating insects is of particular concern because of the ecological and economic values these species provide. The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was once common in western North America, but this species has become increasingly rare through much of its range. To understand potential mechanisms driving these declines, we used Bayesian occupancy models to investigate the effects of climate and land cover from 1998 to 2020, pesticide use from 2008 to 2014, and projected expected occupancy under three future scenarios. Using 14,457 surveys across 2.8 million km2 in the western United States, we found strong negative relationships between increasing temperature and drought on occupancy and identified neonicotinoids as the pesticides of greatest negative influence across our study region. The mean predicted occupancy declined by 57% from 1998 to 2020, ranging from 15 to 83% declines across 16 ecoregions. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we found continued declines in nearly half of the ecoregions by the 2050s and mean declines of 93% under the most severe scenario across all ecoregions. This assessment underscores the tenuous future of B. occidentalis and demonstrates the scale of stressors likely contributing to rapid loss of related pollinator species throughout the globe. Scaled-up, international species-monitoring schemes and improved integra-tion of data from formal surveys and community science will substantively improve the understanding of stressors and bumble bee population trends.",2023,10.1073/pnas.2211223120,120,0.0,0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,
Relationship of Landscape Type on Neonicotinoid Insecticide Exposure Risks to Honey Bee Colonies: A Statewide Survey,767,JOUR,"['Gooley, Z.C.', 'Gooley, A.C.', 'Fell, R.D.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Neonicotinoid insecticide use has been suggested as a cause of honey bee colony decline; however, detection rates and concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticide residues in field-collected honey bees have been low. We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5 ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g). Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or beebread (all P > 0.05). Field surveys may underestimate honey bee exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticides or the risk of exposure in different landscapes because of low detection rates. Undetectably low levels of exposure or high levels of exposure that go undetected raise questions with regard to potential threats to honey bees and other pollinators. © The Author(s) 2018.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this context, the use of insecticides with lower residuals and less harmful effects to bees is fundamental. Thus, the objective of the current work was to evaluate, in a laboratory bioassay, the residual toxicity and effect of imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and a mixture of both, when applied on canola in the field, on Africanized A. mellifera workers. Three commercial products were applied, formulated with imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid. Each plot received one of the three treatments, in the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at intervals between 14 and 0 days prior to conducting the bioassays. On the day of the bioassay, the bees were exposed to the plant material containing the treatments for a period of two hours, and were transferred to PVC cages, containing food and water. Mortality assessments were then performed at pre-established intervals until a 96 h post-exposure. Residuals on canola leaves of all tested products caused a significant reduction of honeybee worker longevity, which was less accentuated when the interval after treatment application increased.

Semi-field trials of field rates of sulfoxaflor and flonicamid against A. gossypii laboratory strain at 48 h of exposure had equipollent overall mean of mortality of 62.50 and 63.50%, respectively in season of 2020, likewise 60.50 and 62.50%, respectively in season of 2021. Lethal time values (LT1) had ranges of 51.33–32.46 days for sulfoxaflor and 49.00–39.55 days for flonicamid. Laboratory trials on foraging honeybees (∼21 days old) at 5 h of exposure showed an excellence for sulfoxaflor (5.00%) in overall mean of mortality compared to flonicamid (2.75%) in season of 2020.

Resistance and Vulnerability of Honeybee (Apis mellifera) Gut Bacteria to Commonly Used Pesticides,625,JOUR,"['Cuesta-Maté, A.', 'Renelies-Hamilton, J.', 'Kryger, P.', 'Jensen, A.B.', 'Sinotte, V.M.', 'Poulsen, M.']",Frontiers in Microbiology,"Agricultural and apicultural practices expose honeybees to a range of pesticides that have the potential to negatively affect their physiology, neurobiology, and behavior. Accumulating evidence suggests that these effects extend to the honeybee gut microbiome, which serves important functions for honeybee health. Here we test the potential effects of the pesticides thiacloprid, acetamiprid, and oxalic acid on the gut microbiota of honeybees, first in direct in vitro inhibition assays and secondly in an in vivo caged bee experiment to test if exposure leads to gut microbiota community changes. We found that thiacloprid did not inhibit the honeybee core gut bacteria in vitro, nor did it affect overall community composition or richness in vivo. Acetamiprid did also not inhibit bacterial growth in vitro, but it did affect community structure within bees. The eight bacterial genera tested showed variable levels of susceptibility to oxalic acid in vitro. In vivo, treatment with this pesticide reduced amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and affected gut microbiome composition, with most marked impact on the common crop bacteria Lactobacillus kunkeei and the genus Bombella. We conducted network analyses which captured known associations between bacterial members and illustrated the sensitivity of the microbiome to environmental stressors. Our findings point to risks of honeybee exposure to oxalic acid, which has been deemed safe for use in treatment against Varroa mites in honeybee colonies, and we advocate for more extensive assessment of the long-term effects that it may have on honeybee health. © Copyright © 2021 Cuesta-Maté, Renelies-Hamilton, Kryger, Jensen, Sinotte and Poulsen.",2021,10.3389/fmicb.2021.717990,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,

Results of a comprehensive field research programme with the systemic insecticide imidacloprid (Gaucho®),250,CONF,"['Curé, G', 'Schmidt, HW', 'Schmuck, R']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES,"Gaucho (R) is a registered trademark for plant protection products which contain the chloronicotinyl insecticide imidacloprid and which are used for seed dressing, e.g. on sunflower seed. Sunflower seed are treated with 0.7 mg a.i./grain which is equivalent to 50 a.i./ha at a planting density of 70,000 plants/ha. In 3 tunnel and 8 field tests it was examined whether this seeddressing could have an influence on honeybees at the time of flowering. Residue analysis of flowers and honeybees were performed to determine the exposure of these pollinating insects during flowering. The residue levels were then compared with effect concentrations as determined in controlled feeding experiments. In none of the 3 tunnel and 8 field tests did the seeddressing with imidacloprid affect the vitality, the foraging activity or the behaviour of the honeybees. From these results it can be reliably concluded that a seeddressing of sunflower seed with imidacloprid has no biological relevance for honeybees. Pollen and nectar of sunflower plants were analysed for the presence of imidacloprid and its relevant metabolites. No quantifiable residue levels were found at a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb. In the controlled feeding experiments under field conditions, no adverse effects were observed on bees fed with spiked sugar solution up to 20 ppb imidacloprid. At higher concentrations (50-100 ppb) honeybees only reduced transitorily the foraging activity which indicates that honeybees realise the presence of imidacloprid at these levels. When these results are compared with the residue levels found in the relevant parts of the, sunflower plants it is evident that the findings of the tunnel and field tests are fully confirmed and that no adverse effects on honeybees must be expected from the use of Gauch (R) in sunflowers.",2001,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Review on imidacloprid diffusion route and a case study: from apple orchard to the honey bee colony matrices,518,JOUR,"['Malagnini, V.', 'Fontana, P.', 'Di Prisco, G.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Zanotelli, L.', 'Power, K.', 'Colombo, R.', 'Serra, G.', 'Boi, M.', 'Angeli, G.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"Honey bees play a pivotal role in natural and rural ecosystems by providing human and animal food sources through pollination services. However, in cultivated areas, they can be exposed to the chemicals utilized for crop protection. Neonicotinoid insecticides can adversely affect honey bee colonies impairing their survival, immunity and biological activities at lethal and sublethal doses. For this reason, neonicotinoids, together with other stress factors, like pathogens (e.g. viruses and Varroa mites), climate change and food shortage, are considered one of the causes of worldwide colony losses. Nevertheless, the natural way of entry and diffusion of these pesticides in field colonies is not completely clear. Here, we wanted to fill this gap by studying the diffusion route of imidacloprid and its metabolites by analysing different matrices collected from honey bee colonies used for pollination of apple orchards, in the framework of applied Integrated Pest Management strategies. Pollen, honey bees, honey, royal jelly, bee wax and bee bread were sampled from 6 honey bee colonies placed in two different apple orchards before blooming, exposed to chemicals application and removed from the site after that. Samples were analysed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in order to detect imidacloprid, olefin im-idacloprid and 5-hydroxy imidacloprid. The results demonstrate that the primary way of entrance of imidacloprid was the pollen transported by foragers, while the main accumulation matrices were bee bread, honey and wax. These findings allow us to hypoth-esize that the accumulation of this insecticide, especially in bee bread, the main larval food, could potentially impact negatively on honey bee wellbeing at the adult stage. Moreover, our data could implement the honey bee colony simulator. © 2023, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences. All rights reserved.",2023,,76,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,
Risk assessment of pesticides on bees: evaluating risk coefficients for assessing acute and chronic toxicity,127,CONF,"['Simon-Delso, N', 'Kievits, J', 'Lortsch, JA', 'Mouret, C']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES: 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE ICP-PR BEE PROTECTION GROUP,"Background: Risk coefficients are the key in the way how a pesticide active substances or formulated products will go through the risk assessment scheme dichotomy. Defining them is thus one of the main challenges of a risk assessment scheme design. In the light of the scientific publications on the subject, the existing risk coefficients and methodologies used for the toxicity evaluation under international guidelines result questionable. Results: LD50 values have shown to be variable. Prolonged effects following single contact can sometimes be observed when measuring the acute toxicity. The trigger value (10) of the risk coefficient results as inadequate. The toxicity derived from the exposure to substances continuously available for bees at sub-lethal doses needs to be evaluated separately, given the wide differences between acute and chronic lethal effects of pesticides. Conclusions: The observation period of the mortality tests should be lengthened as long as mortality increases, and while control mortality remains acceptable. Whenever active substances can pollute bees' food sources, first tier tests should include laboratory tests: (1) on adult bees with: (a) acute toxicity tests; (b) chronic toxicity tests; (c) behavioural tests; and (2) larvae toxicity tests. Consequently, the decision to run higher tier tests should depend on four different risk coefficients.",2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.008,437,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,

Such effects can be direct effects from insecticide exposure, but neonicotinoids can affect plant physiology, and effects could therefore also be indirectly mediated by changes in plant phenology, attractiveness and nutritional value. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we tested if seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affected oilseed rape’s production of flower resources for bees and the content of the secondary plant products glucosinolates that provide defense against herbivores. Additionally, we tested if seed treatment affected the attractiveness of oilseed rape to flower visiting bumblebees, using outdoor mesocosms. Flowers and leaves of clothianidin-treated plants had different profiles of glucosinolates compared with untreated plants. Bumblebees in mesocosms foraged slightly more on untreated plants. Neither flower timing, flower size nor the production of pollen and nectar differed between treatments, and therefore cannot explain any preference for untreated oilseed rape. We instead propose that this small but significant preference for untreated plants was related to the altered glucosinolate profile caused by clothianidin. Thereby, this study contributes to the understanding of the complex relationships between neonicotinoid-treated crops and pollinator foraging choices, by suggesting a potential mechanistic link by which insecticide treatment can affect insect behavior. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02720-0,32,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,
Seed-coating of rapeseed (Brassica napus) with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affects behaviour of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and pollination of strawberry flowers (Fragaria × ananassa),563,JOUR,"['Herbertsson, L.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Blasi, M.', 'Rundlöf, M.', 'Smith, H.G.']",PLoS ONE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides applied to flowering crops can have negative impacts on bees, with implications for crop pollination. To assess if exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin via a treated crop (rapeseed) affected bee behaviour, pollination performance (to strawberry), and bee reproduction, we provided each of 12 outdoor cages with rapeseed (autumn-sown plants complemented with a few spring-sown plants to extend the flowering period) grown from either clothianidin-treated or untreated (control) seeds, together with strawberry plants and a small population of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). We expected clothianidin to reduce bee foraging activity, resulting in impaired strawberry pollination and bee reproduction. During the early stage of the experiment, we observed no difference between treatments in the length of entire foraging trips, or the combined number of rapeseed and strawberry flowers that the bees visited during these trips. During the later stage of the experiment, we instead determined the time a female took to visit 10 rapeseed flowers, as a proxy for foraging performance. We found that they were 10% slower in clothianidin cages. Strawberries weighed less in clothianidin cages, suggesting reduced pollination performance, but we were unable to relate this to reduced foraging activity, because the strawberry flowers received equally many visits in the two treatments. Clothianidin-exposed females sealed their nests less often, but offspring number, sex ratio and weight were similar between treatments. Observed effects on bee behaviour appeared by the end of the experiment, possibly because of accumulated effects of exposure, reduced bee longevity, or higher sensitivity of the protocols we used during the later phase of the experiment. Although the lack of a mechanistic explanation calls for interpreting the results with cautiousness, the lower strawberry weight in clothianidin cages highlights the importance of understanding complex effects of plant protection products, which could have wider consequences than those on directly exposed organisms.  © 2022 Herbertsson et al.

In laboratory studies with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) insects either dosed topically or fed sucrose solutions containing spinosad were also adversely affected. When tested in higher tier studies (extended laboratory or semi-field), spinosad was seen to be highly selective to many important beneficial species. Spinosad when used according to good agricultural/horticultural practice, has been shown to be compatible with predatory mites (T.pyri, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius californicus), predatory heteroptera (Orius insidiosus, O. laevigatus and Macrolophus caliginosus), coccinellidae (Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septempunctata) and neuroptera (Chrysoperla cornea and C. rufibularis). Parasitic hymenoptera are particularly sensitive to spinosad. However, toxic effects are short lived due to the low persistence of spinosad. This means that species such as A. colemani can be soon introduced to a glasshouse after application (1-2 weeks). Semi-field studies with bumble bees have also been conducted. Spinosad was applied when bees were not flying. Bees were allowed to forage on the treated plants when spray deposits had dried. The findings from these studies indicated that, when used in this way, spinosad was completely safe to foraging worker bees.

Spinosad toxicity to pollinators and associated risk,1020,JOUR,"['Mayes, M.A.', 'Thompson, G.D.', 'Husband, B.', 'Miles, M.M.']",Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Spinosad is a natural insecticide derived from an actinomycete bacterium species, Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao 1990), that displays the efficacy of a synthetic insecticide. It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",2003,10.1007/0-387-21731-2_2,179,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one active ingredient was found in 72.2% of the 79 dead honey bee samples, with the most abundant (59.4%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to the class of neonicotinoids (41.8%), followed by fungicides (40.6%). Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples except one. 71 and 37% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples, respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (>107). This work emphasizes the possible relationship between spring mortality in honey bees and pesticide treatments.

Sub-lethal doses of clothianidin inhibit the conditioning and biosensory abilities of the western honeybee apis mellifera,741,JOUR,"['Bartling, M.T.', 'Vilcinskas, A.', 'Lee, K.-Z.']",Insects,"Insects play an important role in the stability of ecosystems by fulfilling key functions such as pollination and nutrient cycling, as well as acting as prey for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The global decline of insects is therefore a cause for concern, and the role of chemical pesticides must be examined carefully. The lethal effects of insecticides are well understood, but sub-lethal concentrations have not been studied in sufficient detail. We therefore used the western honeybee Apis mellifera as a model to test the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin on the movement, biosensory abilities and odor-dependent conditioning of insects, titrating from lethal to sub-lethal doses. Bees treated with sub-lethal doses showed no significant movement impairment compared to untreated control bees, but their ability to react to an aversive stimulus was inhibited. These results show that clothianidin is not only highly toxic to honeybees, but can, at lower doses, also disrupt the biosensory capabilities of survivors, probably reducing fitness at the individual level. In our study, sub-lethal doses of clothianidin altered the biosensory abilities of the honeybee; possible consequences at the colony level are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,10.3390/insects10100340,10,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

Two doses were used: D1=10 mu g PLL kg-l in syrup and 6 mu g AI kg(-1) in pollen; D2 was 2.5 times higher in syrup and 2.7 higher in pollen. During 85 days 27, 30 and 29 micro-colonies were reared for control, D1 and D2 treatments respectively. Food consumption was not affected by either dose. During the 5-day pre-oviposition period the mean insecticide intake was 4.8 ng per day per worker in treatment D2. Both doses slightly but significantly affected worker survival rate by 10% during the first month, without any dose-effect relationship. Brood production was significantly reduced in D1 treatment and larval ejection by workers was significantly lower in D1 and D2 than in control. No significant effect of D1 and D2 treatments on the duration of larval development was revealed. No residue could be detected in workers still alive after 85 days. It was concluded that the survival rate and reproductive capacity of B terrestris was not likely to be affected by prolonged ingestion of nectar produced by sunflower after seed-dressing treatment with imidacloprid (Gaucho), since honey or pollen collected by honeybees foraging treated sunflower never revealed concentrations of imidacloprid higher than 10 mu g kg(-1).

"Sublethal acetamiprid exposure induces immunity, suppresses pathways linked to juvenile hormone synthesis in queens and affects cycle-related signaling in emerging bees",385,JOUR,"['Erban, T.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Sopko, B.']",Environmental Pollution,"Acetamiprid is the only neonicotinoid registered in the European Union because the risks of neonicotinoids to honey bees and other pollinators are strictly regulated. Herein, we orally exposed honey bee colonies to sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid (20 μg/L) under isolated conditions. After one month of continuous exposure, the emerging bees and queens were collected and analyzed via high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics using a data-independent acquisition strategy. Six and 34 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the emerging bees and queens, respectively. Mrjp3 was the only DEP found in both sample types/castes, and its opposite regulation illustrated a differential response. The DEPs in the emerging bees (H/ACA RNP, Rap1GAP, Mrjp3, and JHE) suggested that sublethal exposure to acetamiprid affected cell cycle-related signaling, which may affect the life history of workers in the colony. The DEPs with increased levels in queens, such as Mrjps 1–4 and 6–7, hymenoptaecin, and apidaecin 22, indicated an activated immune response. Additionally, the level of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the mevalonate pathway and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in queens. The impaired utilization of juvenile hormone in queens supported the identification of additional DEPs. Furthermore, the proteome changes suggested the existence of increased neonicotinoid detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and increased amino acid metabolism. The results suggest that the continuous exposure of bee colonies to acetamiprid at low doses (nanograms per gram in feed) may pose a threat to the colonies. The different exposure routes and durations for the emerging bees and queens in our experiment must be considered, i.e., the emerging bees were exposed as larvae via feeding royal jelly and beebread provided by workers (nurse bees), whereas the queens were fed royal jelly throughout the experiment. The biological consequences of the proteomic changes resulting from sublethal/chronic exposure require future determination. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123901,349,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,

In laboratory experiments, we tested whether the stingless bee Tetragonula hockingsi avoids insecticide in sucrose solutions and how T. hockingsi responds to insecticide and heat stress combined. We found that T. hockingsi neither preferred nor avoided sucrose solutions with either low (2.5 × 10 -4 ng μl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 × 10 -4 ng μl -1 fipronil) or high (2.5 × 10 -3 ng μl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 × 10 -3 ng μl -1 fipronil) insecticide concentrations when offered alongside sucrose without insecticide. In our combined stress experiment, the smallest dose of imidacloprid (7.5 × 10 -4 ng) did not significantly affect thermal tolerance (CT max). However, CT max significantly reduced by 0.8°C (±0.16 SE) and by 0.5°C (±0.16 SE) when bees were fed as little as 7.5 × 10 -3 ng of imidacloprid or 3.0 × 10 -4 ng of fipronil, respectively, and as much as 1.5°C (±0.16 SE) and 1.2°C (±0.16 SE) when bees were fed 7.5 × 10 -2 ng of imidacloprid or 3.0 × 10 -2 ng of fipronil, respectively.

Fruits cannot be grown commercially without the use of crop protection agents, either from organic or chemical origin. The use of products with toxic effects is banned during flowering, and precise pre-flowering intervals have to be respected in Good Agricultural Practice. Bee pollination is essential for fruit crops to guarantee maximal fruit quality (shape and size) and quantity (yield weight). Fruit growers in Belgium depend mostly on non-commercial beekeepers to provide sufficient colonies for adequate pollination. Under optimal circumstances, beekeepers and fruit growers have mutual benefits from this cooperation as both honey and fruit yield increase. In those European countries with a monitoring scheme, acute bee poisoning incidents have decreased considerably and hardly cause problems at present. In recent years, some concerns arose around sublethal effects (i.e., behavioural changes) of chemical crop protection on bees, especially with regard to increased winter mortality. Even though short-term effects can indeed be induced in individually exposed bees, studies that exposed complete colonies did not reveal any long-term consequences at colony level. However, from the fruit growers' viewpoint, potential short-term effects on foraging behaviour are relevant as they can bear on pollination efficacy.",2008,,73,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,
Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure attenuates the effects of electromagnetic fields on honey bee flight and learning,170,JOUR,"['Shepherd, S.', 'Lima, M.A.P.', 'Oliveira, E.E.', 'Sharkh, S.M.', 'Aonuma, H.', 'Jackson, C.W.', 'Newland, P.L.']",Environmental Advances,"Many environmental stressors are currently implicated in the decline of flying insects in general, and important pollinator species such as the honey bee. Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. © 2021",2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
Sublethal pesticide exposure induces larval removal behavior in honeybees through chemical cues,320,JOUR,"['Schuehly, W', 'Riessberger-Gallé, U', 'López, JH']",ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"We were intrigued by reported observations of reduced brood production and a high number of empty brood cells in bee colonies exposed to sublethal pesticide doses, which could suggest an active removal of larvae. Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies. Larvae that had been fed either the pesticide or LPS were removed at a significantly higher rate than control larvae. Our results demonstrate that larvae exposed to clothianidin possess altered CHC profiles, are detected in the colony by nurse bees via chemical cues and are actively removed.",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113020,228,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,
Sugar content of diet does not buffer against chronic oral imidacloprid exposure in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),703,JOUR,"['Cecala, J.M.', 'Baronia, D.A.', 'Wilson Rankin, E.E.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Bees are economically critical pollinators, but are declining broadly due to several stressors, including nontarget exposure to insecticides and deficiencies in nutrition. Understanding the simultaneous impact of stressors, particularly interactions between them, is critical to effectively conserving bees. Although behavioral effects of pesticides like neonicotinoids have received some attention in solitary bees, our understanding of how they are modulated by diet quality is limited. Furthermore, scarce data exist on what concentrations of orally ingested neonicotinoids elicit mortality in solitary bees. In a controlled exposure laboratory experiment, we investigated how diet quality, as sugar concentration, and chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid affect adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius). We provided individuals ad libitum with either 20 or 50% (m/m) sucrose syrups containing either 0, 30, or 300 ppb imidacloprid (measuring 0, 27, and 209 ppb via an ELISA assay). Over 5 wk, we tracked behavior and survivorship of individuals. Imidacloprid decreased survivorship in a dose-dependent fashion, but sucrose content did not affect survivorship, even in bees not fed imidacloprid. In the high imidacloprid treatment, 45% of bees were observed in a motionless supine position while still alive, with this effect appearing to be buffered against by the higher sucrose diet. Our results suggest that diets higher in sugar concentration may prevent an intermediate stage of poisoning, but do not ultimately extend longevity. In devising risk assessments for bees, it is important to consider that interactions between stressors may occur in the stages leading up to death even if survivorship is unaffected. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Supplemental carbohydrates influence abiotic stress resistance in honey bees,808,JOUR,"['Mogren, C.L.', 'Margotta, J.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"During periods of pollen and nectar dearth, beekeepers may provide supplemental foods in the form of sucrose (SS), high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or artificial pollen. However, these lack micronutrients present in nectar and honey, and thus may nutritionally stress colonies. Given the many stressors faced by honey bees in the environment, we evaluated how honey bees fed supplemental carbohydrates responded in combination with heat (45 °C), cold (4 °C), or imidacloprid (0.48 ng/ml) exposure. Bees were fed either honey, SS, HFCS, or HFCS + pollen and then exposed to abiotic stress treatments in the lab. Hive bee mortality was not affected by heat or cold stress, but mortality was greater for bees fed SS in imidacloprid treatments. Levels of stress proteins (superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein (HSP70), and potentially esterase) were quantified to determine sublethal stress. SOD levels were reduced in SS and HFCS treatments, indicating these diets impaired a response to oxidative stress, particularly at 45 °C. HSP70 levels were higher in the imidacloprid treatment, with no differences between control and temperature treatments. Diet interacted significantly with stress treatment with generally negative responses to HFCS. There was no effect of diet on esterase levels, though activity was much lower at 4 °C. In semifield trials, colonies with newly emerged bees fed SS experienced higher rates of worker mortality. In cage and field trials, bees consumed significantly more honey and HFCS + P than SS and HFCS. Together, these results suggest that supplemental carbohydrates contribute to sublethal stress, and natural food sources are preferred. © 2018, © 2018 International Bee Research Association.",2018,10.1080/00218839.2018.1494912,57,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,

This study aimed to isolate, identify, and investigate the potential of honeybee gut bacterial strains in mitigating the detrimental effects of insecticides on honeybees and extending their lifespan. The efficacy of seven honeybee gut bacterial strains in reducing insecticide toxicity was evaluated. Through the identification of honeybee gut bacterial isolates using 16s rRNA, seven strains were identified, namely Priestia endophytica, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Peribacillus frigoritolerans, B. subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus tequilensis. The experimental results revealed that bees treated with these gut bacteria significantly reduced oxidative stress markers and detoxification enzyme levels compared to untreated bees. Moreover, the treated bees demonstrated enhanced immune responses. The bees treated with deltamethrin + intestinal bacteria showed an increase in bees’ lifespan to 6.33 days compared to a lifespan of 4 days with deltamethrin only. Similarly, bees treated with acetamiprid intestinal bacteria had further extended to 10.33 days compared to a lifespan of 7.67 days with acetamiprid. These findings suggest that using honeybee gut bacterial strains may serve as a sustainable strategy to mitigate the harmful impacts of insecticides on honeybees, thereby promoting their overall health and contributing to the preservation of pollination services and apiculture.

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,
The Response of the Honey Bee Gut Microbiota to Nosema ceranae Is Modulated by the Probiotic Pediococcus acidilactici and the Neonicotinoid Thiamethoxam,418,JOUR,"['Sbaghdi, T.', 'Garneau, J.R.', 'Yersin, S.', 'Chaucheyras-Durand, F.', 'Bocquet, M.', 'Moné, A.', 'El Alaoui, H.', 'Bulet, P.', 'Blot, N.', 'Delbac, F.']",Microorganisms,"The honey bee Apis mellifera is exposed to a variety of biotic and abiotic stressors, such as the highly prevalent microsporidian parasite Nosema (Vairimorpha) ceranae and neonicotinoid insecticides. Both can affect honey bee physiology and microbial gut communities, eventually reducing its lifespan. They can also have a combined effect on the insect’s survival. The use of bacterial probiotics has been proposed to improve honey bee health, but their beneficial effect remains an open question. In the present study, western honey bees were experimentally infected with N. ceranae spores, chronically exposed to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, and/or supplied daily with the homofermentative bacterium Pediococcus acidilactici MA18/5M thought to improve the honey bees’ tolerance to the parasite. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowed the response of the gut microbiota to be investigated with a taxonomic resolution at the species level. All treatments induced significant changes in honey bee gut bacterial communities. Nosema ceranae infection increased the abundance of Proteus mirabilis, Frischella perrara, and Gilliamella apicola and reduced the abundance of Bifidobacterium asteroides, Fructobacillus fructosus, and Lactobacillus spp. Supplementation with P. acidilactici overturned some of these alterations, bringing back the abundance of some altered species close to the relative abundance found in the controls. Surprisingly, the exposure to thiamethoxam also restored the relative abundance of some species modulated by N. ceranae. This study shows that stressors and probiotics may have an antagonistic impact on honey bee gut bacterial communities and that P. acidilactici may have a protective effect against the dysbiosis induced by an infection with N. ceranae. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,10.3390/microorganisms12010192,12,,0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,
The combined effects of varroa destructor parasitism and exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee (Apis mellifera l.) memory and gene expression,683,JOUR,"['Morfin, N.', 'Goodwin, P.H.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",Biology,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) are exposed biotic and abiotic stressors but little is known about their combined effect and impact on neural processes such as learning and memory, which could affect behaviours that are important for individual and colony survival. This study measured memory with the proboscis extension response (PER) assay as well as the expression of neural genes in bees chronically exposed to three different sublethal doses of the insecticide clothianidin and/or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The proportion of bees that positively responded to PER at 24 and 48 h post-training (hpt) was significantly reduced when exposed to clothianidin. V. destructor parasitism reduced the proportion of bees that responded to PER at 48 hpt. Combined effects between the lowest clothianidin dose and V. destructor for the proportion of bees that responded to PER were found at 24 hpt. Clothianidin, V. destructor and their combination differentially affected the expression of the neural-related genes, AmNrx-1 (neurexin), AmNlg-1 (neuroligin), and AmAChE-2 (acetylcholinesterase). Different doses of clothianidin down-regulated or up-regulated the genes, whereas V. destructor tended to have a down-regulatory effect. It appears that clothianidin and V. destructor affected neural processes in honey bees through different mechanisms. © 2020 by the authors.

How these compounds directly influence bee survival and indirectly affect bee health via the gut microbiome is largely unknown. As toxicants in floral nectar and pollen take many forms, we explored the genomes of bee-associated microbes for their potential to detoxify cadmium, copper, selenate, the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid, and hydrogen peroxide-which have all been identified in floral nectar and pollen. We then exposed Bombus impatiens workers to varying concentrations of these chemicals via their diet and assayed direct effects on bee survival. Using field-realistic doses, we further explored the indirect effects on bee microbiomes. We found multiple putative genes in core gut microbes that may aid in detoxifying harmful chemicals. We also found that while the chemicals are largely toxic at levels within and above field-realistic concentrations, the field-realistic concentrations-except for imidacloprid-altered the composition of the bee microbiome, potentially causing gut dysbiosis. Overall, our study shows that chemicals found in floral nectar and pollen can cause bee mortality, and likely have indirect, deleterious effects on bee health via their influence on the bee microbiome.",2020,10.1098/rspb.2020.0980,287,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,
The effect of dietary neonicotinoid pesticides on non-flight thermogenesis in worker bumble bees (Bombus terrestris),845,JOUR,"['Potts, R.', 'Clarke, R.M.', 'Oldfield, S.E.', 'Wood, L.K.', 'Hempel de Ibarra, N.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"For bumble bees (genus Bombus), the capacity for non-flight thermogenesis is essential for two fundamental processes undertaken by adult workers, namely recovery from torpor after chilling and brood incubation. Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose–response relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,

The aim of this task was to investigate incidents of overwintered colonies’ death with regard to the potential interrelation to the exposure to pesticides. The samples of winter stores of bee bread and sugar food (honey or syrup processed by bees), beeswax and bees collected from apiaries with low and high rates of winter colony mortality were searched for acaricides used to control V. destructor and plant protection pesticides. The presence of acaricides used in apiculture has been detected in the 51% beeswax samples. The most abundant acaricide was tau-fluvalinate. The stores of bee bread and sugar food had a similar frequency of plant protection pesticide occurrence, ranging between 50–60%, but the number of active substances and their concentrations were substantially lower in sugar food samples. The most prevalent pesticides in pollen were fungicides (carbendazim and boscalid) and insecticides (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Only a few pesticides were found in the several dead honey bees. The level of pesticide contamination (frequency, concentration, toxicity) of hive products and bees originating from apiaries with both a high and low winter colony survival rates, was similar, which created a similar extent of risk.

Results of research conducted in field isolators in oilseed rape fields in the years 2012–2018 showed no acetamiprid influence either on the mortality or on the behaviour of honeybees. Deltamethrin activity differed from a lack of influence through causing mortality and a weaker condition of honeybee colonies to the destruction of the colony. This demonstrates the relative safety of acetamiprid to honeybees and the high risk of deltamethrin use. The differences in the bee colonies’ reaction to deltamethrin are probably caused by the high acute toxicity of this active ingredient, genetically dependent, variable metabolic capabilities of particular bee colonies, or coexistence of a variety of different stressors—mainly pathogens. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1007/s13592-020-00792-z,51,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Experiments using the feeding stations (Free-Choice Trials) method with honey solutions containing pesticides revealed that the repellency effect of pesticide formulations is different with some even attractive to honey bees. Experiments were held outdoors close to bee colonies and indoors in a fly-through hall in controlled conditions and commercial pesticides were used. The highest repellency in outdoors/indoors experiments was observed using the solution with formulations of pesticide Horizon 250 EW (a. c. tebuconazole)–96.5%/99% and Nurelle D (a. c. chlorpyriphos-cypermethrin) 88%/97%, and the lowest repellency was observed for solution with formulations of Plenum (a. c. pymetrozine)–19.2%/27.8%, Mospilan 20 SP (a. c. acetamiprid)–20%/23.8%.

The novel pesticide flupyradifurone (Sivanto) affects honeybee motor abilities,301,JOUR,"['Hesselbach, H', 'Scheiner, R']",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Honeybees and other pollinators are threatened by changing landscapes and pesticides resulting from intensified agriculture. In 2018 the European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the name of Sivanto was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless, flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone (830 mu mol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2 mu g/bee). These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0-1.75 mu g) continuously over 24h with food the observed effects are slighter. For comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this pesticide (4ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02028-y,28,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,

As such, the evolutionary lineages of the honey bee colonies were identified, a multiresidue analysis of xenobiotics was carried out in beebread and worker bee samples, and the Toxic Unit (TUm) was estimated for each sampled apiary. The relationship between lineages and the most prevalent pathogens (Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, trypanosomatids, Black Queen Cell Virus; and Deformed Wing Virus) was analysed with contingency tables, and the possible relationships between TUm and the prevalence of these pathogens were studied by using a factor analysis. The statistical analysis supported the associations between V. destructor and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), and between N. ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), but the association between these pathogens and trypanosomatids was not observed. TUm values varied between 5.5 × 10−6 and 3.65 × 10−1. When TUm < 3.35 × 10−4, it was mainly determined by coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and/or chlorfenvinphos. At higher values, other insecticides also contributed to TUm, although a clear predominance was not seen up to TUm ≥ 1.83 × 10−2, when it was mainly defined by acrinathrin, spinosad and/or imidacloprid. The possible cumulative effect from the joint action of xenobiotics was >10% in the 63% of the cases. The prevalence of pathogens did not appear to be influenced by the distribution of evolutionary lineages and, while the prevalence of V. destructor was not found to be determined by TUm, there was a trend towards an increasing prevalence of N. ceranae when TUm ≥ 23 10−4.

The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,34,JOUR,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

"Time-dependent effects on bumble bees of dietary exposures to farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil)",694,JOUR,"['Mulvey, J.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Farmland bees encounter insecticides in their diet when visiting the flowers of pesticide-treated crops with residues in nectar and pollen. A sustained exposure to even trace residues could be severely harmful if the ingested substance has a long biological half-life and its toxicity therefore intensifies over time, which is termed time-reinforced toxicity (TRT). Bumble bees are important farmland pollinators, but their susceptibility to TRT from insecticides has not been established previously. This study therefore investigated the potential for three farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil) to generate TRT in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) by dietary exposure in the laboratory using lethality as an endpoint under both fixed-dose and pulsed-dose regimes. RESULTS: The insecticides varied in toxic effect. Fipronil exposures produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity (days of exposure survived) and strong TRT with no evidence of clearance-based recovery. Thiamethoxam exposures also produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity, but with moderate TRT and evidence of some clearance-based recovery. Imidacloprid exposures produced a hormesis with reduced longevity only at the highest doses and an absence of TRT. CONCLUSION: Our study further confirms the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. Our findings suggest that regulatory oversight of pesticides will better safeguard bee health by testing the active ingredients of farmland agrochemicals for their capacity to produce TRT in these ecologically important nontarget organisms.

Toxicity of anthranilamides used in cucurbit cultivation on Apis mellifera,183,JOUR,"['da Costa, E.M.', 'de Barros, C.H.P.', 'Silva, K.O.', 'Mendonça, A.J.T.', 'Cardoso, T.A.L.', 'Bezerra, C.E.S.', 'Araujo, E.L.']",Comunicata Scientiae,"This study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of insecticides belonging to the chemical group Anthranilamide on Apis mellifera. Toxicity was evaluated in the two experiments, which corresponded to two exposure modes: direct spraying of the products on the bees and ingestion of a contaminated diet. The two bioassays were performed in a completely randomized design composed of eight treatments (absolute control – distilled water; positive control: Thiamethoxam at 0.03 and 0.3 g.a.i. L-1; Chlorantraniliprole: 0.015 g.a.i. L-1; Cyantraniliprole: 0.05 and 0.1 g.a.i. L-1; Chlorantraniliprole + Abamectin: 0.027+0.0108 g.a.i. L-1 and 0.045+0.018 g.a.i. L-1), with 10 replications each. Via exposure through direct spraying, the insecticide Chlorantraniliprole + Abamectin, regardless of the dose used, caused 100% bee mortality, showing a TL50 of 10.05h and 8.36h for the minimum and maximum doses, respectively. The insecticide Cyantraniliprole caused the death of 33.1% and 44.9% of the bees, respectively at the minimum and maximum doses, with a TL50 of 87.79 h for the two doses. The insecticide Chlorantraniliprole showed the lowest mortality rate, 24.7%, with a TL50 of 118.88h. Via ingestion of a contaminated diet, the insecticide Chlorantraniliprole + Abamectin caused 100% mortality and showed a TL50 of 27.83h and 24.01h at the minimum and maximum doses, respectively. The insecticide Cyantraniliprole caused the death of 67.6% and 68.1% of bees at the minimum and maximum doses, respectively, with a TL50 of 58.63 h for the two doses.

Toxicokinetics of three insecticides in the female adult solitary bee Osmia bicornis,591,JOUR,"['Mokkapati, J.S.', 'Bednarska, A.J.', 'Choczyński, M.', 'Laskowski, R.']",Environmental Pollution,"The worldwide decline of pollinators is of growing concern and has been related to the use of insecticides. Solitary bees are potentially exposed to many insecticides through contaminated pollen and/or nectar. The kinetics of these compounds in solitary bees is, however, unknown, limiting the use of these important pollinators in pesticide regulations. Here, the toxicokinetics (TK) of chlorpyrifos (as Dursban 480 EC), cypermethrin (Sherpa 100 EC), and acetamiprid (Mospilan 20 SP) was studied for the first time in Osmia bicornis females at sublethal concentrations (near LC20s). The TK of the insecticides was analysed in bees continuously exposed to insecticide-contaminated food in the uptake phase followed by feeding with clean food in the decontamination phase. The TK models differed substantially between the insecticides. Acetamiprid followed the classic one-compartment model with gradual accumulation during the uptake phase followed by depuration during the decontamination phase. Cypermethrin accumulated rapidly in the first two days and then its concentration decreased slowly. Chlorpyrifos accumulated similarly rapidly but no substantial depuration was found until the end of the experiment. Our study demonstrates that some insecticides can harm solitary bees when exposed continuously even at trace concentrations in food because of their constant accumulation leading to time-reinforced toxicity. © 2021 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118610,293,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,
"Toxicological assessments of agrochemical effects on stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini)",718,JOUR,"['Botina, L.L.', 'Bernardes, R.C.', 'Barbosa, W.F.', 'Lima, M.A.P.', 'Guedes, R.N.C.', 'Martins, G.F.']",MethodsX,"Bee pollination is crucial for ecosystem maintenance and crop production. The ubiquity of bee pollinators in agricultural landscapes frequently results in their exposure to agrochemicals, which has been associated with their decline. Stingless bees are wild pollinators restricted to the Pantropical region, and like honey bees, are suffering colony losses. However, stingless bees and honey bees do not show the same behaviors, therefore, methods used for risk assessment of honey bees cannot be utilized on stingless bees. Herein, we describe protocols to standardize methods that allow for the exploration of lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals via acute and chronic exposure of stingless bees. The in vitro rearing used for chronic exposure from the egg to the adult stage proved to be effective in obtaining relevant screenings. In addition, we performed a meta‐analysis and summarized the results of toxicological studies conducted with the protocols described. The meta-analyses indicated a reduction in survival under acute and chronic exposures to agrochemicals, and revealed that our protocols for toxicological assessments did not have publication bias for either acute or chronic exposure. These findings proved that these standardized protocols are reliable for toxicological research on stingless bee. © 2020",2020,10.1016/j.mex.2020.100906,7,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,
UHPLC-DAD method for the determination of neonicotinoid insecticides in single bees and its relevance in honeybee colony loss investigations,211,JOUR,"['Tapparo, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Soldà, L', 'Bogialli, S', 'Marton, D', 'Marzaro, M', 'Girolami, V']",ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,"In the understanding of colony loss phenomena, a worldwide crisis of honeybee colonies which has serious consequences for both apiculture and bee-pollination-dependent farm production, analytical chemistry can play an important role. For instance, rapid and accurate analytical procedures are currently required to better assess the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honeybee health. Since their introduction in agriculture, neonicotinoid insecticides have been blamed for being highly toxic to honeybees, possibly at the nanogram per bee level or lower. As a consequence, most of the analytical methods recently optimized have focused on the analysis of ultratraces of neonicotinoids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to study the effects of sublethal doses. However, recent evidences on two novel routes-seedling guttations and seed coating particulate, both associated with corn crops-that may expose honeybees to huge amounts of neonicotinoids in the field, with instantly lethal effects, suggest that selected procedures need optimizing. In the present work, a simplified ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection method for the determination of neonicotinoids in single bees has been optimized and validated. The method ensures good selectivity, good accuracy, and adequate detection limits, which make it suitable for the purpose, while maintaining its ability to evaluate exposure variability of individual bees. It has been successfully applied to the analysis of bees in free flight over an experimental sowing field, with the bees therefore being exposed to seed coating particulate released by the pneumatic drilling machine.",2013,10.1007/s00216-012-6338-3,405,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
Under review: Data requirements and method development of a new bee risk assessment scheme for plant protection product registration,72,JOUR,"['Jeker, L.', 'Grossar, D.']",Chimia,"An up-to-date ecotoxicological risk assessment of plant protection products (PPPs) depends on the constant improvement of risk assessment methods and guidelines, and a thorough evaluation of their impacts. Here, we explain how the risk assessment of PPPs with regard to bees and the authorisation of PPPs is conducted in Switzerland. We further report the design and application of a new method to study homing flights of honey bees using the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technique. The new method allowed to address the effects of sublethal doses of two neonicotinoids, thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, on the flight capacities of honey bees. Currently, this study design is under evaluation in an international ring test, in which the Swiss Bee Research centre participates. It is the first test design focussing on sublethal effects of PPPs on honey bees and a draft method will be submitted to OECD to become an official test guideline in the near future. Potential shortcomings and ideas for refinements on the RFID test design are discussed. © L. Jeker, D. Grossar",2020,10.2533/CHIMIA.2020.176,74,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,
Widespread contamination of wildflower and bee-collected pollen with complex mixtures of neonicotinoids and fungicides commonly applied to crops,897,JOUR,"['David, A.', 'Botías, C.', 'Abdul-Sada, A.', 'Nicholls, E.', 'Rotheray, E.L.', 'Hill, E.M.', 'Goulson, D.']",Environment International,"There is considerable and ongoing debate as to the harm inflicted on bees by exposure to agricultural pesticides. In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73. nanogram/gram (ng/g). It is notable that pollen collected by bumble bees in rural areas contained high levels of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (mean 18. ng/g) and thiacloprid (mean 2.9. ng/g), along with a range of fungicides, some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids. Pesticide exposure of bumble bee colonies in urban areas was much lower than in rural areas. Understanding the effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to complex mixtures of pesticides remains a major challenge. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016,10.1016/j.envint.2015.12.011,88,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,
tau-Fluvalinate and other pesticide residues in honey bees before overwintering,747,JOUR,"['Erban, T.', 'Vaclavikova, M.', 'Tomesova, D.', 'Halesova, T.', 'Hubert, J.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Pesticides have often been linked to honey bee colony losses, which occur mainly over winter. In this study, we investigated residues in nine colonies at a model agricultural research site during the period before wintering. Moreover, we applied the acaricide tau-fluvalinate to the colonies via a strip formulation. The pesticide content was determined by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in bees from brood comb initially collected in mid-September immediately prior to the start of tau-fluvalinate treatment and 30 later at the time of tau-fluvalinate strip removal. RESULTS: In addition to commonly analyzed pesticides, we detected two plant growth regulators, chlormequat and metazachlor, in the bee colonies. Whereas thiacloprid, chlormequat and acetamiprid decreased after 30 days and contributed considerably to differences between sample time points, other pesticides appeared to be rather stable. Interestingly, we identified diazinon, which has been banned in the European Union since 2007. The residues of methiocarb sulfoxide and imidacloprid-urea in the absence of their parent compounds indicate historical environmental contamination that can be identified by the detection of residues in a bee colony. tau-Fluvalinate was detected only after the 30-day treatment at an average (± SD) concentration of 1.29 ± 1.93 ng/bee, ranging from 0.06 to 7.13 ng/bee. CONCLUSION: The multidimensional behavior of pesticides in a bee colony was indicated. Although the research area is used for agriculture, the measured pesticide level was relatively low. The recorded concentrations of tau-fluvalinate should not be dangerous to bees, as the values were ∼ 200–5000-fold lower than the reported median lethal dose (LD50) values. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2019,10.1002/ps.5446,75,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,
