# Output Folder

This folder contains the primary output files generated by the two notebooks in this project. Below is a brief description of each file:

1. **`merged_dataset.csv`**  
   - Produced by **01_merge_datasets.ipynb** after merging the initial input dataset (`input_dataset.csv`) with the ASReview domain files.  
   - Contains all papers from the input dataset and any matching “included” columns from the domain-based CSVs.

2. **`cleaned_merged_dataset.csv`**  
   - Also generated in **01_merge_datasets.ipynb** after removing duplicate rows based on the paper `title`.  
   - Serves as the main consolidated dataset used in subsequent analyses.

3. **`not_included_papers.csv`**  
   - Created in **01_merge_datasets.ipynb** to list papers that were never marked as included in **any** of the reviewer domain outputs.  
   - Helps identify articles that may be out of scope or not assigned to a particular domain.

Feel free to explore these CSV files to see how the data was transformed and consolidated. They are also used by **02_review_output.ipynb** for further analyses on reviewer agreement and domain overlaps.
