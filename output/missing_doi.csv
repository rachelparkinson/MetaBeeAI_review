A semi-field study to evaluate effects of sulfoxaflor on honey bee (Apis mellifera),848,JOUR,"['Cheng, Y.', 'Bu, Y.', 'Tan, L.', 'Wu, W.', 'Li, J.', 'Zhou, J.', 'Zhai, A.', 'Shan, Z.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"A semi-field study was conducted to investigate the effect of sulfoxaflor on honey bees and the residues in matrices after being used on cucumber. A suspension of 22% sulfoxaflor concentration was applied on cucumber at full bloom, at the rates of 75 g a.i./ha and 100 g a.i./ha, both with 2 applications at 6-day interval. Colonies were introduced into the tunnels one day after the first application, then mortality and behaviour of the test bees were observed and recorded every day. Cucumber flowers were taken and analysed for sulfoxaflor residues. The second application occurred 6 days later, then, observations of mortality and behaviour were conducted for 5 days, and then the colonies were removed from the tunnels and transported back to the apiary for 14 days additional observation. Besides, general conditions of the colonies were assessed before and after exposure, at the end of the field study. After being introduced into the tunnels, the colonies stabilized after 3 days’ adaption. During the exposure period, sulfoxaflor showed lethal toxicity on bees, but the effect was less than that caused by dimethoate. After being removed from the tunnels, the mortalities of all groups fluctuated at a low level, indicating that sulfoxaflor had no long-term lethal effect on bees. During the whole exposure period, sulfoxaflor had no effect on the flight intensity of the bees. Meanwhile, sulfoxaflor had no obvious adverse effect on the strength and the condition of the test colonies. Residue analysis showed that: on the days of application, the residue of sulfoxaflor in cucumber flower was between 5.004 mg/kg and 5.832 mg/kg. After the applications, the residue of sulfoxaflor reduced gradually, until the 6th day after the first application, the residue reduced to 0.100~0.198 mg/kg, until the 5th day after the second application, the residue reduced to 0.155~0.304 mg/kg. © 2018, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

ACUTE ORAL TOXICITY OF NEONICOTINOIDS ON DIFFERENT HONEY BEE STRAINS,1029,JOUR,"['Laurino, D', 'Manino, A', 'Patetta, A', 'Ansaldi, M', 'Porporato, M']",REDIA-GIORNALE DI ZOOLOGIA,"Neonicotinoids are a class of relatively new insecticides, designed in the '80s, characterized by their excellent feedback, since they are highly systemic and with long-term persistence. These insecticides, however, show very strong toxicity to pollinating insects and in particular to the honey bee, besides causing also other effects which are often not easily identifiable, such as behavioural disturbances, orientation difficulties, and impairment of social activities. During the past few years, in many countries, alarming bee mortality rates were recorded. In some cases this was clearly due to the use of neonicotinoids either for seed dressing or crop spraying. It was therefore considered appropriate to test on three strains of Apis mellifera of Piedmontese origin and referable to A. in. ligustica in the laboratory both the acute oral toxicity of Imidacloprid, which had been, in use for many years, and Clothianidin and Thiametoxam, only more recently introduced in Italy. To reach this aim, methods developed at the Di.Va.P.R.A. and applied in several previous studies, were used. Commercial products were used throughout the tests. They were tested at the recommended concentration for field treatments. When mortality was higher in the tested bees than in the untreated ones, the active ingredients were tested at gradually decreasing concentrations so as to reach a mortality not significantly different from that found in the untreated controls. The LD(50) calculated for Clothianidin and Thiametoxam were lower than for imidacloprid; the differences between the honey bee strains for the same active ingredient were slight.",2010,,93,,0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
ATTRACTIVENESS AND TOXICITY OF IMIDACLOPRID AND DELTAMETHRIN INSECTICIDES AGAINST Tetragonula laeviceps SMITH (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini),463,JOUR,"['Mubin, N.', 'Audia, B.H.', 'Nurulalia, L.']",Journal of the International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences,"Tetragonula laeviceps is one of the bees that plays an essential role in pollinating plants. Currently, the existence of bee populations is in danger of decreasing. One of the reasons was the inappropriate use of pesticides. The pesticide groups that influence bee behavior and mortality are neonicotinoid and pyrethroid. This study sought to determine the attractiveness and toxic effect of imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and deltamethrin (pyrethroid) insecticides on T. laeviceps. The experiments were conducted on May to July 2022 at Insect Physiology and Toxicology Laboratory, Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agricultural University. The olfactory response of T. laeviceps was carried out using a Y-tube olfactometer with odor sources including imidacloprid (200 ppm), deltamethrin (12.5 ppm), mineral water and honey. Toxicity bioassays of T. laeviceps were carried out by topical, residual, and oral applications at five insecticide concentrations. Bees were more attracted to honey and water than imidacloprid 200 ppm or deltamethrin 12.5 ppm, while the attractiveness between imidacloprid 200 ppm and deltamethrin 12.5 ppm did not show a significant difference. The toxic effect of imidacloprid on T. laeviceps was greater than deltamethrin for the three different bioassays of insecticides. These two active ingredients were classified as highly toxic (LD50 <2 μg/bee) based on EPA classification. The implication of these results is the farmer should not spray the insecticide particularly imidacloprid and deltamethrin on their chili plantation during flowering stages. © 2023, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

"Acute lethal effect of the commercial formulation of the insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad y Thiocyclam hidrogenoxalate in Bombus atratus (Hymenoptera: Apidae) workers",22,JOUR,"['Jiménez, DR', 'Cure, JR']",REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,"The effect of insecticides on bees has gained great attention, however, there are few studies that explore this issue on Neotropical bees. Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25 medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50 were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively. For Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, topical and oral LD50 were 0.244 mu g/bee and 0.056 mu g/bee, respectively. For Spinosad, the oral LD50 corresponded to 0.28 mu g/bee; it was not possible to establish the LD50 for the contact route. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Index of Relative Toxicity indicated that all three active ingredients are highly toxic.

Assessment of sensitivity level of honeybee (Apis mellifera) to neonicotinoid insecticides,801,JOUR,"['Imran, M.', 'Naseem, T.', 'Iqbal, A.', 'Mahmood, K.', 'Sheikh, U.A.A.']",Asian Journal of Agriculture and Biology,"Declining population of honeybee day by day is the major threat, and this decline is due to variety of stressors. As honeybees are considered most important pollinators of our managed and wild corps, we investigated the effect of neonicotinoids; acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin on honeybees by ingestion and contact method. Finding of this study showed that among these neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiacloprid were most toxic insecticides with 100% mortality at realistic field doses by ingestion method with sugar solution as a substitute of nectar after the exposure of 3hrs. Honeybee's workers exposed with insecticides mixed pollen grains showed that imidacloprid and clothianidin were most toxic as compared to other insecticides at recommended field dose with 100% mortality and minimum mortality with 60% was observed at thiacloprid field dose after 3hrs exposure. The results of contact toxicity showed that all four insecticides were most toxic with wet filter paper with 100% mortality at recommend field dose after the exposure of 3hr, and with dry filter paper imidacloprid and thiacloprid showed 100% mortality and acetamiprid and clothianidin with 53.3% mortality after the exposure of 3hrs at field dose. Overall conclusion from the present study indicates that from these four insecticides imidacloprid was the most toxic as compared to all others on both ingestion and contact method at recommended field dose. © 2018.

Ecotoxicological QSAR Modeling of Organophosphorus and Neonicotinoid Pesticides,478,CHAP,"['Bora, A', 'Crisan, L', 'Borota, A', 'Funar-Timofei, S', 'Ilia, G']",ECOTOXICOLOGICAL QSARS,"Organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides are important agrochemicals used worldwide. The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data. The ligand-based combined with structure-based approaches remain a powerful tool in the design of new environment-friendly and less toxic organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides.",2020,,,,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Different samples of bees were fed with different concentrations of insecticides in sugar-water solution and the inhibitory effects were studied in terms of percentage inhibition in the head tissue of the honey bees. It was revealed that all the organophosphates inhibited AChE at the normal recommended concentration. Chlorpyriphos, methyl-parathion and triazophos proved to be the most potent inhibitors causing an inhibition in the range of 91 to 98% under different feeding methods. Thiodicarb inhibited the enzyme to a level where apparent signs of poisoning could be visible, whereas carbosulfan did not prove to be anticholinesterase in action.

In the present study, we investigated the effects on honey bees of clothianidin derived from maize seed-dressing (Poncho®) in laboratory (test by indirect contact) and in semi-field conditions. Despite the reduction of dust dispersion due to the application of the best available sowing techniques (pneumatic seeder equipped with deflector, improvement of seed-dressing quality) our results showed negative effects on honey bees at individual level. In semi-field study, no effect was observed at the colony level despite the high bee mortality rate for 2-3 days after dust application. However, we can expect a colony decline and low honey production if this high forager mortality rate lasts for longer than 10 days. Such a situation is possible if the sowing period lasts several days as in the Po Valley, where the landscape is characterized by extended maize cultivation. Specific methodologies to assess the effects of dust have never been included in the official guidelines for the evaluation of side-effects of plant protection products on honey bees.

The tests were carried out in vitro on caged bees. Significantly lower mortality rate was observed in intoxicated bees treated by a mixture of phenolic compounds compared with the intoxicated and the untreated bees. It resulted probably from increased detoxification abilities of bees (due to increased phenol content and antioxidant activity in bee bodies).

Effects of sublethal doses of crop protection agents on honey bee (Apis mellifera) global colony vitality and its potential link with aberrant foraging activity.,1000,JOUR,"['Beliën, T.', 'Kellers, J.', 'Heylen, K.', 'Keulemans, W.', 'Billen, J.', 'Arckens, L.', 'Huybrechts, R.', 'Gobin, B.']",Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the most economically valuable pollinators of fruit crops worldwide. Taking into account bees' contributions to other flowering agricultural crops, about one-third of our total diet comes directly or indirectly from bee-pollinated plants. However, in recent years there increasingly have been worrisome alarm sounds on serious bee mortalities and mysterious disappearance of bees from beehives. Among several environmental factors (e.g. climate and bee pathogens), stress factors arising from agricultural practices can potentially play a role in bee losses. Detailed knowledge on the effects of plant protection products is essential to improve usage with minimal risks. In order to identify potential medium- and long-term effects, we followed up various sublethal contaminated hives during the prolongation of the fruit-growing season. More specifically, a large-scale experiment was conducted in which at four distinct locations (in the Limburg region of Belgium) four different bee colonies (representing three different contaminations -imidacloprid, fenoxycarb, indoxacarb- and a non-contaminated control hive) were thoroughly monitored every 2-7 days. Our observations point towards decays of overall colony vitality for several hives a couple of weeks after treatment, as indicated by a set of carefully assessed parameters including the total amount of active and dead bees, total surface of capped brood and overall colony weight. These outcomes could be linked to subtle differences in foraging activity between distinct hives. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of potential short-term and long-term consequences of disturbed foraging ability triggered by exaggerated exposure to sublethal doses of crop protection chemicals, and its potential impact on colony health.",2009,,74,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Exposure to field-realistic concentrations of imidacloprid at different ambient temperatures disrupts non-flight metabolic rate in honey bee (Apis mellifera) foragers,728,JOUR,"['Gooley, Z.C.', 'Gooley, A.C.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"Pollinators facilitate the reproduction of the majority of the world’s plants but some of the most economically important pol linat-ing insects (Hymenoptera Apoidea) have undergone declines, possibly due to neonicotinoid agricultural pesticides. Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids can affect insects’ behavioral and physiological performance, and the detoxification of these pesticides likely affects insects’ metabolism. We measured honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) foragers’ CO2 production rates at different temperatures (25, 30, or 35 °C) after they consumed syrup dosed with a field realistic (5 µg/L) or high (20 µg/L) concentration of a neon-icotinoid insecticide (i.e. imidacloprid) for 48 hours. We found that imidacloprid exposure significantly disrupted honey bees’ non-flight metabolic rates and there was a significant interaction between imidacloprid dosage and ambient temperature. Honey bee foragers dosed with 5 µg/L imidacloprid displayed higher average metabolic rates and those dosed with 20 µg/L imidacloprid displayed similar average metabolic rates compared to the corresponding control group across all temperatures. Exposure to fi eld realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid may have a higher energetic cost for honey bees at 25 °C than at higher ambient tempera-tures. Disrupted energy costs in honey bees fed imidacloprid might be due to the thermoregulation, nerve excitation, or detoxification processes. Metabolic rate changes caused by pesticide exposure could result in less available energy for honey bees to per-form hive duties and forage, which could negatively affect colony health. © 2020, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Impairment of olfactory learning performances in the honey bee after long term ingestion of imidacloprid,1038,CONF,"['Decourtye, A', 'Le Metayer, M', 'Pottiau, H', 'Tisseur, M', 'Odoux, JF', 'Pham-Delegue, MH']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES,"Although the classical means of assessing toxicity of pesticides in honey are based on the determination of mortality in acute toxicity tests, it is also important to examine the effect of ecologically relevant sublethal exposure on various aspects of the honey bee behaviours. Methods used to study learning processes and foraging behaviour were adapted to test the sublethal effects of the insecticide molecule imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl) at both individual and colony levels under confined conditions. At the individual level, we studied the effects of long term ingestion of 4-40 ppb imidacloprid (11 days administration) on olfactory learning performances using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension on restrained bees. At the colony level, a sugar solution containing 50 ppb of imidacloprid was fed to a colony in a flight cage (14 days administration) to determine the effects (1) on the flight activity as measured with an activity counter set at the hive entrance and (2) on the olfactory discrimination performances on an artificial flower feeder. The olfactory conditioning showed that honey bees surviving the diet contaminated with imidacloprid had reduced olfactory learning performances. Only the concentration of 4 ppb induced a percentage of mortality not significantly different from the control diet after long term ingestion. In the flight cage, the administration of imidacloprid led to a decrease in the flight activity and the olfactory discrimination performances. Thus, the decrease in the learning performances induced by imidacloprid at the individual level was confirmed at the colony level. However, it would be necessary to conduct further work on the dose-reponse relationships, and on the sublethal effects of differents pesticides, before concluding about the hazard of imidacloprid on honey bees.",2001,,,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
In situ replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder,991,JOUR,"['Lu, C.', 'Warchol, K.M.', 'Callahan, R.A.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The concern of persistent loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies worldwide since 2006, a phenomenon referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), has led us to investigate the role of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in the emergence of CCD. CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.",2012,,65,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,

Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides,969,JOUR,"['Matsumoto, T.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid.",2013,,66,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

We found honey bees in both control and neonicotinoid-treated groups progressed almost identically through the summer and fall seasons and observed no acute morbidity or mortality in either group until the end of winter. Bees from six of the twelve neonicotinoid-treated colonies had abandoned their hives, and were eventually dead with symptoms resembling CCD. However, we observed a complete opposite phenomenon in the control colonies in which instead of abandonment, they were re-populated quickly with new emerging bees. Only one of the six control colonies was lost due to Nosema-like infection.

Fakulteit van de Landbouwkundige en Toegepaste Biologische Wetenschappen),"Spinosad is a novel insect control agent derived by fermentation of the Actinomycete bacterium, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood. Additional levels of safety could be achieved by avoiding situations where bees would forage primarily on aphid honey dew.",2002,,67,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed.

Oral and indirect contact trials were carried out on adult worker honey bees for each pesticide, using commercial formulations. The acute oral toxicity (AOT) LD50 and the acute indirect contact toxicity (ICT) LC50 were calculated. Mean AOT LD50 values at 24 hours (clothianidin 3.53 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 118.74 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.40 ng/honey bee), 48 hours (clothianidin 3.35 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 90.09 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.27 ng/honey bee), and 72 hours (clothianidin 3.28 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 69.68 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.16 ng/honey bee) from test start were of the same order of magnitude of those reported in the literature for all three neonicotinoids.

Sunflower seed are treated with 0.7 mg a.i./grain which is equivalent to 50 a.i./ha at a planting density of 70,000 plants/ha. In 3 tunnel and 8 field tests it was examined whether this seeddressing could have an influence on honeybees at the time of flowering. Residue analysis of flowers and honeybees were performed to determine the exposure of these pollinating insects during flowering. The residue levels were then compared with effect concentrations as determined in controlled feeding experiments. In none of the 3 tunnel and 8 field tests did the seeddressing with imidacloprid affect the vitality, the foraging activity or the behaviour of the honeybees. From these results it can be reliably concluded that a seeddressing of sunflower seed with imidacloprid has no biological relevance for honeybees. Pollen and nectar of sunflower plants were analysed for the presence of imidacloprid and its relevant metabolites. No quantifiable residue levels were found at a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb. In the controlled feeding experiments under field conditions, no adverse effects were observed on bees fed with spiked sugar solution up to 20 ppb imidacloprid. At higher concentrations (50-100 ppb) honeybees only reduced transitorily the foraging activity which indicates that honeybees realise the presence of imidacloprid at these levels.

We examined the toxicity of various insecticides for honey bees foraging on cotton in a greenhouse, including Turbine (R) 500 WG (150 g ha(-1)) (flonicamid), Actara (R) 250 WG (200 g ha(-1)) (thiamethoxam), Cartap (R) 500 SP (1500 g ha(-1)) (cartap), Talstar (R) 100 CE (1000 mL ha(-1)) (bifenthrin) and Match (R) 50 CE (1000 mL ha(-1)) (lufenuron). Applications of Talstar (R), Actara (R) and Cartap (R) were quite toxic. Talstar (R) was the most deadly, while Match CE (R) and Turbine (R) were only slightly toxic for adult honey bees. The Match CE (R) treatment mortality was similar to that of the control; thus, we classified it as innocuous for A. mellifera adults.",2009,,35,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,86.0
Spinosad - a naturally derived insect control agent with potential for use in integrated pest management systems in greenhouses,143,CONF,"['Miles, M', 'Dutton, R', 'BCPC', 'BCPC']","BCPC CONFERENCE: PESTS & DISEASES 2000, VOLS 1-3, PROCEEDINGS","When used according to good horticultural practice, spinosad was shown to be compatible with predatory mites (Typhlodromus pyri, Phytoseiultrs persimilis and Amblyseius californicus), predatory Heteroptera (Orius insidiosus, O. laevigatus and Macrolophus callginosus), Coccinellidae (Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septempunctata) and Neuroptera (Chrysoperla carnea and C. rufibularis). Parasitic Hymenoptera were sensitive to spinosad, however toxic effects were short lived due to the low persistence of spinosad. Consequently species such as Aphidius colemani and Encarsia formosa can be introduced to protected crops soon after application (1-2 weeks). Semi-field studies were also conducted on honey and bumble bees. Spinosad was applied when bees were not flying. Bees were allowed to forage on the treated plants when spray deposits had dried. The findings from these studies showed that spinosad was completely safe to foraging worker bees. No significantly adverse effects on queen or brood were observed on either species. It can be concluded that spinosad is highly selective to beneficials and pollinators making it an ideal insect control product for use within glasshouse IPM programmes.",2000,,01-Mar,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,90.0
