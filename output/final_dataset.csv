4.13 Synergistic effects between variety of insecticides and an EBI fungicide combinations on bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.),1049,CONF,"['Raimets, R', 'Mänd, M', 'Cresswell, JE']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES,"In recent year's severe decline in honey bees as well as in bumble bee populations have been observed all over the world. Pesticides have been proposed as one of the main cause of pollinators decline. Several studies show that variety of pesticides co-exist in environment and also in bee products at the same time and might therefore synergise. Fipronil, cypermethrin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid are agriculturally well known and used insecticides as well as fungicide imazalil. EBI fungicides like imazalil are functioning as detoxification inhibitor tools in insects. Thereby, the fungicide and insecticide co-occurrence might lead to synergy in bees. The cocktail-effects between insecticides and fungicides are still little studied. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of previously mentioned pesticides and their mixtures impact on bumble bee longevity and feeding rate. The bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) were fed with syrup containing different single pesticides and their combinations. Bees mortality and feeding rate was daily monitored. Here we show that 3 of these insecticides are synergising with fungicide and due that causing significant decrease in bumble bees longevity and feeding rate. The results from this experiment allows us to suppose that EBI fungicide imazalil inhibits the detoxification processes in bees and due that toxicity of insecticides increases. Although fungicides are considered as quite safe to bees when used appropriately and alone but in combination with insecticides might lead to faster individual death. Several studies have demonstrated impacts of single pesticides on bees, but yet there is a lack of data of synergistic effects. Future research should focus on synergistic effects of environmentally relevant doses of EBI fungicides and insecticides on pollinators longevity and physiology.",2018,"10.5073/jka.2018,462.052",462,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

For both reference and test site, six study locations were selected and ten bumblebee hives were placed at each location. In each site, three locations were directly adjacent to OSR fields, three locations were situated 400 m apart from the nearest OSR field. The development of colonies was monitored from the begin of OSR blossom in April until June 2014. Pollen from returning foragers was analysed for its composition and residue content. At the end of OSR blossom hives were removed from the study sites and eventually dissected assessing young queens as well as the undeveloped queen brood cells. An average of 44% of OSR pollen was found in the pollen loads of bumblebees indicating that 0513 was a major resource for the colonies. Colony development in terms of hive weight and the number of workers showed a typical course no statistically significant differences were found between the sites. Reproductive output (young queens and queen brood) cells was comparatively high and not negatively affected by the exposure to treated OSR. In summary, Elado (R)-dressed OSR did not cause any detrimental effects on the development or reproduction of bumblebee colonies.",2018,10.5073/jka.2018.462.054,462,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
A Combined LD50 for Agrochemicals and Pathogens in Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris [Hymenoptera: Apidae]),20,JOUR,"['Siviter, H', 'Matthews, AJ', 'Brown, MJF']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide in the world and can have significant sub-lethal impacts on beneficial insects, including bumblebees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wild-flowers. This has led to bans on neonicotinoid use in the EU and has resulted in repeated calls for the agrochemical regulatory process to be modified. For example, there is increasing concern about 1) the underrepresentation of wild bees, such as bumblebees, in the regulatory process, and 2) the failure to determine how agrochemicals, such as neonicotinoids, interact with other commonly occurring environmental stressors, such as parasites. Here, we modify an OECD approved lethal dose (LD50) experimental design and coexpose bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and the highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, in a fully crossed design. We found no difference in the LD50 of thiamethoxam on bumblebees that had or had not been inoculated with the parasite (Crithidia bombi). Furthermore, thiamethoxam dosage did not appear to influence the parasite intensity of surviving bumblebees, and there was no effect of either parasite or insecticide on sucrose consumption. The methodology used demonstrates how existing ring-tested experimental designs can be effectively modified to include other environmental stressors such as parasites. Moving forward, the regulatory process should implement methodologies that assess the interactions between agrochemicals and parasites on non-Apis bees and, in cases when this is not practical, should implement post-regulatory monitoring to better understand the real-world consequences of agrochemical use.",2022,10.1093/ee/nvab139,51,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
A Comparison of Pollen and Syrup Exposure Routes in Bombus impatiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Microcolonies: Implications for Pesticide Risk Assessment,564,JOUR,"['Weitekamp, C.A.', 'Koethe, R.W.', 'Lehmann, D.M.']",Environmental Entomology,"Bumble bees are important pollinators for both native plants and managed agricultural systems. Accumulating evidence has shown that pesticides, including neonicotinoids, can have a range of adverse effects on bumble bee health. Most laboratory studies that assess the effects of chronic neonicotinoid exposure on bumble bees use syrup as the delivery vehicle, rather than pollen. However, in the field, it is likely that bumble bees are exposed to neonicotinoids in both nectar (syrup) and pollen. To examine the potential for different effects based on the vehicle, we compared two studies of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in Bombus impatiens microcolonies. We examined correlations between microcolony endpoints and identified associations between the timing of colony pollen and syrup consumption and drone production. Furthermore, in line with previous results, we found that average drone weight was affected at a range of doses only when microcolonies were exposed to acetamiprid via pollen. In general, our analyses point to the importance of the treatment vehicle and suggest that critical effects on developing brood could be missed when neonicotinoid exposure occurs only through syrup.  © 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.",2022,10.1093/ee/nvac026,51,,0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
A Four-Year Field Program Investigating Long-Term Effects of Repeated Exposure of Honey Bee Colonies to Flowering Crops Treated with Thiamethoxam,963,JOUR,"['Pilling, E.', 'Campbell, P.', 'Coulson, M.', 'Ruddle, N.', 'Tornier, I.']",PLoS ONE,"Neonicotinoid residues in nectar and pollen from crop plants have been implicated as one of the potential factors causing the declines of honey bee populations. Median residues of thiamethoxam in pollen collected from honey bees after foraging on flowering seed treated maize were found to be between 1 and 7 μg/kg, median residues of the metabolite CGA322704 (clothianidin) in the pollen were between 1 and 4 μg/kg. In oilseed rape, median residues of thiamethoxam found in pollen collected from bees were between <1 and 3.5 μg/kg and in nectar from foraging bees were between 0.65 and 2.4 μg/kg. Median residues of CGA322704 in pollen and nectar in the oilseed rape trials were all below the limit of quantification (1 μg/kg). Residues in the hive were even lower in both the maize and oilseed rape trials, being at or below the level of detection of 1 μg/kg for bee bread in the hive and at or below the level of detection of 0.5 μg/kg for hive nectar, honey and royal jelly samples. The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring. We conclude that these data demonstrate there is a low risk to honey bees from systemic residues in nectar and pollen following the use of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment on oilseed rape and maize. © 2013 Pilling et al.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0077193,8,,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,
A Locomotor Deficit Induced by Sublethal Doses of Pyrethroid and Neonicotinoid Insecticides in the Honeybee Apis mellifera,149,JOUR,"['Charreton, M', 'Decourtye, A', 'Henry, M', 'Rodet, G', 'Sandoz, JC', 'Charnet, P', 'Collet, C']",PLOS ONE,"The toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture towards non-targeted organisms and especially pollinators has recently drawn the attention from a broad scientific community. Increased honeybee mortality observed worldwide certainly contributes to this interest. The potential role of several neurotoxic insecticides in triggering or potentiating honeybee mortality was considered, in particular phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, given that they are widely used and highly toxic for insects. Along with their ability to kill insects at lethal doses, they can compromise survival at sublethal doses by producing subtle deleterious effects. In this study, we compared the bee's locomotor ability, which is crucial for many tasks within the hive (e.g. cleaning brood cells, feeding larvae...), before and after an acute sublethal exposure to one insecticide belonging to the two insecticide classes, fipronil and thiamethoxam. Additionally, we examined the locomotor ability after exposure to pyrethroids, an older chemical insecticide class still widely used and known to be highly toxic to bees as well. Our study focused on young bees (day 1 after emergence) since (i) few studies are available on locomotion at this stage and (ii) in recent years, pesticides have been reported to accumulate in different hive matrices, where young bees undergo their early development. At sublethal doses (SLD48h, i.e. causing nomortality at 48h), three pyrethroids, namely cypermethrin (2.5 ng/bee), tetramethrin (70 ng/bee), tau-fluvalinate (33 ng/bee) and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (3.8 ng/bee) caused a locomotor deficit in honeybees. While the SLD48h of fipronil (a phenylpyrazole, 0.5 ng/bee) had no measurable effect on locomotion, we observed high mortality several days after exposure, an effect that was not observed with the other insecticides. Although locomotor deficits observed in the sublethal range of pyrethroids and thiamethoxam would suggest deleterious effects in the field, the case of fipronil demonstrates that toxicity evaluation requires information on multiple endpoints (e.g. long term survival) to fully address pesticides risks for honeybees. Pyrethroid-induced locomotor deficits are discussed in light of recent advances regarding their mode of action on honeybee ion channels and current structure-function studies.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0144879,10,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
A Pediococcus strain to rescue honeybees by decreasing Nosema ceranae- and pesticide-induced adverse effects,721,JOUR,"['Peghaire, E.', 'Moné, A.', 'Delbac, F.', 'Debroas, D.', 'Chaucheyras-Durand, F.', 'El Alaoui, H.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Honeybees ensure a key ecosystemic service by pollinating many agricultural crops and wild plants. However, since few decades, managed bee colonies have declined worldwide. This phenomenon is considered to be multifactorial, with a strong emphasis on both parasites and pesticides. Infection by the parasite Nosema ceranae and exposure to pesticides can contribute to adverse effects, resulting in a perturbation of the honeybee physiology. We thus hypothesized that probiotic treatment could be promising to treat or prevent these disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on N. ceranae-infected and intoxicated honeybees (by the insecticide thiamethoxam and the fungicide boscalid). For this purpose, experiments were conducted with five probiotics. Among them, Pediococcus acidilactici (PA) showed the best protective effect against the parasite and pesticides. PA significantly improved the infected honeybee lifespan as prophylactic and curative treatments (respectively 2.3 fold and 1.7 fold). Furthermore, the exposure to pesticides induced an increase of honeybee mortality compared with the control group (p < .001) that was restored by the PA treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on honeybee lifespan, the PA administration did not induce changes in the gut bacterial communities (neither in abundance or diversity). N. ceranae and the pesticides were shown to deregulate genes involved in honeybee development (vitellogenin), immunity (serine protease 40, defensin) and detoxification system (glutathione peroxidase-like 2, catalase), and these effects were corrected by the PA treatment. This study highlights the promising use of PA to protect honeybees from both pathogens and pesticides. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.11.006,163,,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

A residual film bioassay using pre-treated conical flasks and transferring the bees to the treated flasks in the field itself was easy and less time-consuming. Stingless bees survived for 12 hours in the control flasks with the bioassay method III.

The use of biopesticides, like spinosad, is preferred as an alternative method to control pests, because it is considered safer to non-target insects. In this study, we evaluated the lethal and sublethal effects of the spinosad-based formulation Tracer® on foragers of the stingless bee Plebeia lucii Moure (Apidae: Meliponini). Groups of bees were fed a pure diet (negative control) or a diet at different concentrations of spinosad. Positive control groups consisted of bees orally exposed to a diet with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Next, flight behavior, body mass, and respiration rate were evaluated in surviving bees. The results showed that bees´ survival was reduced by all concentrations of spinosad, when compared with the negative control. Bee locomotion—walking and flight—was reduced in accordance with the increase in spinosad concentrations; however, body mass and respiration rate were not altered. Our results show that the use of Tracer® in ecosystems visited by P. lucii can reduce forager bee survival and reduce their locomotion, generating a negative impact on pollination services provided by these bees. © 2020, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.",2020,10.1007/s13744-020-00766-x,49,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,
A Sublethal Concentration of Sulfoxaflor Has Minimal Impact on Buff-Tailed Bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) Locomotor Behaviour under Aversive Conditioning,489,JOUR,"['James, L.', 'Reynolds, A.M.', 'Mellor, I.R.', 'Davies, T.G.E.']",Toxics,"Pesticide exposure has been cited as a key threat to insect pollinators. Notably, a diverse range of potential sublethal effects have been reported in bee species, with a particular focus on effects due to exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, a purpose-built thermal–visual arena was used in a series of pilot experiments to assess the potential impact of approximate sublethal concentrations of the next generation sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor (5 and 50 ppb) and the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid (500 ppb) and thiamethoxam (10 ppb), on the walking trajectory, navigation and learning abilities of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris audax) when subjected to an aversive conditioning task. The results suggest that only thiamethoxam prevents forager bees from improving in key training parameters (speed and distanced travelled) within the thermal visual arena. Power law analyses further revealed that a speed–curvature power law, previously reported as being present in the walking trajectories of bumblebees, is potentially disrupted under thiamethoxam (10 ppb) exposure, but not under sulfoxaflor or thiacloprid exposure. The pilot assay described provides a novel tool with which to identify subtle sublethal pesticide impacts, and their potential causes, on forager bees, that current ecotoxicological tests are not designed to assess. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,10.3390/toxics11030279,11,,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
A Vitellogenin Antibody in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera): Characterization and Application as Potential Biomarker for Insecticide Exposure,232,JOUR,"['Christen, V.', 'Vogel, M.S.', 'Hettich, T.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The insect yolk precursor vitellogenin is a lipoglycoprotein synthesized and stored in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph. In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees.

A combination of the frequent fungicides boscalid and dimoxystrobin with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in field-realistic concentrations does not affect sucrose responsiveness and learning behavior of honeybees,495,JOUR,"['Schuhmann, A.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The increasing loss of pollinators over the last decades has become more and more evident. Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations. In addition, the honeybee seems to be quite robust when it comes to effects of plant protection products, while wild bees might be more sensitive. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114850,256,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
"A common neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, alters honey bee activity, motor functions, and movement to light",854,JOUR,"['Tosi, S.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Scientific Reports,"Honey bees provide key ecosystem services. To pollinate and to sustain the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour. However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus, TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and, potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain outdoors. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15308-6,7,,0,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

We tested the effects of acute or chronic exposure to thiamethoxam on the flight ability of foragers in flight mills. Within 1 h of consuming a single sublethal dose (1.34 ng/bee), foragers showed excitation and significantly increased flight duration (+78%) and distance (+72%). Chronic exposure significantly decreased flight duration (-54%), distance (-56%), and average velocity (-7%) after either one or two days of continuous exposure that resulted in bees ingesting field-relevant thiamethoxam doses of 1.96-2.90 ng/bee/day.

A cytochrome P450 insecticide detoxification mechanism is not conserved across the Megachilidae family of bees,167,JOUR,"['Hayward, A.', 'Hunt, B.J.', 'Haas, J.', 'Bushnell-Crowther, E.', 'Troczka, B.J.', 'Pym, A.', 'Beadle, K.', 'Field, J.', 'Nelson, D.R.', 'Nauen, R.', 'Bass, C.']",Evolutionary Applications,"Recent work has demonstrated that many bee species have specific cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) that can efficiently detoxify certain insecticides. The presence of these P450s, belonging or closely related to the CYP9Q subfamily (CYP9Q-related), is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees. However, the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, lacks CYP9Q-related P450s and is 170–2500 times more sensitive to certain insecticides than bee pollinators with these P450s. The extent to which these findings apply to other Megachilidae bee species remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four Megachile species and leveraged the data obtained, in combination with publicly available genomic data, to investigate the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae. Our analyses reveal that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-related genes. In place of these genes Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage. Functional expression of these P450s from M. rotundata reveal they lack the capacity to metabolize the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In contrast, species from the Osmiini and Dioxyini tribes of Megachilidae have CYP9Q-related P450s belonging to the CYP9BU subfamily that are able to detoxify thiacloprid. These findings provide new insight into the evolution of P450s that act as key determinants of insecticide sensitivity in bees and have important applied implications for pesticide risk assessment. © 2023 The Authors.

A deeper understanding of system interactions can explain contradictory field results on pesticide impact on honey bees,239,JOUR,"['Breda, D', 'Frizzera, D', 'Giordano, G', 'Seffin, E', 'Zanni, V', 'Annoscia, D', 'Topping, CJ', 'Blanchini, F', 'Nazzi, F']",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,"Pesticide impact on honey bees under field conditions remains elusive. Here, the authors combine a systems biology approach and laboratory experiments to show that the immune suppressive effect of the pathogen deformed wing virus can be responsible for the disparity amongst honey bee experiments. While there is widespread concern regarding the impact of pesticides on honey bees, well-replicated field experiments, to date, have failed to provide clear insights on pesticide effects. Here, we adopt a systems biology approach to gain insights into the web of interactions amongst the factors influencing honey bee health. We put the focus on the properties of the system that depend upon its architecture and not on the strength, often unknown, of each single interaction. Then we test in vivo, on caged honey bees, the predictions derived from this modelling analysis. We show that the impact of toxic compounds on honey bee health can be shaped by the concurrent stressors affecting bees. We demonstrate that the immune-suppressive capacity of the widespread pathogen of bees, deformed wing virus, can introduce a critical positive feed-back loop in the system causing bistability, i.e., two stable equilibria. Therefore, honey bees under similar initial conditions can experience different consequences when exposed to the same stressor, including prolonged survival or premature death. The latter can generate an increased vulnerability of the hive to dwindling and collapse. Our conclusions reconcile contrasting field-testing outcomes and have important implications for the application of field studies to complex systems.",2022,10.1038/s41467-022-33405-7,13,,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,
A demographic approach to evaluating the impact of stressors on bumble bee colonies,879,JOUR,"['Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecological Entomology,"1. Natural and anthropogenic stressors threaten the sustainability of bumble bees and evaluating their impact is essential to the stewardship of these valuable pollinators. Demographic modelling provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the impacts of stressors, but it has not previously been applied to bumble bees. 2. I therefore formulated a demographic model for a bumble bee colony and then quantified the impact of two stressors, pesticide exposure and spider predation, by perturbing it with their known effects. 3. By simulating a laboratory exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to dietary imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide), I tested whether the observed colony decline was explained solely by a toxic effect on the fecundity of the foundress queen. By simulating field observations of B. terricola Kirby, I tested whether predation by crab spiders reduced colony fitness sufficiently to provide an adaptive explanation for avoidance behaviours seen when bumble bees encounter spiders. 4. In B. terrestris, a dose-appropriate decrease in fecundity predicted the observed colony decline, which implicates this as a principal mechanism of toxicity. In B. terricola, doubling the rate of spider predation reduced a colony's production of new queens by 11%, which implies that spider avoidance is highly adaptive. 5. These analyses illustrate the utility of demographic modelling for quantifying the impacts of stressors on bumble bees. In the future, models of this type could be used to investigate a wider range of stressors and to produce thereby knowledge and tools useful for safeguarding bumble bees and the pollination services that they provide. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",2017,10.1111/een.12376,42,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
A field study examining the effects of exposure to neonicotinoid seed-treated corn on commercial bumble bee colonies,938,JOUR,"['Christopher Cutler, G.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.']",Ecotoxicology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to bumble bee declines in North America and Europe. This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from “conventional” seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or “organic” seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1–0.8 ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96 ± 15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127 ± 17 workers per hive). The results suggest that exposure during pollen shed to corn grown from neonicotinoid-treated shed poses low risk to B. impatiens. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1340-5,23,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,
A food-ingested sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam has harmful effects on the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris,609,JOUR,"['Miotelo, L.', 'Mendes dos Reis, A.L.', 'Rosa-Fontana, A.', 'Karina da Silva Pachú, J.', 'Malaquias, J.B.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Roat, T.C.']",Chemosphere,"In recent years, the importance of bee's biodiversity in the Neotropical region has been evidencing the relevance of including native bees in risk assessments. Therefore, the sublethal effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on the survival and morphological parameters of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris were investigated in the present study. Cells from both non-target organs (Malpighian tubules and midgut) and target organs (brain) were analyzed for morphological alterations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The findings showed that when M. scutellaris foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100 = 0.000543 ng a. i./μL), longevity was not reduced but brain function was affected, even with the non-target organs attempting to detoxify. The cellular damage in all the organs was mostly reflected in irregular nuclei shape and condensed chromatin, indicating cell death. The most frequent impairments in the Malpighian tubules were loss of microvilli, disorganization of the basal labyrinth, and cytoplasmic loss. These characteristics are related to an attempt by the cells to increase the excretion process, probably because of the high number of toxic molecules that reach the Malpighian tubules and need to be secreted. In general, damages that compromise the absorption of nutrients, excretion, memory, and learning processes, which are essential for the survival of M. scutellaris, were found. The present results also fill in gaps on how these bees respond to thiamethoxam exposure and will be useful in future risk assessments for the conservation of bee biodiversity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.132461,288,,0,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

Colonies were placed in clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields during bloom, and thereafter were moved to an apiary with no surrounding crops grown from seeds treated with neonicotinoids. Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with freeranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012-2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada.

A long-term field study on the effects of dietary exposure of clothianidin to varroosis-weakened honey bee colonies,797,JOUR,"['Siede, R.', 'Meixner, M.D.', 'Almanza, M.T.', 'Schöning, R.', 'Maus, C.', 'Büchler, R.']",Ecotoxicology,"Clothianidin is a commonly used systemic insecticide in seed treatments. Residues of clothianidin can occur in nectar and pollen as a result of within-plant-translocation. Foraging bees can collect contaminated nectar or pollen. Concerns have been brought forward that exposure to pesticide residues might affect colonies especially if they are weakened by varroosis. However, there are few scientific studies investigating such multiple-stressor scenarios in the context of the entire colony. To close this gapa field trial with 24 colonies was set up. The study design comprised four groups of six colonies each fed with uncontaminated sugar syrup ('C0'), or syrup spiked with 10 μg L−1 clothianidin ('C10'), 50 μg L−1 clothianidin ('C50') or 200 μg L−1 clothianidin ('C200'). C10 represented a residue concentration that may exceptionally occur and therefore a worst-case scenario, the higher dietary concentrations exceed and do not reflect fieldrealistic levels. A substantial load of 8 mites of Varroa destructor per ten gram bees in autumn was adjusted. The colonies were followed up for 328 days. The amount of brood and the strength of each colony were regularly assessed. Colony health, bee mortality, overwintering success, hive weights, and levels of in-hive residues were determined. Varroosis turned out to be the significant key factor for the endpoint colony strength. Clothianidin did not have a statistically significant impact on C0, C10 and C50 colonies. No statistical evidence was found for an interaction between varroosis andexposure to clothianidin. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,10.1007/s10646-018-1937-1,27,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
A method to quantify and analyze the foraging activity of honey bees: Relevance to the sublethal effects induced by systemic insecticides,223,JOUR,"['Colin, ME', 'Bonmatin, JM', 'Moineau, I', 'Gaimon, C', 'Brun, S', 'Vermandere, JP']",ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY,"The assessment of agrophannaceuticals' side effects requires more realistic simulations of field conditions than those deduced from the dose-lethality relation obtained under laboratory conditions. Because the presence of sublethal doses or concentrations may also alter the behavior of foraging insects, we attempted to devise a quantifiable and accurate protocol for evidencing various alterations in free-flying bees. Such a protocol was illustrated by testing new classes of systemic insecticides. The protocol focused on video recording to quantify the foraging activity of small colonies of honey bees confined in insect-proof tunnels. The basis of the protocol was not the colony itself but the change in each colony on a specific day and between days. First, the paradigms of attendance at a safe feeding source were established by observing 8 control colonies at different times of the season during 5 days after the necessary forager training was accomplished. Second, on three different colonies we considered the paradigms on the control day before contamination and during 4 days after the feeding source was contaminated. During the same period, one more colony was exclusively fed with safe food to serve as control. Two plant-systemic insecticides were tested at contamination levels 70 times lower than the 50% of the lethal concentration. Imidacloprid, at 6 mug/kg, clearly induced a decrease in the proportion of active bees. Fipronil, at 2 mug/kg, induced an additional decrease in attendance at the feeder. Such levels are still higher than the corresponding lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC). Our protocol, which provided intermediate conditions between field and laboratory conditions, allowed the quantification, with an enhanced level of sensitivity, of sublethal effects on foraging bees.",2004,10.1007/s00244-004-3052-y,47,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
A neonicotinoid impairs olfactory learning in Asian honey bees (Apis cerana) exposed as larvae or as adults,923,JOUR,"['Tan, K.', 'Chen, W.', 'Dong, S.', 'Liu, X.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Scientific Reports,"Xenobiotics such as the neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, are used globally, but their effects on native bee species are poorly understood. We studied the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on olfactory learning in the native honey bee species, Apis cerana, an important pollinator of agricultural and native plants throughout Asia. We provide the first evidence that imidacloprid can impair learning in A. cerana workers exposed as adults or as larvae. Adults that ingested a single imidacloprid dose as low as 0.1ng/bee had significantly reduced olfactory learning acquisition, which was 1.6-fold higher in control bees. Longer-term learning (1-17h after the last learning trial) was also impaired. Bees exposed as larvae to a total dose of 0.24ng/bee did not have reduced survival to adulthood. However, these larval-treated bees had significantly impaired olfactory learning when tested as adults: control bees exhibited up to 4.8-fold better short-term learning acquisition, though longer-term learning was not affected.

A neonicotinoid pesticide alters how nectar chemistry affects bees,562,JOUR,"['Richman, S.K.', 'Maalouf, I.M.', 'Smilanich, A.M.', 'Marquez Sanchez, D.', 'Miller, S.Z.', 'Leonard, A.S.']",Functional Ecology,"Neonicotinoid pesticides in the nectar and pollen of managed crops and wildflowers contribute to the global declines of bees. These chemicals can have detrimental effects on bees' physiology, behaviour and reproduction. Floral nectar also contains secondary chemistry with its own effects on bee health. How nectar secondary chemistry may act additively or synergistically with neonicotinoids is unknown. Here, we asked how an acute exposure to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid (IMD) affected the longevity, immune function and behaviour of bumble bee Bombus impatiens workers maintained on diets enriched with one of three nectar secondary metabolites (NSMs; the alkaloid caffeine, the terpenoid thymol or the cardiac glycoside digoxin). A factorial design allowed us to assess the potential for additive and interactive effects of each NSM and IMD combination on multiple health outcomes. Without IMD exposure, different dietary NSMs each had positive effects on life span (caffeine), immune function (digoxin) and activity levels (caffeine, thymol), although these came with trade-offs. A single sublethal IMD exposure overshadowed these NSM effects, and in two cases, an NSM-enriched diet magnified the negative effects of pesticide exposure. In summary, we show that even a single acute exposure to a pesticide has the potential to reshape interactions between pollinators and plants mediated by nectar secondary chemistry.

"A neonicotinoid pesticide impairs foraging, but not learning, in free-flying bumblebees",292,JOUR,"['Muth, F', 'Leonard, AS']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Neonicotinoids are widely-used pesticides implicated in the decline of bees, known to have sub-lethal effects on bees' foraging and colony performance. One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.",2019,10.1038/s41598-019-39701-5,9,,0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Interspecific variation in wild bee response to pesticide exposure is expected to be related to variation in their morphology, physiology, and ecology, though there are still important knowledge gaps in its understanding. Pesticide risk assessments have largely focussed on the Western honey bee sensitivity considering it protective enough for wild bees. Recently, guidelines for Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis testing have been developed but are not yet implemented at a global scale in pesticide risk assessments. Here, we developed and tested a new simplified method of pesticide exposure on wild bee species collected from the field in Belgium. Enough specimens of nine species survived in a laboratory setting and were exposed to oral and topical acute doses of a sulfoximine insecticide. Our results confirm significant variability among wild bee species. We show that Osmia cornuta is more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than B. terrestris, whereas Bombus hypnorum is less sensitive. We propose hypotheses on the mechanisms explaining interspecific variations in sensitivity to pesticides.

A new method to assess the acute toxicity toward honeybees of the abrasion particles generated from seeds coated with insecticides,160,JOUR,"['Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Girolami, V', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background Large amounts of insecticide-containing dusts produced from abrasion of the seed dressing can be released into the atmosphere during sowing operations. Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1990s for several crops, are the leading products for seed-coating treatments in many countries. Neonicotinoid containing dusts can be effectively intercepted by bees in flight over the sowing field, inducing lethal acute effects, so that restrictions in the use of the main neonicotinoids have been adopted in the European Union. This led to the consequent introduction of replacement insecticides for seed-coating, i.e. methiocarb and thiacloprid, despite the lack of information on both the toxicity and the exposure scenarios for honeybees. Results In this study, a laboratory apparatus was developed in order to quantify the toxicity of the dusts produced from the abrasion of the seed coating. This quantification is based on (i) an airstream transporting coating particles into an exposure chamber; (ii) exposure of bees to reproducible and measurable concentrations of insecticide, and (iii) direct measurement of the exposure dose on single bees. The method allowed us to perform in vivo experiments of honeybee exposure to provide toxicity data in more realistic exposure conditions. In fact, the formulation rather than the active principle alone can be tested, and the exposure is through dusts rather than a solution so that specific absorption behavior can be studied in representative environmental conditions. The method was used to quantify the acute toxicity (LD50) of dusts obtained from the abrasion of corn seeds coated with clothianidin, thiacloprid and methiocarb. Conclusions Our results show that, surprisingly, the replacement insecticide methiocarb has a toxicity (LD50 = 421-693 ng/bee) in the same order of magnitude as clothianidin (LD50 = 113-451 ng/bee) through this specific exposure route, while thiacloprid (LD50 = 16.9 center dot 10(3) ng/bee) has a significantly lower acute toxicity. Moreover, dusts containing methiocarb and clothianidin show a significant increase in toxicity when, after exposure, bees are kept under high humidity conditions. This suggests that the method here presented can be used to obtain complementary toxicity data in the risk assessment procedure for the authorization of new seed-coating insecticides or new formulations.",2020,10.1186/s12302-020-00372-z,32,,0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist affects honey bee sucrose responsiveness and decreases waggle dancing,985,JOUR,"['Eiri, D.M.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, imidacloprid, impairs memory formation in honey bees and has general effects on foraging. However, little is known about how this agonist affects two specific aspects of foraging: sucrose responsiveness (SR) and waggle dancing (which recruits nestmates). Using lab and field experiments, we tested the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on (1) bee SR with the proboscis extension response assay, and (2) free-flying foragers visiting and dancing for a sucrose feeder. Bees that ingested imidacloprid (0.21 or 2.16 ng bee -1) had higher sucrose response thresholds 1 h after treatment. Foragers that ingested imidacloprid also produced significantly fewer waggle dance circuits (10.5- and 4.5-fold fewer for 50% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively) 24 h after treatment as compared with controls. However, there was no significant effect of imidacloprid on the sucrose concentrations that foragers collected at a feeder 24 h after treatment. Thus, imidacloprid temporarily increased the minimum sucrose concentration that foragers would accept (short time scale, 1 h after treatment) and reduced waggle dancing (longer time scale, 24 h after treatment). The effect of time suggests different neurological effects of imidacloprid resulting from the parent compound and its metabolites. Waggle dancing can significantly increase colony food intake, and thus a sublethal dose (0.21 ng bee -1, 24 p.p.b.) of this commonly used pesticide may impair colony fitness. © 2012 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",2012,10.1242/jeb.068718,215,,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
A novel insecticide impairs bumblebee memory and sucrose responsiveness across high and low nutrition,277,JOUR,"Gray, L.K.; Hulsey, M.; Siviter, H.",Royal Society Open Science,"Wild bees are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers but are exposed to a myriad of different anthropogenic stressors, such as pesticides and poor nutrition, as a consequence of intensive agriculture. These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'.

A novel laboratory method for simulating pollinator exposure to agrochemical-laden particulate matter,511,JOUR,"['Green, F.B.', 'Peterson, E.M.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Ecotoxicology,"Environmental transport and deposition of particulate matter (PM) associated with toxic chemicals has begun to receive attention as a source of risk to pollinators. For example, dust arising from manipulations of insecticide-treated seed has potential to exert toxic effects among non-target insects. Similarly, synthetic steroid growth promoters, antibiotics and multiple insecticides and parasiticides detected in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM may also negatively impact pollinators since many of these chemicals have been detected on wildflowers and pollinators collected near beef cattle feedyards. Therefore, there is a need to assess risk to pollinators posed by deposition of agrochemical-laden PM, both in the field and the laboratory. Unfortunately, established laboratory methods for simulating PM exposure or toxicity associated with contaminated PM are few and highly situation-specific. Herein we describe development and use of a PM circulation system that can be employed to evaluate toxicity of agrochemical-contaminated PM in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Two model organisms (honeybees (Apis mellifera) and mason bees (Osmia lignaria)) were exposed to agrochemical-free PM in the circulator system, and post-exposure mortality was compared with controls. No significant differences in mortality between exposed and control bees were observed. Next, honeybees and mason bees were exposed to PM spiked with an insecticide known to exert toxic effects to pollinators (thiamethoxam). Bees experienced significantly higher mortality when exposed to thiamethoxam-laden PM at environmentally relevant concentrations as compared to bees exposed to agrochemical-free PM. These results confirm the validity of these methods for use in controlled laboratory PM toxicity tests and offer a source of positive and negative control groups for laboratory and field experiments examining exposure of pollinators to potentially toxic agrochemical-laden PM. This method facilitates generation of more realistic toxicity data than standard contact toxicity tests when pollinator exposure scenarios involve particulate-based agrochemicals or other toxic chemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02660-9,32,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

Neonicotinoids are the most commonly used insecticide globally, but restrictions on their use and rising pest resistance have increased the demand for alternative pesticides. Flupyradifurone is a novel insecticide that has been licenced globally for use on bee-visited crops. Here, in a semi-field experiment, we exposed solitary bees (Osmia lignaria) to a commercial pesticide formulation (Sivanto Prime) containing flupyradifurone at label-recommended rates. We originally designed the experiment to examine sublethal effects, but contrary to our expectations, 100 % of bees released into pesticide-treated cages died within 3 days of exposure, compared to 0 % in control plots. Bees exposed to flupyradifurone a few days after the initial application survived but endured prolonged sublethal effects, including lower nesting success, impairment to foraging efficiency, and higher mortality. These results demonstrate that exposure to this novel insecticide poses significant threats to solitary bees and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that this pesticide can have negative impacts on wild bees at field-realistic concentrations. In the short-term, we recommend that commercial formulations containing flupyradifurone should be restricted to non-flowering crops while a reassessment of its safety can be conducted. In the long-term, environmental risk assessors should continue to develop risk assessments that are truly holistic and incorporate the ecological and life history traits of multiple pollinator species. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175935,952,0.0,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
A potential trade-off between offense and defense in honeybee innate immunity: Reduced phagocytosis in honeybee hemocytes correlates with a protective response after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz,80,JOUR,"['Sukkar, D', 'Laval-Gilly, P', 'Kanso, A', 'Azoury, S', 'Bonnefoy, A', 'Falla-Angel, J']",PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"Phagocytosis ""offense"" is a crucial process to protect the organism from diseases and the effects of foreign particles. Insects rely on the innate immune system and thus any hindrance to phagocytosis may greatly affect their resistance to diseases and response to pathogens. The European honeybee, a valuable species due to its economic and environmental contribution, is being challenged by colony collapse disorder leading to its decline. Exposure to multiple factors including pesticides like imidacloprid and amitraz may negatively alter their immune response and ultimately make them more susceptible to diseases. In this study, we compare the effect of different concentrations and mixtures of imidacloprid and amitraz with different concentrations of the immune stimulant, zymosan A. Results show that imidacloprid and amitraz have a synergistic negative effect on phagocytosis. The lowered phagocytosis induces significantly higher hemocyte viability suggesting a negatively correlated protective mechanism ""defense"" from pesticide -associated damage but may not be protective from pathogens.",2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105772,199,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,

Toxicity data are submitted to support these assessments and the USEPA maintains a large database containing acute and chronic toxicity data on adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera), which USEPA considers a surrogate for Apis and non-Apis bees. We compared these toxicity data to explore possible trends. This analysis indicated a significant correlation between acute contact and oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for adult honey bees (ρ = 0.74, p <0.0001). Using default EPA modeling assumptions, where exposure for an individual bee is roughly 12x lower through contact than through ingestion, the analysis indicates that the oral LD50 is similarly if not more protective of the contact LD50 for the majority of pesticides and modes of action evaluated. The analysis also provided evidence that compounds with a lower acute toxicity for adults through contact and oral exposure pathways may still be acutely toxic for larvae. The acute toxicity of herbicides and fungicides was higher for larvae relative to oral and contact toxicity for adult honey bees for the same compounds and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from chronic toxicity studies were lower for larvae relative to adults, indicating increased sensitivity of larvae. When comparing 8-day LD50 values between single dose larval acute studies to those derived from repeat dose 22-day larval chronic toxicity studies, the LD50 values derived from chronic studies were significantly lower than those from acute toxicity tests (Z = -37, p = 0.03).

A semi-field study to evaluate effects of sulfoxaflor on honey bee (Apis mellifera),848,JOUR,"['Cheng, Y.', 'Bu, Y.', 'Tan, L.', 'Wu, W.', 'Li, J.', 'Zhou, J.', 'Zhai, A.', 'Shan, Z.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"A semi-field study was conducted to investigate the effect of sulfoxaflor on honey bees and the residues in matrices after being used on cucumber. A suspension of 22% sulfoxaflor concentration was applied on cucumber at full bloom, at the rates of 75 g a.i./ha and 100 g a.i./ha, both with 2 applications at 6-day interval. Colonies were introduced into the tunnels one day after the first application, then mortality and behaviour of the test bees were observed and recorded every day. Cucumber flowers were taken and analysed for sulfoxaflor residues. The second application occurred 6 days later, then, observations of mortality and behaviour were conducted for 5 days, and then the colonies were removed from the tunnels and transported back to the apiary for 14 days additional observation. Besides, general conditions of the colonies were assessed before and after exposure, at the end of the field study. After being introduced into the tunnels, the colonies stabilized after 3 days’ adaption. During the exposure period, sulfoxaflor showed lethal toxicity on bees, but the effect was less than that caused by dimethoate. After being removed from the tunnels, the mortalities of all groups fluctuated at a low level, indicating that sulfoxaflor had no long-term lethal effect on bees. During the whole exposure period, sulfoxaflor had no effect on the flight intensity of the bees. Meanwhile, sulfoxaflor had no obvious adverse effect on the strength and the condition of the test colonies. Residue analysis showed that: on the days of application, the residue of sulfoxaflor in cucumber flower was between 5.004 mg/kg and 5.832 mg/kg. After the applications, the residue of sulfoxaflor reduced gradually, until the 6th day after the first application, the residue reduced to 0.100~0.198 mg/kg, until the 5th day after the second application, the residue reduced to 0.155~0.304 mg/kg. © 2018, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Chronic neonicotinoid exposure led to a male-biased offspring sex ratio in the solitary bee species Osmia bicornis in laboratory experiments, but semi-field or field data are largely lacking. Here, we used semi-field experiments to investigate the potential impact of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on the sex ratio of the closely related species Osmia cornuta. Male and female individuals of O. cornuta were held in flight cages with fully blooming winter oilseed rape, treated or not with clothianidin. After hibernation, sex ratio of emerging offspring and overwintering mortality was determined. A total of 191 male and 4 female, and 203 male and 2 female O. cornuta emerged in the control and the clothianidin treatment, respectively, thereby clearly showing an extremely male-biased sex ratio. However, there was no significant clothianidin treatment effect. As sex ratio was strongly biased in both, the clothianidin and the control treatment, our data can obviously not explain the underlying mechanism.

A study on lethal doses of various pesticides on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) - a laboratory trial,140,JOUR,"['Pervez, M', 'Manzoor, F']",PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Exposure of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) to pesticides disturbed normal physiological and behavioral functions required for normal foraging and colony maintenance. The present study was aimed towards establishing the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of three pesticides viz. carbamate (carbaryl), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) in honeybees through feeding bioassay laboratory trial. Deleteriousness was confirmed through mortality rate, number of survival bees, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), total protein (TP) levels, AChE gene transcription level, and gut tissues histological analysis of exposed honeybees. Mean mortality rate was calculated for 96 h interval at three different concentrations of tested pesticides (5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg L-1), and LC50 values calculated for 48 and 96 h interval. AChE enzyme and TP level are determined by ELIZA and spectrophotometer, respectively. Results revealed that imidacloprid had the lowest LC50 (0.477 ng/bee) values as compared with carbaryl and chlorpyrifos. High mortality rate was observed at highest dose, being impidacloprid have more lethal effects as compared with other pesticides. Similarly, biochemical analysis revealed that imidiacloprid and chlorpyrifos significantly (P <= 0.05) increased AChE and TP levels, whereas carbaryl significantly (P <= 0.05) decreased them. Similarly, probe based RT qPCR revealed that imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatments significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the AChE level whereas carbaryl decreased it. Histological analysis showed that the gut tissues of honeybees exposed to pesticide treatment had substantial morphological abnormalities.

A sublethal dose of neonicotinoid imidacloprid precisely sensed and detoxified by a C-minus odorant-binding protein 17 highly expressed in the legs of Apis cerana,47,JOUR,"['Qiu, Y.-L.', 'Wu, F.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Jiang, H.-Q.', 'Chen, J.-T.', 'Pan, Y.-J.', 'Li, H.-L.']",Science of the Total Environment,"As a native honeybee species in East Asia, Apis cerana is essential for the stability of local agricultural and plant ecosystems by its' olfactory system for searching nectar and pollen sources. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 × 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana. Also, our research enriches the theoretical knowledge of the sensing and detoxifying activities of non-target insects' olfactory sensory system to environmental sublethal doses of systemic insecticides. © 2023",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163762,885,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Colonies were sorted into three treatments (60 colonies per treatment) exposed to sunflower blooms grown from seeds treated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin and a non-treated control. Each colony was assessed at six moments: one before to exposition to sunflower, two during the exposition (short-time risk), two after exposition (medium-time risk) and one after wintering (long-time risk). The health and development of the colonies were assessed by monitoring adult bee population, brood development, status of the queen, food reserves and survival. No significant difference among treatments when raw data was considered. However, when evolution from initial status of the colony was evaluated, a significant difference was observed from the first week of exposure to sunflower blooms. In this period, the number of adult bees and the amount of brood were slightly lower in the bee hives exposed to neonicotinoids, although such differences disappeared in subsequent evaluations. The concentration of residues in samples of beebread and adult bees was at the level of ng·g−1. Magnitude of the effect of the treatment factor on the variability of colony health and development related parameters was low. The most important factor was the hive, followed by the replicate and year, and to a lesser extent the initial strength of the colonies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127735,262,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
A toxicogenomics approach reveals characteristics supporting the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) safety profile of the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone,636,JOUR,"['Haas, J.', 'Zaworra, M.', 'Glaubitz, J.', 'Hertlein, G.', 'Kohler, M.', 'Lagojda, A.', 'Lueke, B.', 'Maus, C.', 'Almanza, M.-T.', 'Davies, T.G.E.', 'Bass, C.', 'Nauen, R.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Flupyradifurone, a novel butenolide insecticide, selectively targets insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), comparable to structurally different insecticidal chemotypes such as neonicotinoids and sulfoximines. However, flupyradifurone was shown in acute toxicity tests to be several orders of magnitude less toxic to western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) than many other insecticides targeting insect nAChRs. The underlying reasons for this difference in toxicity remains unknown and were investigated here. Pharmacokinetic studies after contact application of [14C]flupyradifurone to honey bees revealed slow uptake, with internalized compound degraded into a few metabolites that are all practically non-toxic to honey bees in both oral and contact bioassays. Furthermore, receptor binding studies revealed a lack of high-affinity binding of these metabolites to honey bee nAChRs. Screening of a library of 27 heterologously expressed honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of flupyradifurone: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3. Transgenic Drosophila lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less susceptible to flupyradifurone when compared to control flies, confirming the importance of these P450s for flupyradifurone metabolism in honey bees. Biochemical assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BOMFC) indicated a weak, non-competitive inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by flupyradifurone. In contrast, the azole fungicides prochloraz and propiconazole were strong nanomolar inhibitors of these flupyradifurone metabolizing P450s, explaining their highly synergistic effects in combination with flupyradifurone as demonstrated in acute laboratory contact toxicity tests of adult bees. Interestingly, the azole fungicide prothioconazole is only slightly synergistic in combination with flupyradifurone – an observation supported by molecular P450 inhibition assays. Such molecular assays have value in the prediction of potential risks posed to bees by flupyradifurone mixture partners under applied conditions. Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of the identified P450 genes in all honey bee life-stages, with highest expression levels observed in late larvae and adults, suggesting honey bees have the capacity to metabolize flupyradifurone across all life-stages. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the low intrinsic toxicity of flupyradifurone to honey bees and offer a new, more holistic approach to support bee pollinator risk assessment by molecular means. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112247,217,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Samples were extracted by a modified QuEChERS procedure and screened for pesticides residues by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pesticide hazard in the samples was evaluated through the hazard quotient approach (HQ). Beebread was widely contaminated with coumaphos and amitraz degradate 2, 4-dimethylphenylformamide (DMF), miticides detected in 94 and 97% of samples respectively. However, insecticides sprayed during citrus bloom like chlorpyrifos (up to 167 ng g −1)and dimethoate (up to 34 ng g −1)were the main responsible of the relevant pesticide hazard in this matrix. Pesticide levels in live bees were mostly residual, and pesticide hazard was low. Beeswax of the apiaries, contaminated by miticides, revealed a low pesticide hazard to honey bee colonies. Acute mortality episodes occurred only in the two apiaries located near agricultural settings. Dead bees collected during these episodes revealed high levels (up to 2700 ng g −1)of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, omethoate and imidacloprid.

These insecticides, however, show very strong toxicity to pollinating insects and in particular to the honey bee, besides causing also other effects which are often not easily identifiable, such as behavioural disturbances, orientation difficulties, and impairment of social activities. During the past few years, in many countries, alarming bee mortality rates were recorded. In some cases this was clearly due to the use of neonicotinoids either for seed dressing or crop spraying. It was therefore considered appropriate to test on three strains of Apis mellifera of Piedmontese origin and referable to A. in. ligustica in the laboratory both the acute oral toxicity of Imidacloprid, which had been, in use for many years, and Clothianidin and Thiametoxam, only more recently introduced in Italy. To reach this aim, methods developed at the Di.Va.P.R.A. and applied in several previous studies, were used. Commercial products were used throughout the tests. They were tested at the recommended concentration for field treatments. When mortality was higher in the tested bees than in the untreated ones, the active ingredients were tested at gradually decreasing concentrations so as to reach a mortality not significantly different from that found in the untreated controls. The LD(50) calculated for Clothianidin and Thiametoxam were lower than for imidacloprid; the differences between the honey bee strains for the same active ingredient were slight.",2010,,93,,0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
ATTRACTIVENESS AND TOXICITY OF IMIDACLOPRID AND DELTAMETHRIN INSECTICIDES AGAINST Tetragonula laeviceps SMITH (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini),463,JOUR,"['Mubin, N.', 'Audia, B.H.', 'Nurulalia, L.']",Journal of the International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences,"Tetragonula laeviceps is one of the bees that plays an essential role in pollinating plants. Currently, the existence of bee populations is in danger of decreasing. One of the reasons was the inappropriate use of pesticides. The pesticide groups that influence bee behavior and mortality are neonicotinoid and pyrethroid. This study sought to determine the attractiveness and toxic effect of imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and deltamethrin (pyrethroid) insecticides on T. laeviceps. The experiments were conducted on May to July 2022 at Insect Physiology and Toxicology Laboratory, Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agricultural University. The olfactory response of T. laeviceps was carried out using a Y-tube olfactometer with odor sources including imidacloprid (200 ppm), deltamethrin (12.5 ppm), mineral water and honey. Toxicity bioassays of T. laeviceps were carried out by topical, residual, and oral applications at five insecticide concentrations. Bees were more attracted to honey and water than imidacloprid 200 ppm or deltamethrin 12.5 ppm, while the attractiveness between imidacloprid 200 ppm and deltamethrin 12.5 ppm did not show a significant difference. The toxic effect of imidacloprid on T. laeviceps was greater than deltamethrin for the three different bioassays of insecticides. These two active ingredients were classified as highly toxic (LD50 <2 μg/bee) based on EPA classification. The implication of these results is the farmer should not spray the insecticide particularly imidacloprid and deltamethrin on their chili plantation during flowering stages. © 2023, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

In this article, the foraging behavior of the honey bee workers was investigated to show the effects of imidacloprid. By measuring the time interval between two visits at the same feeding site, we found that the normal foraging interval of honey bee workers was within 300s. However, these honey bee workers delayed their return visit for >300s when they were treated orally with sugar water containing imidacloprid. This time delay in their return visit is concentration-dependent, and the lowest effective concentration was found to be 50 /μg/liter. When bees were treated with an imidacloprid concentration higher than 1,200 /μg/liter, they showed abnormalities in revisiting the feeding site. Some of them went missing, and some were present again at the feeding site the next day. Returning bees also showed delay in their return trips.

However, the roles of PDIA6 in Apis cerana cerana are poorly understood. Herein, we obtained the PDIA6 gene from A. cerana cerana (AccPDIA6).

Western blot analysis indicated that AccPDIA6 was also upregulated by oxidative stress at the protein level. In addition, a survival test demonstrated that the survival rate of E. call cells expressing AccPDIA6 increased under oxidative stress, suggesting a possible antioxidant function of AccPDIA6. In addition, we tested the transcripts of other antioxidant genes and found that some of them were downregulated in AccPDIA6 knockdown samples. It was also discovered that the antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in AccPDIA6-silenced bees. Moreover, the survival rate of AccPDIA6 knockdown bees decreased under oxidative stress, implying that AccPDIA6 may function in the oxidative stress response by enhancing the viability of honeybees.

Several potential contributing factors have been identified, and exposure to pesticides is of increasing concern. In maize fields, foraging bees are exposed to residual concentrations of insecticides such as neonicotinoids used for seed coating. Highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoids are also reported to increase AChE activity in other invertebrates exposed to sub-lethal doses. The purpose of this study was therefore to test if the honey bee's AChE activity could be altered by neonicotinoid compounds and to explore possible effects of other common products used in maize fields: atrazine and glyphosate. One week prior to pollen shedding, beehives were placed near three different field types: certified organically grown maize, conventionally grown maize or non-cultivated. At the same time, caged bees were exposed to increasing sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and clothianidin) and herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) under controlled conditions. While increased AChE activity was found in all fields after 2 weeks of exposure, bees close to conventional maize crops showed values higher than those in both organic maize fields and non-cultivated areas. In caged bees, AChE activity increased in response to neonicotinoids, and a slight decrease was observed by glyphosate. These results are discussed with regard to AChE activity as a potential biomarker of exposure for neonicotinoids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,10.1007/s11356-013-1568-2,20,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Acute Imidacloprid Exposure Alters Mitochondrial Function in Bumblebee Flight Muscle and Brain,656,JOUR,"['Sargent, C.', 'Ebanks, B.', 'Hardy, I.C.W.', 'Davies, T.G.E.', 'Chakrabarti, L.', 'Stöger, R.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Mitochondria are intracellular organelles responsible for cellular respiration with one of their major roles in the production of energy in the form of ATP. Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

This study was aimed to determine the acute and chronic toxic effects of thiacloprid (IUPAC name: {(2Z)-3-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene}cyanamide) on behavioral and physiological performance as well as genome-wide transcriptome in A. cerana. We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana. Altogether, our study deepens the understanding of the toxicological characteristic of A. cerana against thiacloprid, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress. © 2023",2023,10.1016/j.pestbp.2023.105483,194,,0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

The THC was not altered with the insecticide exposure and/or bacterial infection. However, the DHC of the bees changed with the imidacloprid exposure and/or bacterial infection. The number of prohemocytes (stem cells) increased in bees exposed to imidacloprid, but it did not change after the bacterial infection. The number of plasmatocytes (phagocytic cells) increased in imidacloprid-exposed and uninfected bees and decreased in infected bees regardless of the exposure to imidacloprid. On the other hand, there was a reduction of granulocytes, the most active immune cells, after imidacloprid exposure and an increase of granulocytes after the infection. Previous studies have shown that the neonicotinoids exposure can impair the immune system of bees. Our findings showed that the relative number of granulocytes declined with imidacloprid exposure, but the overall capacity of hemocyte responses in terms of total numbers after bacterial infection persisted even after the insecticide exposure. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,10.1016/j.pestbp.2018.08.002,152,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

Acute contact toxicity of insecticidal baits on honeybees Apis mellifera: a laboratory study,76,JOUR,"['Domatskaya, TF', 'Domatskiy, AN', 'Levchenko, MA', 'Silivanova, EA']",UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,"The honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an important pollinator, an object of human economic activity and a bioindicator of environmental pollution. Insecticides used in Agriculture for treatment of plants, bee colonies, and farm animals may be dangerous for bees. This paper reports the results of a comparative assessment of the acute contact toxicity of four toxic bait formulations designed for insect pest control on livestock farms to the honeybees. Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions. The future semi-field and field studies are needed to evaluate the possible exposure and the hazard degree of insecticidal baits for bees under conditions close to practice use of these formulations.",2018,10.15421/2018_289,8,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,

Laboratory-reared O. lignaria females were exposed to three concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 50, 390 and 780 ppb), in wet (30% moisture) soil for 20 min and released in large flight cages, where impacts on nesting activity and nest cell production were evaluated. Mortality was tested in another experiment using exposure at the same concentrations with two differing soil moisture levels (20% and 40%). Nesting activity was reduced by 42% for females exposed at 390 ppb and by 66% for females exposed at 780 ppb. Females treated at 780 ppb produced 40% fewer nest cells per day. Sex ratios of F1 generation were skewed toward male in the 50 ppb treatment group with 50% fewer females. The number of cells and pre-pupae per nest, as well as the weight of pre-pupal cocoons did not vary among exposure levels. There were no mortality effects at 20% soil moisture for any level of imidacloprid, but at 40%, mortality of females was >50% at all levels of imidacloprid. These results suggest that acute exposure to imidacloprid residue in soil can have negative impacts on soil-interacting bees, and the effects may be relative to the degree of soil moisture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128572,264,,0,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

A major factor implicated in their decline is exposure to agricultural chemicals, in particular the neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid. Honeybees are also subjected to additional chemical exposure when beekeepers treat hives with acaricides to combat the mite Varroa destructor. Here, we assess the effects of acute sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos, on honey bee learning and memory. Imidacloprid had little effect on performance in a six-trial olfactory conditioning assay, while coumaphos caused a modest impairment.

Acute exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides increases heat tolerance in honey bees,594,JOUR,"['Gonzalez, V.H.', 'Hranitz, J.M.', 'McGonigle, M.B.', 'Manweiler, R.E.', 'Smith, D.R.', 'Barthell, J.F.']",PLoS ONE,"The European honey bee, Apis mellifera L., is the single most valuable managed pollinator in the world. Poor colony health or unusually high colony losses of managed honey bees result from a myriad of stressors, which are more harmful in combination. Climate change is expected to accentuate the effects of these stressors, but the physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees to elevated temperatures while under simultaneous influence of one or more stressors remain largely unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that exposure to acute, sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides reduce thermal tolerance in honey bees. We administered to bees oral doses of imidacloprid and acetamiprid at 1/5, 1/20, and 1/100 of LD50 and measured their heat tolerance 4 h post-feeding, using both dynamic and static protocols. Contrary to our expectations, acute exposure to sublethal doses of both insecticides resulted in higher thermal tolerance and greater survival rates of bees. Bees that ingested the higher doses of insecticides displayed a critical thermal maximum from 2 ̊C to 5 ̊C greater than that of the control group, and 67%–87% reduction in mortality. Our study suggests a resilience of honey bees to high temperatures when other stressors are present, which is consistent with studies in other insects. We discuss the implications of these results and hypothesize that this compensatory effect is likely due to induction of heat shock proteins by the insecticides, which provides temporary protection from elevated temperatures. © 2022 Gonzalez et al",2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0240950,17,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25 medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50 were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively. For Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, topical and oral LD50 were 0.244 mu g/bee and 0.056 mu g/bee, respectively. For Spinosad, the oral LD50 corresponded to 0.28 mu g/bee; it was not possible to establish the LD50 for the contact route.

As it may not be possible to stop using pesticides at the moment due to a growing food demand, we need to make every effort to ensure that they are used in a way that do not jeopardize pollinator populations. We tested the toxicity of three agrochemicals, namely Dursban 480 EC with chlorpyrifos as active ingredient (a.i.), Sherpa 100 EC (a.i. cypermethrin), and Mospilan 20 SP (a.i. acetamiprid), to female Osmia bicornis through oral and contact exposures. The estimated LC50 s at infinite-time were lower than concentrations recommended for field application for Dursban in both exposure routes, whereas in case of Sherpa and Mospilan the values were lower for oral exposure only. Regardless of the exposure route, high mortality in less than 24 hours was observed in Dursban-treated bees at a fraction of concentration actually used by farmers in the field, indicating high toxicity of this product to O. bicornis. Therefore, some commonly used insecticides may cause unacceptable effects to pollinators even when applied in the field according to recommendations, indicating the urgent need for revising current pesticide usage regulations. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

In recent years, honey bee populations have declined in some parts of the world, which has been associated with several causes, including pesticides used in agriculture. Neonicotinoids are neurotoxic insecticides widely used in the world with systemic action mode contaminating nectar and pollen that may be consumed by bees. This study evaluated the side effects of imidacloprid in the midgut of A. mellifera after acute oral exposure. Toxicity, histopathology, cytotoxicity, and expression of autophagy-related gene atg1 were evaluated in honey bee workers orally exposed to imidacloprid. The estimated imidacloprid LC50 was 1.44 mg L−1. The midgut epithelium of bees fed on imidacloprid LC50 has the occurrence of cytoplasm vacuoles, enlarged intercellular spaces, disorganization of the striated border, and nuclear pyknosis, with an organ injury index that increases with time exposure. The midgut digestive cells of treated bees have apical protrusions, damaged mitochondria, and autophagosomes that were characterized for content with organelle debris and high expression of atg1.

Acute oral toxicity and risks of four classes of systemic insecticide to the Common Eastern Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens),565,JOUR,"['Mundy-Heisz, K.A.', 'Prosser, R.S.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Chemosphere,"The Common Eastern Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) is native to North America with an expanding range across Eastern Canada and the USA. This species is commercially produced primarily for greenhouse crop pollination and is a common and abundant component of the wild bumblebee fauna in agricultural, suburban and urban landscapes. However, there is a dearth of pesticide toxicity information about North American bumblebees. The present study determined the acute oral lethal toxicity (48-h LD50) of: the butenolide, flupyradifurone (>1.7 μg/bee); the diamide, cyantraniliprole (>0.54 μg/bee); the neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam (0.0012 μg/bee); and the sulfoximine, sulfoxaflor (0.0177 μg/bee). Compared with published honey bee (Apis mellifera) LD50 values, the present study shows that sulfoxaflor and thiamethoxam are 8.3× and 3.3× more acutely toxic to B. impatiens, whereas flupyradifurone is more acutely toxic to A. mellifera. The current rule of thumb for toxicity extrapolation beyond the honey bee as a model species, termed 10× safety factor, may be sufficient for bumblebee acute oral toxicity. A comparison of five risk assessment equations suggested that the Standard Risk Approach (SRA) and Fixed Dose Risk Approach (FDRA) provide more nuanced levels of risk evaluation compared to the Exposure Toxicity Ratio (ETR), Hazard Quotient (HQ), and Risk Quotient (RQ), primarily because the SRA and FDRA take into account real world variability in pollen and nectar pesticide residues and the chances that bees may be exposed to them. © 2022 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133771,295,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees.

Meanwhile，risk assessment was carried out by risk quotients (RQ) method when the 9 insecticides were applied by spraying. The results showed that：the toxicity levels of 70% imidacridine WG，10% dimethylamine AS，25% thiazolazine SC，5% dithiocarba-mate GF and 2. 5% deltamethrin EC to honeybees were all at high class. However，the risk levels were different，and the risk of 25% thiazolazine SC，70% imidacridine WG，10% dimethylamine AS and 2. 5% deltamethrin EC were unaccept-able to honeybees. The risk of 5% dithiocarbamate GF to honeybees could be reduced by decreasing the amount and fre-quency of use. The oral and contact toxicity of 50% pirimicarb WP were moderate and low to honeybees，respectively， and the risk could also be reduced by decreasing the amount and frequency of use. The toxicity levels of 5% acetamiprid EC，48% thiacloprid SC and 25% pymetrozine SC to honeybees were moderate，low and low，respectively. The risk lev-els of those insecticides are acceptable. The insecticides with low-risk to honeybees such as thiacloprid and pymetrozine could be priority to control the aphids in oilseed rape fields.

Acute toxicity of five pesticides to Apis mellifera larvae reared in vitro,839,JOUR,"['Dai, P.', 'Jack, C.J.', 'Mortensen, A.N.', 'Ellis, J.D.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: The reported high loss rates of managed honey bee colonies have been attributed to diverse stressors including pesticides. Honey bee larvae can be exposed to pesticides in contaminated nectar, pollen and wax. Due to the difficulties of rearing larvae in vitro, research focusing on adult bee exposure to pesticides is more common than that on larva exposure to pesticides. Herein, we aimed to assess the acute toxicity of five insecticides to honey bee larvae using an improved in vitro rearing method. RESULTS: LC50 and LD50 were calculated for larvae at 72 h following a single diet exposure administered when the larvae were 84 ± 12 h old. Solvent control larval mortalities were less than 15% at 72 h. The LC50 values (mg L−1) for each tested pesticide were as follows: amitraz, 494.27; chlorpyrifos, 15.39; coumaphos, 90.01; fluvalinate, 27.69; and imidacloprid, 138.84. The LD50 values in µg per larva were 14.83 (amitraz), 0.46 (chlorpyrifos), 2.70 (coumaphos), 0.83 (fluvalinate) and 4.17 (imidacloprid).

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2× deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Our findings suggest that additivity is a good baseline for predicting the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to bees, and that the rare cases of synergy of pesticide mixtures to bees are not random but have a mechanistic basis. © 2022 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159518,857,,0,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,
Acute toxicity of sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid and clothianidin to immune response and oxidative status of honey bees,574,JOUR,"['Orčić, S.M.', 'Čelić, T.V.', 'Purać, J.S.', 'Vukašinović, E.L.', 'Kojić, D.K.']",Apidologie,"The use of insecticides, especially neonicotinoids (NEOCs), poses a significant threat to honey bees, thus prompting the EU to ban all outdoor uses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. However, due to the persistence of NEOCs, as well as the fact that certain NEOCs are in use in some areas of the world, exposure to them is still an on-going issue. In the present study, we used laboratory acute toxicity test to examine the effects of sublethal concentrations (resulting in consumed doses approximately 50, 20, and 5 times below LD50) of thiacloprid and clothianidin on selected parameters of antioxidative defense (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase activities), oxidative status (reduced glutathione, protein thiols, malondialdehyde), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), and immune response (prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities) in honey bees. Results indicated that both neonicotinoids’ sublethal concentrations promote oxidative stress in honey bees and affect their immune defense. NEOCs impair detoxification abilities through reduced glutathione S-transferase activity, as well as disturb immune response due to decreased prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities, which can explain the high toxicity of these substances to honey bees. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00959-w,53,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Acute toxicity of the fungicide captan to honey bees and mixed evidence for synergism with the insecticide thiamethoxam,407,JOUR,"['De Souza, D.', 'Urbanowicz, C.', 'Ng, W.H.', 'Baert, N.', 'Fersch, A.A.', 'Smith, M.L.', 'McArt, S.H.']",Scientific Reports,"Honey bees are commonly co-exposed to pesticides during crop pollination, including the fungicide captan and neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam. We assessed the impact of exposure to these two pesticides individually and in combination, at a range of field-realistic doses. In laboratory assays, mortality of larvae treated with captan was 80–90% greater than controls, dose-independent, and similar to mortality from the lowest dose of thiamethoxam. There was evidence of synergism (i.e., a non-additive response) from captan-thiamethoxam co-exposure at the highest dose of thiamethoxam, but not at lower doses. In the field, we exposed whole colonies to the lowest doses used in the laboratory. Exposure to captan and thiamethoxam individually and in combination resulted in minimal impacts on population growth or colony mortality, and there was no evidence of synergism or antagonism. These results suggest captan and thiamethoxam are each acutely toxic to immature honey bees, but whole colonies can potentially compensate for detrimental effects, at least at the low doses used in our field trial, or that methodological differences of the field experiment impacted results (e.g., dilution of treatments with natural pollen). If compensation occurred, further work is needed to assess how it occurred, potentially via increased queen egg laying, and whether short-term compensation leads to long-term costs. Further work is also needed for other crop pollinators that lack the social detoxification capabilities of honey bee colonies and may be less resilient to pesticides. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,10.1038/s41598-024-66248-x,14,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Agri-environment schemes enhance pollinator richness and abundance but bumblebee reproduction depends on field size,135,JOUR,"['Geppert, C', 'Hass, A', 'Földesi, R', 'Donkó, B', 'Akter, A', 'Tscharntke, T', 'Batary, P']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pollinators have experienced a dramatic decrease world-wide due to agricultural intensification. In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13682,57,1.0,0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,
Agricultural landscape composition affects the development and life expectancy of colonies ofBombus impatiens,334,JOUR,"['Gervais, A', 'Fournier', 'Bélisle, M']",ECOSPHERE,"Bumble bees are essential, efficient pollinators of numerous crops, and scientists are increasingly concerned about their global decline. Although several potential causes have been put forward, the concurrent modification of landscape structure and pesticide use by agriculture are often pointed out as the main drivers of the decline. Yet, the mechanisms through which these factors cause species to decline remain elusive. Most field studies have been conducted at the individual level, and the few studies that addressed higher levels of organization only covered narrow ecological conditions. We undertook a field experiment in spring 2016 to overcome these limitations by placing four commercialBombus impatienscolonies in each of 20 sites located along a gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that landscape habitat composition and configuration, as well as local floral resources, would affect colony development. We expected colonies surrounded by low-intensity and/or flowering crops in heterogeneous landscapes to develop better and live longer, partly linked to more abundant and diversified food resources, than colonies embedded in landscapes dominated by high-intensity crops. Colonies were weighed once a week, and workers were captured to assess pollen load diversity. Final colony weight, queen production, and presence of depredators (Aphomia sociella, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were also recorded. Landscape habitat composition and configuration were characterized within 1 km of colonies. Local availability of floral resources was assessed within 100 m of colonies every two weeks. As predicted, colony weight and longevity decreased with the proportion of intensive crops and increased with the amount of flowering crops, but queen production and the occurrence ofA. sociellawere not affected by landscape composition. Contrary to our prediction, local availability of floral resources also did not affect colonies. The pollen richness brought back to colonies decreased with the proportion of flowering crops and varied according to the proportion of intensive crops interacting with local floral resources. Our work contributes to generalize the more restrictive conclusion of local-scale, crop-specific studies that intensive crop farming undermines bumble bee colony development and that it may thus play a role in the large-scale population decline of these insects.",2020,10.1002/ecs2.3142,11,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

We have analysed the susceptibility of the Africanized honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the stingless bee, Partamona helleri, to commercial formulations of the insecticides deltamethrin and imidacloprid. The toxicity of fungicides based on thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil were investigated individually and in combination, and with the insecticides. Results showed that stingless bees were more susceptible to insecticides than honeybees. The commercial fungicides thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil caused low mortality, regardless of concentration; however, their combination was as toxic as imidacloprid to both species, and over 400-fold more toxic than deltamethrin for A. mellifera. There were highly synergistic effects on mortality caused by interactions in the mixture of imidacloprid and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl, chlorothalonil and the combined fungicide formulation in A. mellifera, and also to a lesser extent in P. helleri. By contrast, mixtures of the deltamethrin and the combined fungicide formulation induced high synergy in P. helleri, but had little effect on the mortality of A. mellifera.

Based on available data (USEPA 2014), this insecticide appears to have a favorable safety profile for honey bee colonies. As a result, the label permits the product to be applied during prebloom and bloom in various crops, including citrus, except when mixed with azole fungicides during the blooming period. We placed 24 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies adjacent to eight flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) fields that either had been sprayed with the maximum label rate of flupyradifurone or with water only (control fields), with three colonies placed adjacent to each field. We conducted colony strength assessments during which the number of adult bees, eggs, uncapped brood cells, capped brood cells, food storage cells, and weights of honey supers and brood chambers were determined prior to, during, and after the flowering period. We also analyzed bee-collected pollen and nectar for flupyradifurone residues. Overall, there were no differences in any colony strength parameter for colonies placed at control and flupyradifurone-treated buckwheat fields. Residue analyses showed that pollen (x = 565.8 ppb) and nectar (x = 259.4 ppb) gathered by bees on fields treated with flupyradifurone contained significantly higher flupyradifurone residues than did bee bread and unprocessed nectar collected by bees from control fields (75% of samples <LOD). Within the conditions set forth by our experimental design, our collective data suggest no adverse effects of flupyradifurone on honey bee colonies when following label directions. © 2016 The Authors.",2016,10.1093/jee/tow186,109,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
"An observational study of honey bee colony winter losses and their association with Varroa destructor, neonicotinoids and other risk factors",932,JOUR,"['Van Der Zee, R.', 'Gray, A.', 'Pisa, L.', 'De Rijk, T.']",PLoS ONE,"This article presents results of an analysis of honey bee losses over the winter of 2011-2012 in the Netherlands, from a sample of 86 colonies, located at 43 apiaries. The apiaries were selected using spatially stratified random sampling. Colony winter loss data were collected and related to various measures of colony strength recorded in summer, as well as data from laboratory analysis of sample material taken from two selected colonies in each of the 43 apiaries. The logistic regression model which best explained the risk of winter loss included, in order of statistical importance, the variables (1) Varroa destructor mite infestation rate in October 2011, (2) presence of the cyano-substituted neonicotinoids acetamiprid or thiacloprid in the first 2 weeks of August 2011 in at least one of the honey bee matrices honey, bees or bee bread (pollen), (3) presence of Brassica napus (oilseed rape) or Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard) pollen in bee bread in early August 2011, and (4) a measure of the unexplained winter losses for the postal code area where the colonies were located, obtained from a different dataset. We consider in the discussion that reduced opportunities for foraging in July and August because of bad weather may have added substantially to the adverse effects of acetamiprid and thiacloprid. A novel feature of this work is its use of postal code random effects from two other independent datasets collected in the annual national monitoring by questionnaires of winter losses of honey bees in the Netherlands. These were used to plan the sample selection and also in the model fitting of the data in this study. It should however be noted that the results of the present pilot study are based on limited data, which may consequently reveal strong factors but fail to demonstrate possible interaction effects.

"Antioxidation defenses of apis mellifera queens and workers respond to imidacloprid in different age-dependent ways: Old queens are resistant, foragers are not",142,JOUR,"['Paleolog, J.', 'Wilde, J.', 'Miszczak, A.', 'Gancarz, M.', 'Strachecka, A.']",Animals,"We investigated how different antioxidant defenses (ADSs) were shaped by evolution in young/old Apis mellifera workers and queens to broaden the limited knowledge on whether ADSs are effective in contemporary pesticide environments and to complete bee oxidative-aging theory. We acquired 1-day-old, 20-day-old, and 2-year-old queens and 1-day-old and 20-day-old workers (foragers) fed 0, 5, or 200 ppb imidacloprid, a pesticide oxidative stressor. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase and the level of total antioxidant potential were determined in hemolymph. The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. © 2021 by the authors.

"Apis cerana Is Less Sensitive to Most Neonicotinoids, despite of Their Smaller Body Mass",843,JOUR,"['Yue, M.', 'Luo, S.', 'Liu, J.', 'Wu, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Multiple stressors and interaction between them may be responsible for the decline of global pollinators. Among them, exposure to neonicotinoids has been getting more attention and has been considered as a main stressor. The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Chinese indigenous honey bee (Apis cerana F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are two managed honey bee species in China. These two species are widely used in beekeeping, and many wild A. cerana is widely spread in forests and contributes to the ecosystem. It is predicated that A. cerana is more sensitive to insecticides than A. mellifera due to their smaller mass. Here, we found that although the body mass of A. cerana is significantly lower than A. mellifera, the sensitivity of the two species to neonicotinoids are not associated with their body mass but depended on the chemical structure of neonicotinoids. To dinotefuran, the two species showed the similar sensitivity. To acetamiprid, A. mellifera was less sensitive than A. cerana. However, to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, A. mellifera was more sensitive than A. cerana. These results suggested that the sensitivity of honey bees to neonicotinoids is closely associated with the structure of pesticides, but not with body mass of bees. It is also indicated that the hazards of pesticides to the different pollinators could not be inferred from one species to another. © 2017 The Author(s) 2017.

The intensive use of insecticides from the neonicotinoids group is among the possible causal factors of this decline, including also sub-lethal effects. However, the use of synthetic insecticides has been increased on a global scale in the recent decades. In order to evaluate an alternative to the use of neonicotinoids, this work investigated the effects of a bioinsecticide and its major compound on A. mellifera (Apidae: Hymenoptera), one of the main pollinators of crop plants. For this, bees were exposed, by contact and ingestion, to the essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii (Poaceae: Poales), to geraniol (major compound) and the insecticide imidacloprid to evaluate the toxicity and behavioral effects as well as the locomotion changes and immune responses of bees treated with these compounds. In general, toxicity was greater through ingestion and the insecticide imidacloprid was more toxic to A. mellifera compared to the essential oil and its major compound. The individual and collective behaviors (i.e. trophallaxis, grooming, avoidance) as well as the immune responses of bees were not significantly affected by bioinsecticides. However, the locomotion response and flight orientation of the bees were significantly altered by insecticide when administered by ingestion.

However, given the economic and ecological importance of stingless bees such as Melipona scutellaris in the Neotropical region, as well as the lack of studies on the effect of insecticides on these bees, toxicity tests for stingless bees should be carried out to understand whether insecticides affect both species of bees in the same manner. Thus, the present study quantified the differential sensitivity of the bees M. scutellaris and A. mellifera to the oral ingestion of the insecticide thiamethoxam by determining the mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), and their effect on the insecticide target organ, the brain. The results showed that the stingless bee is more sensitive to the insecticide than A. mellifera, with a lower LC50 of 0.0543 ng active ingredient (a.i.)/μL for the stingless bee compared to 0.227 ng a.i./μL for A. mellifera. When exposed to a sublethal concentration, morphological and ultrastructural analyses were performed and evidenced a significant increase in spaces between nerve cells of both species.

Are native bees in Brazil at risk from the exposure to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid?,559,JOUR,"['Conceição de Assis, J.', 'Tadei, R.', 'Menezes-Oliveira, V.B.', 'Silva-Zacarin, E.C.M.']",Environmental Research,"All across the world, different countries use Ecological risk assessments (ERA) of pesticides to pollinators as a regulatory tool to understand the safety of pesticide use in agriculture. However, pesticide application is still recognized as one of the main stress factors causing a decline in the global population of bees. In all ERA procedures, the effects of pesticides on the honey bee species Apis mellifera are used as a reference for the effects on all different bee species. To evaluate if tropical native bees are protected by the current risk assessment procedures and to propose improvements to the methods, we assessed the ecological risk of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid posed to native and exotic bee species. The risk was assessed through a low (TIER I) and an intermediate (TIER II) level of analysis. For TIER I the USEPA BeeREX model was used and for TIER II the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach was adopted. For the imidacloprid exposure conditions, four different crops were taken into consideration; bean, passion fruit, sunflower and tomato. The imidacloprid risk on native species was assessed both by extrapolating the effects obtained to Apis species, and by using ecotoxicological data from tests performed with native species. In TIER I, the risks calculated through empirical data showed that more than 50% of the non-Apis species presented risk levels of 28–180% higher than those obtained with the extrapolation factor used in the Brazilian pesticide regulation. In TIER II, the SSDs showed that most of the native bees are more sensitive to imidacloprid than the Africanized A. mellifera.

Assessing Insecticide Hazard to Bumble Bees Foraging on Flowering Weeds in Treated Lawns,964,JOUR,"['Larson, J.L.', 'Redmond, C.T.', 'Potter, D.A.']",PLoS ONE,"Maintaining bee-friendly habitats in cities and suburbs can help conserve the vital pollination services of declining bee populations. Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171±44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees. © 2013 Larson et al.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0066375,8,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Assessing agrochemical risk to mated honey bee queens,669,JOUR,"['Fine, J.D.', 'Torres, K.M.', 'Martin, J.', 'Robinson, G.E.']",Journal of Visualized Experiments,"Current risk assessment strategies for honey bees rely heavily upon laboratory tests performed on adult or immature worker bees, but these methods may not accurately capture the effects of agrochemical exposure on honey bee queens. As the sole producer of fertilized eggs inside a honeybee colony, the queen is arguably the most important single member of a functioning colony unit. Therefore, understanding how agrochemicals affect queen health and productivity should be considered a critical aspect of pesticide risk assessment. Here, an adapted method is presented to expose honey bee queens and worker queen attendants to agrochemical stressors administered through a worker diet, followed by tracking egg production in the laboratory and assessing first instar eclosion using a specialized cage, referred to as a Queen Monitoring Cage. To illustrate the method's intended use, results of an experiment in which worker queen attendants were fed diet containing sublethal doses of imidacloprid and effects on queens were monitored are described. © 2021 JoVE Journal of Visualized Experiments.",2021,10.3791/62316,2021,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Assessing lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees in a multifactorial context,406,JOUR,"['Frizzera, D.', 'Zanni, V.', 'Seffin, E.', 'de Miranda, J.R.', 'Marroni, F.', 'Annoscia, D.', 'Nazzi, F.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The registration of novel pesticides that are subsequently banned because of their unexpected negative effects on non-target species can have a huge environmental impact. Therefore, the pre-emptive evaluation of the potential effects of new compounds is essential. To this aim both lethal and sublethal effects should be assessed in a realistic scenario including the other stressors that can interact with pesticides. However, laboratory studies addressing such interactive effects are rare, while standardized laboratory-based protocols focus on lethal effects and not on sub-lethal effects. We propose to assess both lethal and sublethal effects in a multifactorial context including the other stressors affecting the non-target species. We tested this approach by studying the impact on honey bees of the insecticide sulfoxaflor in combination with a common parasite, a sub-optimal temperature and food deprivation. We studied the survival and the transcriptome of honey bees, to assess both the lethal and the potential sublethal effects of the insecticide, respectively. With this method we show that a field realistic concentration of sulfoxaflor in food does not affect the survival of honey bees; however, the significant impact on some key genes indicates that sublethal effects are possible in a realistically complex scenario. Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a novel approach to hazard assessment considering the interactive effects of pesticides. We anticipate our approach to be a starting point for a paradigm shift in toxicology: from an unifactorial, mortality-centered assessment to a multifactorial, comprehensive approach. This is something of the utmost importance to preserve pollination, thus contributing to the sustainability of our food production system. © 2024",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174892,948,,0,,0.0,,1.0,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,
Assessing the acute toxicity of insecticides to the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris audax),189,JOUR,"['Reid, RJ', 'Troczka, BJ', 'Kor, L', 'Randall, E', 'Williamson, MS', 'Field, LM', 'Nauen, R', 'Bass, C', 'Davies, TGE']",PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"The buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax is an important pollinator within both landscape ecosystems and agricultural crops. During their lifetime bumblebees are regularly challenged by various environmental stressors including insecticides. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing, but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other eusocial or solitary bees. To investigate this, the susceptibility of B. terrestris to selected pesticides within the neonicotinoid, pyrethroid and organophosphate classes was examined using acute insecticide bioassays. Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acet-amiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds. The sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species. This finding highlights the need to consider each compound within an insecticide class in isolation rather than extrapolating between different insecticides in the same class or sharing the same mode of action.",2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104562,166,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,
"Assessing the toxicological interaction effects of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos on Bombus terrestris based on the combination index",99,JOUR,"['Zhang, YK', 'Zeng, DQ', 'Li, L', 'Hong, XC', 'Li-Byarlay, H', 'Luo, SD']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"In modern agricultural production, a variety of pesticides are widely used to protect crops against pests. However, extensive residues of these pesticides in the soil, water, and pollen have negatively affected the health of nontarget organisms, especially among pollinators such as bumblebees. As an important pollinator, the bumblebee plays a vital role in agricultural production and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. Previous research has focused on the effects of a single pesticide on pollinating insects; however, the synergistic effects of multiple agents on bumblebees have been not studied in detail. Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos are three of common pesticides known for severe effects on bumblebee health. It is still unknown what synergistic effects of these pesticides on pollinators. In our test, the individual and combined toxicities of chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid to bumblebees after 48 h of oral administration were documented by the equivalent linear equation method. Our results showed that the toxicity of each single pesticide exposure, from high to low, was imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos. All binary and ternary combinations showed synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, our research not only shows that the mixed toxicity of insecticides has a significant effect on bumblebees, but also provides scientific guidelines for assessing the safety risks to bumblebees of these three insecticide compounds. In assessing the risk to pollinating insects, the toxicity levels of laboratory experiments are much lower than the actual toxicity in the field.",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-09808-3,12,,0,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Assessment of Contact and Oral Toxicity of Four Neonicotinoid Insecticides to Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),693,JOUR,"['Kim, A.', 'Kim, B.', 'Chon, K.', 'Lee, H.', 'Park, Y.-K.', 'You, A.-S.', 'Park, H.-H.', 'Yun, H.-J.']",Korean Journal of Environmental Agriculture,"BACKGROUND: Bumblebees have been shown to be very effective pollinators for most greenhouse tomatoes. Neonicotinoid insecticides are one of the most widely used pesticides in tomato crops in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of four neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) to bumblebees based on the OECD guidelines (No.246, 247). The 48 hr LD50 (μg a.i. /bumblebee) values in the acute contact toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.467; dinotefuran, 3.741; imidacloprid, 3.967; and thiamethoxam, 0.747. The 48 hr LD50 values in the acute oral toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.005; dinotefuran, 0.056; imidacloprid, 0.325; and thiamethoxam, 0.018. The acute contact and oral toxicity of the test insecticides to bumblebees from most to least toxic was clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran > imidacloprid.

In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicities of CYA and SUL on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae reared in vitro. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the median lethal dose (LD50): CYA 0.007, 0.014, 0.028, 0.056 and 0.112 μg larva−1; SUL 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg larva−1. In the chronic toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the LD50: CYA 0.00512, 0.0128, 0.032, 0.08 and 0.2 μg larva−1; SUL 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 μg larva−1. The acute LD50 values of CYA and SUL were 0.047 and 11.404 μg larva−1, respectively. Larvae acutely exposed to SUL had significantly lower body weight than controls, but those exposed to CYA showed no difference. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and LD50 values of the chronic toxicity tests for each insecticide were 0.00512 and 0.064 μg larva−1 for CYA, and 0.0625 μg larva−1 and 0.212 μg larva−1 for SUL, respectively. Larvae chronically exposed to SUL emerged as bees with deformed wings, reaching adult deformation rates of over 50%; however, CYA had no effect on adult deformation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to CYA increased larval mortality but did not cause any adult deformation, whereas SUL exposure increased pupal mortality and caused wing deformation in newly emerged bees. Our study may be useful for the assessment of pesticide toxicity by providing valuable findings on the effects of these insecticides on honey bee larvae. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.",2022,10.1002/ps.7162,78,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Assessment of acute sublethal effects of clothianidin on motor function of honeybee workers using video-tracking analysis,855,JOUR,"['Alkassab, A.T.', 'Kirchner, W.H.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Sublethal impacts of pesticides on the locomotor activity might occur to different degrees and could escape visual observation. Therefore, our objective is the utilization of video-tracking to quantify how the acute oral exposure to different doses (0.1–2 ng/bee) of the neonicotinoid “clothianidin” influences the locomotor activity of honeybees in a time course experiment. The total distance moved, resting time as well as the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down are measured. Our results show that bees exposed to acute sublethal doses of clothianidin exhibit a significant increase in the total distance moved after 30 and 60 min of the treatment at the highest dose (2 ng/bee). Nevertheless, a reduction of the total distance is observed at this dose 90 min post-treatment compared to the distance of the same group after 30 min, where the treated bees show an arched abdomen and start to lose their postural control. The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period. Moreover, a reduction in the resting time and increase of the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down at these doses are found. Furthermore, significant effects on the tested parameters are observed at the dose (0.5 ng/bee) first at 60 min post-treatment compared to untreated bees. The lowest dose (0.1 ng/bee) has non-significant effects on the motor activity of honeybees compared to untreated bees over the experimental period. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.047,147,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Assessment of chronic sublethal effects of imidacloprid on honey bee colony health,944,JOUR,"['Dively, G.P.', 'Embrey, M.S.', 'Kamel, A.', 'Hawthorne, D.J.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",PLoS ONE,"Here we present results of a three-year study to determine the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on whole honey bee colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 μg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 μg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 μg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 μg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 μg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 μg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. © 2015, Public Library of Science.

Assessment of sensitivity level of honeybee (Apis mellifera) to neonicotinoid insecticides,801,JOUR,"['Imran, M.', 'Naseem, T.', 'Iqbal, A.', 'Mahmood, K.', 'Sheikh, U.A.A.']",Asian Journal of Agriculture and Biology,"Declining population of honeybee day by day is the major threat, and this decline is due to variety of stressors. As honeybees are considered most important pollinators of our managed and wild corps, we investigated the effect of neonicotinoids; acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin on honeybees by ingestion and contact method. Finding of this study showed that among these neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiacloprid were most toxic insecticides with 100% mortality at realistic field doses by ingestion method with sugar solution as a substitute of nectar after the exposure of 3hrs. Honeybee's workers exposed with insecticides mixed pollen grains showed that imidacloprid and clothianidin were most toxic as compared to other insecticides at recommended field dose with 100% mortality and minimum mortality with 60% was observed at thiacloprid field dose after 3hrs exposure. The results of contact toxicity showed that all four insecticides were most toxic with wet filter paper with 100% mortality at recommend field dose after the exposure of 3hr, and with dry filter paper imidacloprid and thiacloprid showed 100% mortality and acetamiprid and clothianidin with 53.3% mortality after the exposure of 3hrs at field dose. Overall conclusion from the present study indicates that from these four insecticides imidacloprid was the most toxic as compared to all others on both ingestion and contact method at recommended field dose. © 2018.

We found seven Bombus spp., of which B. impatiens was the only known visitor of potato flowers in our region. The majority of the bees (68%) were collected at the field edges and in the field margins. Blue vane traps caught almost four-times as many bees and collected 30% more species compared to bowl traps. Bee communities did not differ across trap locations but they were different among trap types. We tested B. impatiens visitation to neonicotinoid treated and untreated potato flowers in field enclosures. The amount of time bees spent at flowers and the duration of visits were not significantly different between the two treatments. Our results demonstrate that a diverse assemblage of bees is associated with an agroecosystem dominated by potatoes despite the apparent lack of pollinator resources provided by the crop.

Endemic bee diversity and abundance among different crops has not been extensively studied, especially among perennial crops in Washington state. The goals of this study were to characterize bee genera diversity in south central Washington state, determine the abundance and diversity of bees among crop types, and determine if farming practices influence abundance and diversity by comparing bee diversity in managed agricultural sites to adjacent unmanaged, natural sites. This study investigated bee genera diversity and abundance in blueberry fields produced under organic certification programs, conventionally produced Concord juice and wine grape vineyards, conventionally produced spearmint and peppermint fields, and conventionally produced hopyards. The majority of bees found in the study were ground-nesting. Mint fields had the highest pollinator abundance and richness. In general, there was a greater abundance, diversity, and richness of bees found in unmanaged compared with managed sites.

Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,148,JOUR,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 µL for honeybees and to 2 µL for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower for the red mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Bees exposed to climate change are more sensitive to pesticides,462,JOUR,"['Albacete, S.', 'Sancho, G.', 'Azpiazu, C.', 'Rodrigo, A.', 'Molowny-Horas, R.', 'Sgolastra, F.', 'Bosch, J.']",Global Change Biology,"Bee populations are exposed to multiple stressors, including land-use change, biological invasions, climate change, and pesticide exposure, that may interact synergistically. We analyze the combined effects of climate warming and sublethal insecticide exposure in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta. Previous Osmia studies show that warm wintering temperatures cause body weight loss, lipid consumption, and fat body depletion. Because the fat body plays a key role in xenobiotic detoxification, we expected that bees exposed to climate warming scenarios would be more sensitive to pesticides. We exposed O. cornuta females to three wintering treatments: current scenario (2007–2012 temperatures), near-future (2021–2050 projected temperatures), and distant-future (2051–2080). Upon emergence in spring, bees were orally exposed to three sublethal doses of an insecticide (Closer, a.i. sulfoxaflor; 0, 4.55 and 11.64 ng a.i./bee). We measured the combined effects of wintering and insecticide exposure on phototactic response, syrup consumption, and longevity. Wintering treatment by itself did not affect winter mortality, but body weight loss increased with increasing wintering temperatures. Similarly, wintering treatment by itself hardly influenced phototactic response or syrup consumption. However, bees wintered at the warmest temperatures had shorter longevity, a strong fecundity predictor in Osmia. Insecticide exposure, especially at the high dose, impaired the ability of bees to respond to light, and resulted in reduced syrup consumption and longevity. The combination of the warmest winter and the high insecticide dose resulted in a 70% longevity decrease. Smaller bees, resulting from smaller pollen–nectar provisions, had shorter longevity suggesting nutritional stress may further compromise fecundity in O. cornuta. Our results show a synergistic interaction between two major drivers of bee declines, and indicate that bees will become more sensitive to pesticides under the current global warming scenario. Our findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and underscore the need to consider multiple stressors to understand bee declines. © 2023 The Authors.

Bees prefer foods containing neonicotinoid pesticides,926,JOUR,"['Kessler, S.C.', 'Tiedeken, E.J.', 'Simcock, K.L.', 'Derveau, S.', 'Mitchell, J.', 'Softley, S.', 'Stout, J.C.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Nature,"The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on insect pollinators is highly controversial. Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees'mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Bees under interactive stressors: the novel insecticides flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor along with the fungicide azoxystrobin disrupt the gut microbiota of honey bees and increase opportunistic bacterial pathogens,528,JOUR,"['Al Naggar, Y.', 'Singavarapu, B.', 'Paxton, R.J.', 'Wubet, T.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The gut microbiome plays an important role in bee health and disease. But it can be disrupted by pesticides and in-hive chemicals, putting honey bee health in danger. We used a controlled and fully crossed laboratory experimental design to test the effects of a 10-day period of chronic exposure to field-realistic sublethal concentrations of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), namely flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (Sulf), and a fungicide, azoxystrobin (Azoxy), individually and in combination, on the survival of individual honey bee workers and the composition of their gut microbiota (fungal and bacterial diversity). Metabarcoding was used to examine the gut microbiota on days 0, 5, and 10 of pesticide exposure to determine how the microbial response varies over time; to do so, the fungal ITS2 fragment and the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA were targeted. We found that FPF has a negative impact on honey bee survival, but interactive (additive or synergistic) effects between either insecticide and the fungicide on honey bee survival were not statistically significant. Pesticide treatments significantly impacted the microbial community composition. The fungicide Azoxy substantially reduced the Shannon diversity of fungi after chronic exposure for 10 days. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of the bee gut microbiota was also differentially affected by the fungicide, insecticides, and fungicide-insecticide combinations. Gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Serratia spp. (e.g. S. marcescens), which can have devastating consequences for host health such as increased susceptibility to infection and reduced lifespan. Our findings raise concerns about the long-term impact of novel nACHR insecticides, particularly FPF, on pollinator health and recommend a novel methodology for a refined risk assessment that includes the potential effects of agrochemicals on the gut microbiome of bees. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157941,849,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,
Bees under stress: Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid pesticide and pathogens interact to elevate honey bee mortality across the life cycle,953,JOUR,"['Doublet, V.', 'Labarussias, M.', 'de Miranda, J.R.', 'Moritz, R.F.A.', 'Paxton, R.J.']",Environmental Microbiology,"Microbial pathogens are thought to have a profound impact on insect populations. Honey bees are suffering from elevated colony losses in the northern hemisphere possibly because of a variety of emergent microbial pathogens, with which pesticides may interact to exacerbate their impacts. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered at sublethal and field realistic doses one neonicotinoid pesticide (thiacloprid) and two common microbial pathogens, the invasive microsporidian Nosema ceranae and black queen cell virus (BQCV), individually to larval and adult honey bees in the laboratory. Through fully crossed experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination, we found an additive interaction between BQCV and thiacloprid on host larval survival likely because the pesticide significantly elevated viral loads. In adult bees, two synergistic interactions increased individual mortality: between N.ceranae and BQCV, and between N.ceranae and thiacloprid. The combination of two pathogens had a more profound effect on elevating adult mortality than N.ceranae plus thiacloprid. Common microbial pathogens appear to be major threats to honey bees, while sublethal doses of pesticide may enhance their deleterious effects on honey bee larvae and adults. It remains an open question as to whether these interactions can affect colony survival. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,10.1111/1462-2920.12426,17,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Sublethal exposure to agrochemicals can affect behavior and the microbiota. Gut microbiota is associated with insect nutritional health, immunocompetence, and is essential for neutralizing the damage caused by pathogens and xenobiotics. Research on the effect of the bioinsecticides and fertilizers on the microbiota of bees remains neglected. In this study, we assessed the sublethal effect of both bioinsecticide spinosad and the fertilizer copper sulfate (CuSO4) on the behavior and gut microbiota in forager adults of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese), which is an important pollinator in the Neotropical region. Behavioral assays and gut microbiota profiles were assessed on bees orally exposed to estimated LC5 values for spinosad and CuSO4. The microbiota were characterized through 16S rRNA gene target sequencing. Acute and oral sublethal exposure to spinosad and CuSO4 did not affect the overall activity, flight take-off, and food consumption. However, CuSO4 decreased bee respiration rate and copper accumulated in exposed bees. Exposure to spinosad increased the proportional abundance of the genus Gilliamella, but CuSO4 did not alter the composition of the gut microbiota.

Toxicity tests of a 4-day exposure to individual pesticides revealed that CLO had the highest toxicity to A. mellifera, with an LC50 value of 0.24 μg a.i. mL-1, followed by IND and CHL with LC50 values of 3.40 and 3.56 μg a.i. mL-1, respectively. SPI and CAR had relatively low toxicities, with LC50 values of 7.19 and 8.42 μg a.i. mL-1, respectively. In contrast, TET exhibited the least toxicity, with an LC50 value of 258.7 μg a.i. mL-1. Most binary mixtures of CLO with other pesticides exerted additive and antagonistic effects. However, all the ternary mixtures containing CLO and TET (except for CLO+TET+THD) elicited synergistic responses to bees. Either increased numbers of components in the mixture or/and a unique mode of action appeared to be responsible for the higher toxicity of mixtures. Our findings emphasized the need for risk assessment of pesticide mixtures rather than the individual chemicals. Our data also provided information that might help growers avoid increased toxicity and unnecessary injury to pollinators. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112563,223,,0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,
Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera),866,JOUR,"['Christen, V.', 'Bachofer, S.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Pollution,"Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72 h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.105,220,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Binding of Nicotinoids and the Related Compounds to the Insect Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor,505,JOUR,"['Tomizawa, M.', 'Yamamoto, I.']",Journal of Pesticide Science,"In a radio receptor assay on the binding at the [3H]a-bungarotoxin binding site to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) obtained from housefly and honeybee head membranes, nicotine, nornicotine, anabasine and dihydronicotyrine, all with highly basic nitrogen, had a strong binding affinity, whereas myosmine, nicotyrine and cotinine, with low basic nitrogen, did not. Structure-binding relationships of the above nicotinoids and pyridylmethyl-amines mostly coincided with the previously studied relationships to the insecticidal activity, the effect on nerve activity and the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Both enantiomers of nicotine had an affinity for nAChR, although the affinity was higher in the /-form than in the d-form. Imidacloprid interacted at the same site on the nAChR, but oxadiazolone, a potent AChE inhibitor, had no affinity. © 1992, Pesticide Science Society of Japan.

Some of these negatively affect the honey bee organism. In our research, we aimed to evaluate the effects of three pesticide groups: fungicides (tebuconazole), insecticides (acetamiprid), herbicides (glyphosate), and their mixtures on the functioning of honey bee workers (A. mellifera carnica). Pesticides in various proportions and dilutions were added to sugar syrups and then fed to the bees. Mortality and food intake were recorded daily, while hemolymph analysis was performed after seven days of exposure. Food intake, mortality, and the results of various biochemical analyses differed between the experimental group and the control group receiving untreated sugar syrup. PPP’s mixture of glyphosate tebuconazole and acetamiprid is more toxic to bees than single pesticides. Certain protection products such as pesticides can disrupt the antioxidant and detoxification systems associated with immunity in honey bees. Consequently, honey bees experience weaker conditions and their proper functioning deteriorates.

Results showed that high concentrations of chlorpyrifos, malathion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and pirimiphos-methyl were detected in midgut at locations with extensive pesticide spraying. Reduced glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase displayed lowest activities in the heavily sprayed location (Tiba). Lipid peroxidation level in the midgut of honeybees in the sprayed locations was found to be significantly higher compared to the reference values. Meanwhile, various ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in the epithelial cells of midgut of honeybees collected from El Kaza and Tiba, included confluent and disorganized microvilli and destruction of their brush border, the cytoplasm with large vacuoles and alteration of cytoplasmic organelles including the presence of swollen mitochondria with lysis of matrices, disruption of limiting membranes, and disintegration of cristae. The nuclei with indented nuclear envelope and disorganized chromatin were observed. These investigated biomarkers indicated that the surveyed honeybees are being under stressful environmental conditions.

For example, bees visiting a flowering crop may be chronically exposed to low concentrations of systemic insecticides applied before bloom and then to a pulse of fungicide, considered safe for bees, applied during bloom. In this study, we simulate this scenario under laboratory conditions with females of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis L. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide, Confidor® (imidacloprid) at a realistic concentration, and of a pulse (1 day) exposure of the fungicide Folicur® SE (tebuconazole) at field application rate. Syrup consumption, survival, and four biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were evaluated at two different time points. An integrated biological response (IBRv2) index was elaborated with the biomarker results. The fungicide pulse had no impact on survival but temporarily reduced syrup consumption and increased the IBRv2 index, indicating potential molecular alterations. The neonicotinoid significantly reduced syrup consumption, survival, and the neurological activity of the enzymes. The co-exposure neonicotinoid-fungicide did not increase toxicity at the tested concentrations. AChE proved to be an efficient biomarker for the detection of early effects for both the insecticide and the fungicide.

Bees are considered one of the most important non-target insects affected by insecticides used in crop production. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to spinosad on the survival, food consumption, flight behavior, respiration rate, activity of detoxification enzymes, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), brain morphology, and hemocyte count of Apis mellifera foragers. We tested six different concentrations of spinosad for the first two analyses, followed by LC50 (7.7 mg L-1) for other assays. Spinosad ingestion decreased survival and food consumption. Exposure to spinosad LC50 reduced flight capacity, respiration rate, and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, this concentration increased glutathione S-transferase activity and the TAC of the brain. Notably, exposure to LC50 damaged mushroom bodies, reduced the total hemocyte count and granulocyte number, and increased the number of prohemocytes.

Biopesticide spinosad induces transcriptional alterations in genes associated with energy production in honey bees (Apis mellifera) at sublethal concentrations,743,JOUR,"['Christen, V.', 'Krebs, J.', 'Bünter, I.', 'Fent, K.']",Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Bees experience substantial colony losses, which are often associated with pesticides. Besides synthetic insecticides biological compounds such as spinosad are used in agriculture and organic farming against insect pests. However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.013,378,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,

Biphasic concentration-dependent interaction between imidacloprid and dietary phytochemicals in honey bees (Apis mellifera),791,JOUR,"['Wong, M.J.', 'Liao, L.-H.', 'Berenbaum, M.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Background The presence of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in nectar, honey, pollen, beebread and beeswax has been implicated in declines worldwide in the health of the western honey bee Apis mellifera. Certain phytochemicals, including quercetin and p-coumaric acid, are ubiquitous in the honey bee diet and are known to upregulate cytochrome P450 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify insecticides. Thus, the possibility exists that these dietary phytochemicals interact with ingested imidacloprid to ameliorate toxicity by enhancing its detoxification. Approach Quercetin and p-coumaric acid were incorporated in a phytochemical-free artificial diet individually and together along with imidacloprid at a range of field-realistic concentrations. In acute toxicity bioassays, honey bee 24-and 48-hour imidacloprid LC50 values were determined in the presence of the phytochemicals. Additionally, chronic toxicity bioassays were conducted using varying concentrations of imidacloprid in diets with the phytochemicals to test impacts of phytochemicals on longevity. Results In acute toxicity bioassays, the phytochemicals had no effect on imidacloprid LC50 values. In chronic toxicity longevity bioassays, phytochemicals enhanced honey bee survival at low imidacloprid concentrations (15 and 45 ppb) but had a negative effect at higher concentrations (105 ppb and 135 ppb). p-Coumaric acid alone increased honey bee longevity at concentrations of 15 and 45 ppb imidacloprid (hazard ratio (HR): 0.83 and 0.70, respectively). Quercetin alone and in combination with p-coumaric acid similarly enhanced longevity at 45 ppb imidacloprid (HR:0.81 and HR:0.77, respectively). However, p-coumaric acid in combination with 105 ppb imidacloprid and quercetin in combination with 135 ppb imidacloprid increased honey bee HR by approximately 30% (HR:1.33 and HR:1.30, respectively). Conclusions The biphasic concentration-dependent response of honey bees to imidacloprid in the presence of two ubiquitous dietary phytochemicals indicates that there are limits to the protective effects of the natural diet of honey bees against neonicotinoids based on their own inherent toxicity. © 2018 Wong et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0206625,13,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Botanical and synthetic pesticides alter the flower visitation rates of pollinator bees in Neotropical melon fields,14,JOUR,"['Tschoeke, PH', 'Oliveira, EE', 'Dalcin, MS', 'Silveira-Tschoeke, MCAC', 'Sarmento, RA', 'Santos, GR']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The ecological and economic contributions of pollinator bees to agricultural production have been threatened by the inappropriate and excessive use of pesticides. These pesticides are often applied in areas with ecological peculiarities (e.g., the Neotropical savannah-like region termed as Cerrado) that were not considered during the product development. Here, we conducted field experiments with melon (i.e., Cucumis melo L.) plants cultivated under Brazilian Cerrado conditions and evaluated the impacts of botanical (i.e., neem-based insecticide) and synthetic (i.e., the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil) pesticides on the flower visitation rates of naturally occurring pollinator bees. Our results revealed that both honey bees (i.e., Apis mellifera L) and non-Apis bees visited melon flowers and the intensity of bee visitation was moderately correlated with yield parameters (e.g., number of marketable fruits and fruit yield). Pesticide treatments differentially affected bee species. For instance, Plebeia sp. bees were not affected by any pesticide treatment, whereas both A. mellifera and Halictus sp. bees showed reduced visitation intensity after the application of deltamethrin or neem-based insecticides. Fungicide treatment alone did not influence the bee's visitation intensity. Deltamethrin-treated melon fields produced significantly lighter marketable fruits, and the melon yield was significantly lower in melon fields treated with the neem-based insecticide. Thus, our findings with such pollinator bees reinforce the idea that field applications of botanical pesticides may represent as risky as the applications of synthetic compounds, indicating that these alternative products should be submitted to risk assessments comparable to those required for synthetic products.

Brain morphophysiology of Africanized bee Apis mellifera exposed to sublethal doses of imidacloprid,975,JOUR,"['De Almeida Rossi, C.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'Tavares, D.A.', 'Cintra-Socolowski, P.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Several synthetic substances are used in agricultural areas to combat insect pests; however, the indiscriminate use of these products may affect nontarget insects, such as bees. In Brazil, one of the most widely used insecticides is imidacloprid, which targets the nervous system of insects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the brain of the Africanized Apis mellifera. The organs of both control bees and bees exposed to insecticide were subjected to morphological, histochemical and immunocytochemical analysis after exposure to imidacloprid, respectively, for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. In mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 and in optic lobes of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD 50/10, LD50/100, and LD50/50, we observed the presence of condensed cells. The Feulgen reaction revealed the presence of some cells with pyknotic nuclei, whereas Xylidine Ponceau stain revealed strongly stained cells. These characteristics can indicate the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, cells in mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 appeared to be swollen. Cell death was confirmed by immunocytochemical technique. Therefore, it was concluded that sublethal doses of imidacloprid have cytotoxic effects on exposed bee brains and that optic lobes are more sensitive to the insecticide than other regions of the brain. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2013,10.1007/s00244-013-9897-1,65,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,
Brain transcriptome of honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibiting impaired olfactory learning induced by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid,782,JOUR,"['Li, Z.', 'Yu, T.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Heerman, M.', 'He, J.', 'Huang, J.', 'Nie, H.', 'Su, S.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Declines in honey bee populations represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/μl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.001,156,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,

In social insects, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of reproductives, i.e. males and queens, and efficient collaborative brood care by workers. Therefore, interactive effects between malnutrition and environmental pollution on sperm and feeding glands (hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs)) would provide mechanisms for population declines, unless buffered against due to their fitness relevance. However, while negative effects for bumble bee colony fitness are known, the effects of malnutrition and insecticide exposure singly and in combination on individuals are poorly understood. Here we show, in a fully-crossed laboratory experiment, that malnutrition and insecticide exposure result in neutral or antagonistic interactions for spermatozoa and HPGs of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, suggesting strong selection to buffer key colony fitness components. No significant effects were observed for mortality and consumption, but significant negative effects were revealed for spermatozoa traits and HPGs. The combined effects on these parameters were not higher than the individual stressor effects, which indicates an antagonistic interaction between both. Despite the clear potential for additive effects, due to the individual stressors impairing muscle quality and neurological control, simultaneous malnutrition and insecticide exposure surprisingly did not reveal an increased impact compared to individual stressors, probably due to key fitness traits being resilient. Our data support that stressor interactions require empirical tests on a case-by-case basis and need to be regarded in context to understand underlying mechanisms and so adequately mitigate the ongoing decline of the entomofauna.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155098,833,,0,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens prefer pesticide-contaminated soils when selecting underground hibernation sites,395,JOUR,"['Rondeau, S.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Science of the Total Environment,"New evidence points to substantial impacts of exposure to pesticide residues in soil for a range of bee taxa that have close regular contact with this substrate. Among others, the risk of exposure is high for bumblebee (Bombus spp.) queens hibernating in agricultural soils. An important question is whether bumblebee queens can detect and avoid pesticide-contaminated soils, or whether they might be attracted to such agrochemical residues. To address this question, we performed a multiple-choice preference experiment in which newly emerged bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens were given access to arrays of 36 crates of soil treated with different pesticides in large mesh-covered enclosures. Five of the most commonly encountered pesticides in agricultural soils (boscalid, chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, cyantraniliprole, difenoconazole) were selected for testing at two contamination levels (lower or higher), based on field-realistic exposure estimates. Bumblebee queens consistently avoided hibernating in pesticide-free soil at both contamination levels, while showing no avoidance for any pesticide-treated soil types. At the lower contamination level, queens selected the pesticide-free soil 1.3 to 2.4-fold less frequently on average than any of the spiked soils, while none of the queens from the higher contamination group selected pesticide-free soil. This apparent preference for pesticide-contaminated soils increases the likelihood of exposure to and potential hazard from pesticide residues in soil for bumblebee queens during hibernation, a critical and highly vulnerable period of their annual life cycle. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176534,954,0.0,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.",2017,10.1038/s41598-017-08752-x,7,,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,

However, following chronic pesticide exposure, bees exposed to field-realistic levels learnt more slowly and their short-term memory was significantly impaired following exposure to 2.4 ppb pesticide.

Bumblebees Exposed to a Neonicotinoid Pesticide Make Suboptimal Foraging Decisions,608,JOUR,"['Siviter, H.', 'Johnson, A.K.', 'Muth, F.']",Environmental Entomology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers, but many species are in decline. Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide globally and can have negative sublethal effects on bumblebee colony growth and reproduction. Individual bumblebees can visit hundreds to thousands of flowers a day to forage for their colony. As such, they are a model species for studying optimal foraging, and small impairments to an individual's foraging decisions may have compounding effects on the colony's nutritional intake. We exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, before allowing them to forage on an artificial floral array. We found that neonicotinoid-exposed bumblebees made suboptimal foraging decisions, as they were more likely to visit flowers located further apart than control bees. This indicates that for a given flower patch, individual bees exposed to a neonicotinoid will likely use more energy and forage less efficiency than unexposed bees, although further studies that directly measure energetic cost are required to confirm this. Given the robust and growing body of evidence demonstrating negative sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees, sublethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory within the regulatory process.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Bumblebees are resilient to neonicotinoid-fungicide combinations,425,JOUR,"['Schuhmann, A.', 'Schulte, J.', 'Feldhaar, H.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Environment International,"Bumblebees are among the most important wild bees for pollination of crops and securing wildflower diversity. However, their abundance and diversity have been on a steady decrease in the last decades. One of the most important factors leading to their decline is the frequent use of plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture, which spread into forests and natural reserves. Mixtures of different PPPs pose a particular threat because of possible synergistic effects. While there is a comparatively large body of studies on the effects of PPPs on honeybees, we still lack data on wild bees. We here investigated the influence of the frequent fungicide Cantus® Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and their combination on bumblebees. Cognitive performance and foraging flights of bumblebees were studied. They are essential for the provisioning and survival of the colony. We introduce a novel method for testing four treatments simultaneously on the same colony, minimizing inter-colony differences. For this, we successfully quartered the colony and moved the queen daily between compartments. Bumblebees appeared astonishingly resilient to the PPPs tested or they have developed mechanisms for detoxification. Neither learning capacity nor flight activity were inhibited by treatment with the single PPPs or their combination. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108608,186,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Butenolide Insecticide Flupyradifurone Affects Honey Bee Worker Antiviral Immunity and Survival,583,JOUR,"['Harwood, G.P.', 'Prayugo, V.', 'Dolezal, A.G.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Honey bees face many environmental stressors, including exposure to pesticides and pathogens. A novel butenolide pesticide, flupyradifurone, was recently introduced to the US and shown to have a bee-friendly toxicity profile. Like the much-scrutinized neonicotinoids that preceded it, flupyradifurone targets the insect nervous system. Some neonicotinoids have been shown to interfere with antiviral immunity, which raised the concern that similar effects may be observed with flupyradifurone. In this study, we investigated how flupyradifurone and a neonicotinoid, clothianidin, affect the ability of honey bee workers to combat an infection of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). We exposed workers to field-realistic doses of the pesticides either with or without co-exposure with the virus, and then tracked survival and changes in viral titers. We repeated the experiment in the spring and fall to look for any seasonal effects. We found that flupyradifurone caused elevated mortality in the fall, but it did not lead to increased virus-induced mortality. Flupyradifurone also appeared to affect virus clearance, as bees co-exposed to the pesticide and virus tended to have higher viral titers after 48 hours than those exposed to the virus alone. Clothianidin had no effect on viral titers, and it actually appeared to increase resistance to viral infection in spring bees.

C hronic in-hive exposure to a field-relevant concentration of Closer™ SC (24% sulfoxaflor) insecticide altered immunological and physiological markers of honey bee foragers (Apis mellifera),491,JOUR,"['Ahmed, F.S.', 'Helmy, W.S.', 'El-Din, H.S.', 'Al Naggar, Y.']",Apidologie,"Sulfoxaflor (SULF), a well-known alternative for the banned neonicotinoids, is not environmentally persistent, yet numerous studies using field-realistic levels have demonstrated its detrimental impact on honey bee colonies. Despite this, even just a limited number of studies have addressed its residue-level effects on the physiological and immunological biomarkers of foraging honey bees in semi-field conditions. In the present study, we determined the LT50 of sulfoxaflor (Closer™ 24% SC) on forager bees in the laboratory at concentrations that were 12 to 300,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration. Following that, we exposed bee colonies in a semi-field in-hive experiment for 21 days to a concentration that is 600,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration to assess potential effects on the physiological state of honey bee foragers. To do that, a total of six colonies were treated with Closer™ (0.3 µg a.i./L) or control treatment, and the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glucose oxidase (GOX), and carboxylesterase (CaEs) in head tissues and invertase (IV), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the midgut tissues of forager bees were assessed at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-day post-exposure. The LT50 results for the least and greatest concentrations of Closer™ were 0.37 and 74.3 h, respectively. Furthermore, all measured physiological and immunological biomarkers were negatively impacted in the chronic exposure to 0.3 µg a.i./L concentration of Closer™.

COLONY IMPACT OF PESTICIDE-INDUCED SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON HONEYBEE WORKERS: A SIMULATION STUDY USING BEEHAVE,369,JOUR,"['Thorbek, P', 'Campbell, PJ', 'Thompson, HM']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

Can Costs of Pesticide Exposure for Bumblebees Be Balanced by Benefits from a Mass-Flowering Crop?,300,JOUR,"['Rundlöf, M', 'Lundin, O']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,"Mass-flowering crops provide forage for bees but also contain pesticides. Such pesticide exposure can harm bees, but our understanding of how this cost is balanced by forage benefits is limited. To provide insights into benefits and costs, we placed bumblebee colonies in 18 landscapes with conventional red clover fields treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid (flowers + pesticide), untreated organic red clover fields (flowers), or landscapes lacking clover fields (controls). Colonies grew heavier near thiacloprid-treated clover compared to controls lacking clover, while colonies near untreated clover did not differ from colonies in neither of the other landscape types. Thiacloprid treatment effectively controlled pests and increased bumblebee crop visitation. However, colony production of queens and males did not differ among landscape types. In conclusion, thiacloprid application in clover appears to be of low risk for bumblebees. More generally, neonicotinoids may not be equally harmful when used in flowering crops and effective low-risk pest control in such crops could potentially benefit bumblebees and crop pollination.",2019,10.1021/acs.est.9b02789,53,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

In addition to the adult bees, larvae can be exposed to the insecticide through contaminated floral resources. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible effects of the exposure of A. mellifera larvae to a field concentration of thiamethoxam (0.001 ng/μL thiamethoxam) on larval and pupal survival and on the percentage of adult emergence. Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence. However, this exposure caused ultra-structural alterations in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria. These alterations indicate possible tissue degeneration, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of thiamethoxam in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. Such results suggest cellular organelle impairment that can compromise cellular function of the midgut cells, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells, and, consequently, can compromise the longevity of the bees of the whole colony. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.113,185,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens.

Cell death localization in situ in laboratory reared honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae treated with pesticides,141,JOUR,"['Gregorc, A.', 'Ellis, J.D.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"In this study, cell death detected by DNA fragmentation labeling and phosphatidylserine (PS) localization was investigated in the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) midgut, salivary glands and ovaries after treating larvae with different pesticides offered via an artificial diet. To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ∼10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae. The data suggest that the tested pesticides induced apoptosis in tissues of honey bee larvae at the tested concentrations.

Characterisation of the heat shock protein Tid and its involvement in stress response regulation in Apis cerana,374,JOUR,"['Li, G.', 'Zhang, C.', 'Wang, H.', 'Xia, W.', 'Zhang, X.', 'Liu, Z.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Zhao, H.', 'Xu, B.']",Frontiers in Physiology,"Objective: The impact of various environmental stresses on native Apis cerana cerana fitness has attracted intense attention in China. However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT–PCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40°C to 43°C and 46°C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown. Conclusion: AccTid plays a crucial role in A. cerana cerana stress responses and may mediate oxidative damage caused by various stresses. Our findings will offer fundamental knowledge for further investigations of the defence mechanism of A. cerana cerana against environmental stresses.

Characteristics of AccSTIP1 in Apis cerana cerana and its role during oxidative stress responses,354,JOUR,"['Zhai, N', 'Jia, HH', 'Ma, ML', 'Chao, YZ', 'Guo, XQ', 'Li, H']",CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES,"Various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, heavy metals, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and different pesticides, induce a cellular oxidative stress response. The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 degrees C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees.

In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491 by in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 degrees C), heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and phoxim) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that AccCYP336A1 may play a very significant role in antioxidant defense against ROS damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Chemical Stimulants and Stressors Impact the Outcome of Virus Infection and Immune Gene Expression in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),634,JOUR,"['Parekh, F.', 'Daughenbaugh, K.F.', 'Flenniken, M.L.']",Frontiers in Immunology,"Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are ecologically, agriculturally, and economically important plant pollinators. High average annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US have been partially attributed to agrochemical exposure and virus infections. To examine the potential negative synergistic impacts of agrochemical exposure and virus infection, as well as the potential promise of phytochemicals to ameliorate the impact of pathogenic infections on honey bees, we infected bees with a panel of viruses (i.e., Flock House virus, deformed wing virus, or Sindbis virus) and exposed to one of three chemical compounds. Specifically, honey bees were fed sucrose syrup containing: (1) thyme oil, a phytochemical and putative immune stimulant, (2) fumagillin, a beekeeper applied fungicide, or (3) clothianidin, a grower-applied insecticide. We determined that virus abundance was lower in honey bees fed 0.16 ppm thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup, compared to bees fed sucrose syrup alone. Parallel analysis of honey bee gene expression revealed that honey bees fed thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup had higher expression of key RNAi genes (argonaute-2 and dicer-like), antimicrobial peptide expressing genes (abaecin and hymenoptaecin), and vitellogenin, a putative honey bee health and age indicator, compared to bees fed only sucrose syrup. Virus abundance was higher in bees fed fumagillin (25 ppm or 75 ppm) or 1 ppb clothianidin containing sucrose syrup relative to levels in bees fed only sucrose syrup. Whereas, honey bees fed 10 ppb clothianidin had lower virus levels, likely because consuming a near lethal dose of insecticide made them poor hosts for virus infection. The negative impact of fumagillin and clothianidin on honey bee health was indicated by the lower expression of argonaute-2, dicer-like, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin, and vitellogenin. Together, these results indicate that chemical stimulants and stressors impact the outcome of virus infection and immune gene expression in honey bees.

Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application.

We recorded individual foraging at artificial food patches during one-hour-long trials and then compared several foraging-related measures between differently dosed individuals. We found that 75.12% of the total syrup consumption occurred at the first-exploited patch, but individuals did not exhibit any bias toward pesticide-treated food patches. Chronic exposure to acetamiprid had little effect on individual foraging decisions at the first-exploited food patch but significantly affected the time to the first feeding and the number of feedings at the second-exploited patch in interaction with body mass. The duration of the first feeding was affected only by foragers' body mass. Our finding indicates that chronic exposure to a high but field-realistic concentration of acetamiprid may alter some aspects of bumblebees' foraging behaviour. If such behavioural changes accumulate during consecutive foraging bouts, chronic exposure to this pesticide might lead to a reduction of daily resource collection, ultimately jeopardising colony fitness or plant (crop) pollination. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Chronic contact with imidacloprid during development may decrease female solitary bee foraging ability and increase male competitive ability for mates,635,JOUR,"['Anderson, N.L.', 'Harmon-Threatt, A.N.']",Chemosphere,"Environmentally persistent xenobiotics, such as neonicotinoid insecticides, are thought to contribute to insect declines. Much of what is known about the non-target effects on bees comes from oral exposure in eusocial species. However, most bee species are solitary and nest below ground. For them, contaminated nesting resources may represent an important, yet understudied, route of exposure. We examined the effect of chronic contact exposure with realistic soil concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (0, 7.5, 15, or 100 ppb) during immature development on adult locomotion (movement speed and distance) and brain development of the solitary bees Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata. Adult locomotion and mushroom body morphology were characterized 2 (females) or 4 (males) and 14 (both sexes) days after emergence. Unlike the 0 and 7.5 ppb groups, female O. lignaria treated with 15 and 100 ppb did not move faster with age. If movement speed is associated with foraging or nest-building ability, this could result in a 25% reduction in nest provisioning efficiency over the first 14 days. Young male M. rotundata moved more quickly (7.5 and 100 ppb) and farther (100 ppb) when treated with imidacloprid, potentially increasing their ability to compete for more receptive female bees. We did not detect an effect of imidacloprid on the relative volumes of the neuropil and Kenyon cell subregions. We discuss how an environmentally persistent xenobiotic has the potential to alter population dynamics through changes in adult locomotion, even in the absence of a detectable effect on gross brain morphology. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131177,283,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,,

Much of the previous research on the effects of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticide that has gained attention for non-target effects, on bees focused on the consumption of contaminated food resources by a limited number of eusocial species. However, neonicotinoids are known to accumulate and persist in soils at concentrations 2 to 60 times greater than in food resources, and may represent an important route of exposure for diverse and ecologically important ground-nesting bees. This study aimed to assess the effect of chronic contact exposure to realistic soil concentrations of imidacloprid, the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticide, on bee longevity, development speed, and body mass. Cohorts of Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata were used as proxies for ground-nesting species. We observed species- and sex-specific changes to adult longevity, development speed, and mass in response to increasing concentrations of imidacloprid. These results suggest that chronic exposure to nesting substrates contaminated with neonicotinoids may represent an important route of exposure that could have considerable physiological and ecological consequences for bees and plant-pollinator interactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,10.1038/s41598-019-40031-9,9,1.0,0,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,
Chronic exposure of bumblebees to neonicotinoid imidacloprid suppresses the entire mevalonate pathway and fatty acid synthesis,274,JOUR,"['Erban, T', 'Sopko, B', 'Talacko, P', 'Harant, K', 'Kadlikova, K', 'Halesova, T', 'Riddellova, K', 'Pekas, A']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS,"Determining the side effects of pesticides on pollinators is an important topic due to the increasing loss of pollinators. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid.

These treatments overlapped the residue levels found in pollen and nectar of many crops and landscape plants, which have higher residue levels than seed-treated crops (less than 10 ppb, corn, canola and sunflower). At 6 weeks, queen mortality was significantly higher in 50 ppb and 100 ppb and by 11 weeks in 20 ppb-100 ppb neonicotinyl-treated colonies. The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37% I, 56% C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears that only a few workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest. The majority of the workers sat immobilized for weeks on the floor of the flight box without moving to fed at sugar syrup feeders. Neonicotinyl residues were lower in wax pots in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided. At 10 (14) ppb I and 50 (39) ppb C, fewer males were produced by the workers, but queens continued to invest in queen production which was similar among treatments. Feeding on imidacloprid and clothianidin can cause changes in behavior (reduced worker movement, consumption, wax pot production, and nectar storage) that result in detrimental effects on colonies (queen survival and colony weight).

Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid increases expression of antimicrobial peptide genes in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens,883,JOUR,"['Simmons, W.R.', 'Angelini, D.R.']",Scientific Reports,"Bumblebees are important pollinators in wild and agricultural settings. In recent decades pollinator declines have been linked to the effects of increased pesticide use and the spread of disease. Synergy between these factors has been suggested, but no physiological mechanism has been identified. This study examines the connection between neonicotinoid exposure and innate immune function in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens, which is an important wild and commercial pollinator in eastern North America. Experimental colonies in the field were enclosed and provided pollen and sugar syrup containing an agriculturally relevant range of imidacloprid concentrations. Bumblebees were collected from colonies over four weeks, and the expression of antimicrobial peptides was measured using multiplex quantitative real time PCR. Significant increases in the expression of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptaecin were found over time in treatments receiving moderate to high concentrations of the pesticide. Responses were dependent on time of exposure and dose. These results indicate that immune function in bumblebees is affected by neonicotinoid exposure and suggest a physiological mechanism by which neonicotinoids may impact the innate immune function of bumblebee pollinators in wild and agricultural habitats. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,10.1038/srep44773,7,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide alters the interactions between bumblebees and wild plants,123,JOUR,"['Stanley, DA', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.",2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12644,30,0.0,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide and a synthetic pyrethroid in full-sized honey bee colonies,715,JOUR,"['Odemer, R.', 'Rosenkranz, P.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"In the last decade, the use of neonicotinoid insecticides increased significantly in the agricultural landscape and they are meanwhile considered a risk to honey bees. Besides the exposure to pesticides, colonies are treated frequently with various acaricides that beekeepers are forced to use against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Here we have analyzed the impact of chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of the common neonicotinoid thiacloprid (T) and the widely used acaricide τ-fluvalinate (synthetic pyrethroid, F) - applied alone or in combination - to honey bee colonies under field conditions. Thiacloprid was administered in sugar syrup at a concentration of 2 mg/kg and in a frequency of 1 kg per week, no pollen was provided in addition. All colonies were kept on an organic farm and they were free to forage. The population dynamics of bees and brood were assessed in all colonies according to the Liebefeld method. Four groups (T, F, F + T, control) with 8-9 colonies each were analyzed in two independent replications, each lasting from spring/summer until spring of the consecutive year. In late autumn, all colonies were treated with oxalic acid against Varroosis. Under these specific conditions and with the doses tested, we could not find a negative impact of the chronic neonicotinoid exposure on the population dynamics or overwintering success of the colonies, irrespective of whether applied alone or in combination with τ-fluvalinate. © 2019, © 2019 International Bee Research Association.",2020,10.1080/00218839.2019.1675337,59,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Chronic exposure to field-realistic doses of imidacloprid resulted in biphasic negative effects on honey bee physiology,557,JOUR,"['Kim, S.', 'Kim, J.H.', 'Cho, S.', 'Lee, D.E.', 'Clark, J.M.', 'Lee, S.H.']",Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"There have been many investigations on the negative effects of imidacloprid (IMD) on honey bees. IMD is known to disrupt honey bee physiology and colony health at a relatively low concentration compared to other pesticides. In this study, honey bee colonies were chronically exposed to field-realistic concentrations (5, 20, and 100 ppb) of IMD, and the body weight, flight performance, carbohydrate reserve, and lipid contents of forager bees analyzed. Transcriptome analyses followed by quantitative PCR were also conducted for both nurse and forager bees to elucidate any changes in energy metabolism related to phenotypic disorders. The body weights of newly emerged and nurse bees showed decreasing tendencies as the IMD concentration increased. In forager bees, however, IMD induced a biphasic change in body weight: body weight was decreased at the lower concentrations (5 and 20 ppb) but increased at the higher concentration (100 ppb). Nevertheless, the flight capability of forager bees significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of IMD on target gene transcription in forager bees showed biphasic patterns between low (5 and 20 ppb) and high (100 ppb) concentrations. Nurse bees showed typical features of premature transition to foragers in a concentration-dependent manner. When exposed to low concentrations, forager bees exhibited downregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, upregulation of transporter activity, and a dose-dependent body weight reduction, which were similar to insulin resistance and diabetic symptoms. However, increased lipid metabolism and decreased energy metabolism with body weight gain were observed at high IMD concentration. Considered together, these results suggest that field-realistic doses of IMD alter honey bee energy metabolism in distinctly different ways at low and high concentrations, both of which negatively affect honey bee colony health. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.103759,144,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,
Chronic exposure to imidacloprid or thiamethoxam neonicotinoid causes oxidative damages and alters carotenoid-retinoid levels in caged honey bees (Apis mellifera),50,JOUR,"['Gauthier, M.', 'Aras, P.', 'Paquin, J.', 'Boily, M.']",Scientific Reports,"Over the last decade, the persistent dwindling of the populations of honey bees has become a growing concern. While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid – IMI or thiamethoxam – THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), α-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (α-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin) and α-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees. This would merit further investigation as these compounds are important in various aspects of bees’ health.

Chronic exposure to insecticides impairs honeybee optomotor behaviour,605,JOUR,"['Parkinson, R.H.', 'Fecher, C.', 'Gray, J.R.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Honeybees use wide-field visual motion information to calculate the distance they have flown from the hive, and this information is communicated to conspecifics during the waggle dance. Seed treatment insecticides, including neonicotinoids and novel insecticides like sulfoxaflor, display detrimental effects on wild and managed bees, even when present at sublethal quantities. These effects include deficits in flight navigation and homing ability, and decreased survival of exposed worker bees. Neonicotinoid insecticides disrupt visual motion detection in the locust, resulting in impaired escape behaviors, but it had not previously been shown whether seed treatment insecticides disrupt wide-field motion detection in the honeybee. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to two commonly used insecticides, imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and sulfoxaflor, results in impaired optomotor behavior in the honeybee. This behavioral effect correlates with altered stress and detoxification gene expression in the brain. Exposure to sulfoxaflor led to sparse increases in neuronal apoptosis, localized primarily in the optic lobes, however there was no effect of imidacloprid. We propose that exposure to cholinergic insecticides disrupts the honeybee’s ability to accurately encode wide-field visual motion, resulting in impaired optomotor behaviors. These findings provide a novel explanation for previously described effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on navigation and link these effects to sulfoxaflor for which there is a gap in scientific knowledge.

The contribution of the neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., clothianidin and imidacloprid) to this decline is controversial, and key to understanding their risk is whether the astonishingly low levels found in the nectar and pollen of plants is sufficient to deliver neuroactive levels to their site of action: the bee brain. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) fed field levels [10 nM, 2.1 ppb (w/w)] of neonicotinoid accumulate between 4 and 10 nM in their brains within 3 days. Acute (minutes) exposure of cultured neurons to 10 nM clothianidin, but not imidacloprid, causes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent rapid mitochondrial depolarization. However, a chronic (2 days) exposure to 1 nM imidacloprid leads to a receptor-dependent increased sensitivity to a normally innocuous level of acetylcholine, which now also causes rapid mitochondrial depolarization in neurons. Finally, colonies exposed to this level of imidacloprid show deficits in colony growth and nest condition compared with untreated colonies.

Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time. We also discovered that the acute toxicity of neonicotinoids to honey bees doubles in the presence of a commonly encountered fungicide.

During winter, honey bee colonies rely on stored honey and beebread, which is frequently contaminated with the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. To determine whether neonicotinoid exposure affects overwinter survival of Apis mellifera L., we chronically exposed overwintering field colonies and winter workers in the laboratory to thiamethoxam or clothianidin at different concentrations and monitored survival and feed consumption. We also investigated the sublethal effects of chronic thiamethoxam exposure on colony pathogen load, queen quality, and colony temperature regulation. Under field conditions, high doses of thiamethoxam significantly increased overwinter mortality compared to controls, with field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam showing no significant effect on colony overwinter survival. Under laboratory conditions, chronic neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreased survival of winter workers relative to negative control at all doses tested. Chronic high-dose thiamethoxam exposure was not shown to impact pathogen load or queen quality, and field-realistic concentrations of thiamethoxam did not affect colony temperature homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic environmental neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreases survival of winter workers in the laboratory, but only chronic high-dose thiamethoxam significantly decreases overwinter survival of colonies in the field. © 2019 by the authors.

Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure,10,JOUR,"['Gill, RJ', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""fec12292-list-0001""> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",2014,10.1111/1365-2435.12292,28,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
"Chronic larval exposure to thiacloprid impairs honeybee antennal selectivity, learning and memory performances",531,JOUR,"['Ke, L.', 'Chen, X.', 'Dai, P.', 'Liu, Y.-J.']",Frontiers in Physiology,"The use of agricultural neonicotinoid insecticides has sub-lethal chronic effects on bees that are more prevalent than acute toxicity. Among these insecticides, thiacloprid, a commonly used compound with low toxicity, has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on the olfactory and learning abilities of honeybees. The effect of sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid on the antennal activity of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, laboratory-based experiments were conducted in which honeybee larvae were administered thiacloprid (0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L). Using electroantennography (EAG), the impacts of thiacloprid exposure on the antennal selectivity to common floral volatiles were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of sub-lethal exposure on odor-related learning and memory were also assessed. The results of this study reveal, for the first time, that sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid decreased honeybee antenna EAG responses to floral scents, leading to increased olfactory selectivity in the high-dose (1.0 mg/L) group compared to the control group (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.042). The results also suggest that thiacloprid negatively affected odor-associated paired learning acquisition, as well as medium-term (1 h) (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.019) and long-term memory (24 h) (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.037) in adult honeybees. EAG amplitudes were dramatically reduced following R-linalool paired olfactory training (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.001; 0 mg/L vs. 0.5 mg/L: p = 0.027), while antennal activities only differed significantly in the control between paired and unpaired groups. Our results indicated that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid may affect olfactory perception and learning and memory behaviors in honeybees. These findings have important implications for the safe use of agrochemicals in the environment.

Chronic neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and parasite stress differentially affects learning in honeybees and bumblebees,181,JOUR,"['Piiroinen, S', 'Goulson, D']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Learning and memory are crucial functions which enable insect pollinators to efficiently locate and extract floral rewards. Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to field realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others. This has important implications for regulatory risk assessments which generally use honeybees as a model for all bees.",2016,10.1098/rspb.2016.0246,283,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Chronic oral exposure to field-realistic pesticide combinations via pollen and nectar: effects on feeding and thermal performance in a solitary bee,761,JOUR,"['Azpiazu, C.', 'Bosch, J.', 'Viñuela, E.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Teper, D.', 'Sgolastra, F.']",Scientific Reports,"Pesticide use is one of the main causes of pollinator declines in agricultural ecosystems. Traditionally, most laboratory studies on bee ecotoxicology test acute exposure to single compounds. However, under field conditions, bees are often chronically exposed to a variety of chemicals, with potential synergistic effects. We studied the effects of field-realistic concentrations of three pesticides measured in pollen and nectar of commercial melon fields on the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We orally exposed females of this species throughout their life span to 8 treatments combining two neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid) and a triazole fungicide (myclobutanil) via pollen and sugar syrup. We measured pollen and syrup consumption, longevity, ovary maturation and thermogenesis. Pesticide intake was three orders of magnitude higher via syrup than pollen. At the tested concentrations, no synergistic effects emerged, and we found no effects on longevity and ovary maturation. However, all treatments containing imidacloprid resulted in suppressed syrup consumption and drastic decreases in thoracic temperature and bee activity. Our results have important implications for pesticide regulation. If we had measured only lethal effects we would have wrongly concluded that the pesticide combinations containing imidacloprid were safe to O. bicornis. The incorporation of tests specifically intended to detect sublethal effects in bee risk assessment schemes should be an urgent priority. In this way, the effects of pesticide exposure on the dynamics of bee populations in agroecosystems will be better assessed. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,10.1038/s41598-019-50255-4,9,,0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Hence honey bees are often exposed to these pesticides. But until now, the effects of theses combinations at field-realistic doses on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE. These results show that chronic combined exposure to pesticides of relatively low toxicity may caused severely physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the honey bees. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02030-4,28,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
"Chronic toxicity of clothianidin, imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, and dimethoate to Apis mellifera L. larvae reared in vitro",778,JOUR,"['Dai, P.', 'Jack, C.J.', 'Mortensen, A.N.', 'Bustamante, T.A.', 'Bloomquist, J.R.', 'Ellis, J.D.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: The effects of chronic exposure to two neonicotinoids (clothianidin and imidacloprid) and two organophosphates (chlorpyrifos and dimethoate) on survival, developmental rate and larval weight of honey bee larvae reared in vitro were determined. Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS: Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L−1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L−1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L−1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L−1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control. A significant decrease in survival, relative to the solvent control, occurred in the 0.8, 1.2 and 8 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos, 0.4, 2 and 10 mg L−1 clothianidin, and 45 mg L−1 dimethoate diets, but not the imidacloprid diets. CONCLUSION: The treatment of larval diets with clothianidin, dimethoate and imidacloprid did not affect survival, developmental rate, or weight of immature honey bees; however, treatment with chlorpyrifos did.

Chronic within-hive video recordings detect altered nursing behaviour and retarded larval development of neonicotinoid treated honey bees,680,JOUR,"['Siefert, P.', 'Hota, R.', 'Ramesh, V.', 'Grünewald, B.']",Scientific Reports,"Risk evaluations for agricultural chemicals are necessary to preserve healthy populations of honey bee colonies. Field studies on whole colonies are limited in behavioural research, while results from lab studies allow only restricted conclusions on whole colony impacts. Methods for automated long-term investigations of behaviours within comb cells, such as brood care, were hitherto missing. In the present study, we demonstrate an innovative video method that enables within-cell analysis in honey bee (Apis mellifera) observation hives to detect chronic sublethal neonicotinoid effects of clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) and thiacloprid (200 ppb) on worker behaviour and development. In May and June, colonies which were fed 10 ppb clothianidin and 200 ppb thiacloprid in syrup over three weeks showed reduced feeding visits and duration throughout various larval development days (LDDs). On LDD 6 (capping day) total feeding duration did not differ between treatments. Behavioural adaptation was exhibited by nurses in the treatment groups in response to retarded larval development by increasing the overall feeding timespan. Using our machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate a novel method for detecting behaviours in an intact hive that can be applied in a versatile manner to conduct impact analyses of chemicals, pests and other stressors. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1038/s41598-020-65425-y,10,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,

Among the main drivers of diminishing bee populations is the widespread use of agrochemicals. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the foraging dynamics of bees at agrochemical-contaminated areas, it is essential to consider both environmental conditions and the specific foraging ecology of bee species. For the first time, we conducted a semi-field study to investigate whether stingless bees exhibit a preference for food contaminated with agrochemicals compared to non- contaminated food, under natural weather conditions. Colonies of Plebeia lucii Moure, 2004 were placed in a greenhouse and subjected to a preference test, where bees were given the freedom to choose between contaminated or non-contaminated food sources following a preliminary training period. Within the greenhouse, we placed feeders containing realistic concentrations of an insecticide (acephate: 2 mg a.i./L), a herbicide (glyphosate: 31.3 mg a.i./L), or a mixture of both, alongside non- contaminated food. Environmental variables (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) were monitored throughout the experiment. At higher temperatures, the foragers preferred food containing the mixture of both agrochemicals or uncontaminated food over the other treatments. At lower temperatures, by contrast, the bees preferred food laced with a single agrochemical (acephate or glyphosate) over uncontaminated food or the agrochemical mixture. Our findings indicate that agrochemical residues in nectar pose a significant threat to P. lucii colonies, as foragers do not actively avoid contaminated food, despite the detrimental effects of acephate and glyphosate on bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even minor, natural fluctuations in environmental conditions can alter the colony exposure risk. Despite the interplay between temperature and bees' preference for contaminated food, foragers consistently collected contaminated food containing both agrochemicals, whether isolated or in combination, throughout the whole experiment.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175892,952,,0,,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

We fed beehives with different food sources and exposed the bees to sublethal doses of thiacloprid. After that three different types of honey and pollen were offered in separate choice assays and behaviour towards food was recorded. Thiacloprid significantly affected the food choice in the honey assay, increasing the bees' preference of polyfloral honey, while pre-pesticide diet had no influence. The pollen choice remained similar regardless of treatments, as bees always preferred polyfloral pollen. Interestingly, pesticide exposure affected bee mobility differently, depending on the previous diet.

Trade-offs between longevity and other traits may render long-living workers in brood-free periods more susceptible to pesticides compared to short-lived ones. Further, colony environment (e.g., adequate nutrition) may enable workers to better cope with pesticides, yet data comparing long vs. short-living workers and the role of the colony environment for pesticide tolerance are scarce. Here, we show that long-living honey bee workers, Apis mellifera, are less susceptible to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam than short-lived workers, and that susceptibility was further reduced when workers were acclimatized under colony compared to laboratory conditions. Following an OECD protocol, freshly-emerged workers were exposed to thiamethoxam in summer and winter and either acclimatized within their colony or in the laboratory. Mortality and sucrose consumption were measured daily and revealed that winter workers were significantly less susceptible than summer workers, despite being exposed to higher thiamethoxam dosages due to increased food consumption. Disparencies in fat body activity, which is key for detoxification, may explain why winter bees were less susceptible. Furthermore, colony acclimatization significantly reduced susceptibility towards thiamethoxam in winter workers likely due to enhanced protein nutrition. Brood absence and colony environment seem to govern workers’ ability to cope with pesticides, which should be considered in risk assessments. Since honey bee colony losses occur mostly over winter, long-term studies assessing the effects of pesticide exposure on winter bees are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02758-8,33,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Colony size is a key ecological trait predicted to drive sensitivity to environmental stressors and may be especially important for species with annual cycles of sociality, such as bumblebees. However, there is limited empirical evidence assessing the effect of colony size on sensitivity to environmental stressors or the mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we examine the relationship between colony size and sensitivity to environmental stressors in bumblebees. We exposed colonies at different developmental stages briefly (2 days) to a common neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and cold stress, while quantifying behaviour of individuals. Combined imidacloprid and cold exposure had stronger effects on both thermoregulatory behaviour and long-term colony growth in small colonies. We find that imidacloprid's effects on behaviour are mediated by body temperature and spatial location within the nest, suggesting that social thermoregulation provides a buffering effect in large colonies. Finally, we demonstrate qualitatively similar effects in size-manipulated microcolonies, suggesting that group size per se, rather than colony age, drives these patterns. Our results provide evidence that colony size is critical in driving sensitivity to stressors and may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the complex and context-specific impacts of pesticide exposure.",2023,10.1098/rspb.2023.0555,290,,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

Several of these molecules are toxic to non-target organisms such as pollinators and their lethal dose can be lowered if applied as a mixture.

The present work aimed at understanding the synergistic effects on honeybees of a combined inhive exposure to sublethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide penconazole. A multidisciplinary approach was used: honeybee mortality upon exposure was initially tested in cage, and the colonies development monitored. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses via light and transmission electron microscopy were carried out on the gut of larvae and forager honeybees. Moreover, the main pollen foraging sources and the fungal gut microbiota were studied using Next Generation Sequencing; the gut core bacterial taxa were quantified via qPCR. The mortality test showed a negative effect on honeybee survival when exposed to agrochemicals and their mixture in cage but not confirmed at colony level. Microscopy analyses on the gut epithelium indicated no appreciable morphological changes in larvae, newly emerged and forager honeybees exposed in field to the agrochemicals. Nevertheless, the gut microbial profile showed a reduction of Bombilactobacillus and an increase of Lactobacillus and total fungi upon mixture application. Finally, we highlighted for the first time a significant honeybee diet change after pesticide exposure: penconazole, alone or in mixture, significantly altered the pollen foraging preference, with honeybees preferring Hedera pollen. Overall, our inhive results showed no severe effects upon administration of sublethal doses of thiacloprid and penconazole but indicate a change in honeybees foraging preference.

In this study, we used a full-factorial design to examine the main and interactive effects of three insecticide formulations with different modes of action (Mospilan 20 SP, Sherpa 100 EC, and Dursban 480 EC) on bee biochemical processes. We measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) activities, as well as a nonenzymatic biomarker associated with energy metabolism, i.e., ATP level. All studied endpoints were affected by Sherpa 100 EC, and the activities of AChE and EST as well as ATP levels were affected by Dursban 480 EC. Moreover, complex interactions between all three insecticides affected ATP levels, showing outcomes that cannot be predicted when testing each insecticide separately.

In this paper, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis to environmentally realistic levels of clothianidin (neonicotinoid insecticide) and propiconazole (fungicide), singly and in combination. The amount of feeding solution consumed was highest in bees exposed to the neonicotinoid, and lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Ovary maturation and longevity of bees of the neonicotinoid and the fungicide treatments did not differ from those of control bees. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed slow ovary maturation and decreased longevity. We found a synergistic interaction between the neonicotinoid and the fungicide on survival probability. We also found an interaction between treatment and emergence time (an indicator of physiological condition) on longevity. Longevity was negatively correlated to physiological condition only in the fungicide and the mixture treatments.

Early physiological changes were observed on queens, particularly the increase of enzyme activities (catalase [CAT] and glutathione-S-transferase [GST] in the heads) related to protective responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress against pesticide and parasite alone or combined. Stressors also alter the activity of two other enzymes (carboxylesterase alpha [CaE α] and carboxylesterase para [CaE p] in the midguts) involved in metabolic and detoxification functions. Furthermore, single and combined effects of pesticide and parasite decrease survivorship of queens introduced into mating hives for three months.

Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees,112,JOUR,"['Gill, RJ', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, O', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production(1-3). Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.",2012,10.1038/nature11585,491,,0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

Our findings reveal that individual acute oral treatments with pesticides, specifically 20 μL of 10 ng/g imidacloprid (0.2 ng per bee), 30 ng/g chlorpyrifos (0.6 ng per bee), and 60 ng/g glyphosate (1.2 ng per bee), did not impact the flight capability of the bees. However, when bees were exposed to a combination of two or three pesticides, a notable reduction in flight duration and distance was observed. In the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified 307 transcripts and 17 metabolites that exhibited differential expression following exposure to combined pesticides, primarily associated with metabolic pathways involved in energy regulation. Our results illuminate the intricate effects and potential hazards posed by combined pesticide exposures on bee behavior. These findings offer valuable insights into the synergistic potential of pesticide combinations and their capacity to impair bee behavior. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for comprehending the broader consequences of pesticide formulations on honey bee populations. © 2024",2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105793,201,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Chronic exposure to carbaryl caused transcriptional disorders associated with oxidative stress. In addition, a series of metabolic homeostasis were disrupted by carbaryl stress, such amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. The activities of enzymic biomarkers including GST, P450, CAT, AChE and SOD were not influenced by ACE stress, while the CR exposure slightly decreased the activity of CAT and SOD.

Comparative Toxicities and Synergism of Apple Orchard Pesticides to Apis mellifera (L.) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski),972,JOUR,"['Biddinger, D.J.', 'Robertson, J.L.', 'Mullin, C.', 'Frazier, J.', 'Ashcraft, S.A.', 'Rajotte, E.G.', 'Joshi, N.K.', 'Vaughn, M.']",PLoS ONE,"The topical toxicities of five commercial grade pesticides commonly sprayed in apple orchards were estimated on adult worker honey bees, Apis mellifera (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30SG), λ-cyhalothrin (Warrior II), dimethoate (Dimethoate 4EC), phosmet (Imidan 70W), and imidacloprid (Provado 1.6F). At least 5 doses of each chemical, diluted in distilled water, were applied to freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was imidacloprid, λ-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, phosmet, and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was dimethoate, λ-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide fenbuconazole (Indar 2F) was also tested in a 1:1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture, the interaction of fenbuconazole (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide. Our results clearly show that responses of A. mellifera cannot be extrapolated to responses of O.cornifrons, and that synergism of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides occurs using formulated product in mixtures as they are commonly applied in apple orchards. © 2013 Biddinger et al.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0072587,8,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comparative chronic toxicity of three neonicotinoids on New Zealand packaged honey bees,503,CONF,"['Wood, SC', 'Kozii, IV', 'Koziy, RV', 'Epp, T', 'Simko, E']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES,"Background Thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid are the most commonly used neonicotinoid insecticides on the Canadian prairies. There is widespread contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoids, at concentrations which are sublethal for honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus). Objective We compared the effects of chronic, sublethal exposure to the three most commonly used neonicotinoids on honey bee colonies established from New Zealand packaged bees using colony weight gain, brood area, and population size as measures of colony performance. Methods From May 7 to July 29, 2016 (12 weeks), sixty-eight colonies received weekly feedings of sugar syrup and pollen patties containing 0 nM, 20 nM (median environmental dose), or 80 nM (high environmental dose) of one of three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid). Colonies were weighed at three-week intervals. Brood area and population size were determined from digital images of colonies at week 12. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and mixed models. Results There was a significant negative effect (-30%, p<0.01) on colony weight gain (honey production) after 9 and 12 weeks of exposure to 80 nM of thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or imidacloprid and on bee cluster size (-21%, p<0.05) after 12 weeks. Analysis of brood area and number of adult bees lacked adequate (>80%) statistical power to detect an effect. Conclusions Chronic exposure of honey bees to high environmental doses of neonicotinoids has negative effects on honey production. Brood area appears to be less sensitive to detect sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. © 2018 Wood et al.

Comparative ecotoxicity of insecticides with different modes of action to Osmia excavata (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),42,JOUR,"['Song, Y.', 'Li, L.', 'Li, C.', 'Lu, Z.', 'Ouyang, F.', 'Liu, L.', 'Yu, Y.', 'Men, X.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Osmia excavata is an important pollinator in commercial fruit orchards. Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006–0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003–0.0006) μg active ingredient (a.i.) bee−1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata. Our results provided important evidences for selecting appropriate insecticides for use in fruit orchards. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112015,212,,0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

We investigated the susceptibility of Tetragonisca fiebrigi to sublethal concentrations of insecticides fipronil, malathion, and thiamethoxam (administered through contact and ingestion) by determining the LC50 values after 24 hours of exposure and analyzing changes in the activity of esterase isoenzymes and the chromatin in brain cells. The LC50 values showed that all three insecticides were highly toxic through contact and ingestion. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the relative EST-4 (carboxylesterase) activity in T. fiebrigi was partially inhibited by malathion and fipronil ingestion. Moreover, the EST-4 band intensity was increased following high-concentration thiamethoxam (contact) exposure, indicating the increased relative activity of this isoenzyme to detoxify the compound. In the cytochemical analysis of brain cells, the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) points for the control stingless bees and malathion ingestion-exposed and thiamethoxam-exposed (contact and ingestion) stingless bees were in the range of 0.20-0.30 M MgCl2, whereas that for malathion contact-exposed bees was 0.15 M MgCl2, indicating chromatin relaxation and suggesting an increase in gene expression. In conclusion, T. fiebrigi stingless bees are susceptible to the insecticides tested, and the parameters analyzed may be used as biomarkers to detect the presence of these compounds. © 2022, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

Furthermore, contamination of bee flora with insecticide residue is another cause of honeybee mortality. The current study assessed the toxicity of five insecticides, namely bifenthrin (Talstar (R) 10EC), endosulfan (Thiodon (R) 35EC), imidacloprid (Confidor (R) 200SL), ethofenprox (Trebon (R) 30EC) and diafenthiuron (Polo (R) 500SC) against haemocytes of the honeybee, A. mellifera under standard laboratory conditions. Analysis for counts of total haemocytes, differential haemocytes, and abnormalities was determined for larvae, pupae, and adult worker bees of A. mellifera. The haemolymph samples were assessed soon after, 30 and 60 min for selected insecticides applied at a concentration of recommended field doses. The total count of haemocytes was found to be significantly maximum in larval and pupal stages (35818 cells/mm(3), 3387 cells/mm(3)) while lowest (5493 cells/mm(3)) in adult workers, but differential counts of haemocytes remained somewhat insignificant for all insecticides applied. Variation of total haemocytes count of honeybee resulted for all tested insecticides. Results revealed an increase in haemocytes count (6662 cells/mm(3), 7237 cells/mm(3), 7081 cells/mm(3)) of adult honeybees exposed to diafenthiuron, ethofenprox, and imidacloprid soon after application; however, these counts dropped (4506 cells/mm(3), 4262 cells/mm(3), 3481 cells/mm(3), 4325 cells/mm(3)) after sixty minutes of application for all tested insecticides except for bifenthrin when compared with the untreated adult honeybee. While for differential count, granulocytes and plasmatocyte numbers increased in adult worker A. mellifera after the application of insecticides. Haemocytes immune response to insecticides exhibited abnormalities of various degrees, such as denucleation, cell shape distortion and agglutination. The findings indicate that insecticides influence the immunity of A. mellifera by altering of total and differential count of haemocytes, possibly leading to increased mortality and loss of the colony.",2024,10.1007/s42690-024-01358-7,,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,
Comparative toxicity of pesticides and environmental contaminants in bees: Are honey bees a useful proxy for wild bee species?,881,JOUR,"['Heard, M.S.', 'Baas, J.', 'Dorne, J.-L.', 'Lahive, E.', 'Robinson, A.G.', 'Rortais, A.', 'Spurgeon, D.J.', 'Svendsen, C.', 'Hesketh, H.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Threats to wild and managed insect pollinators in Europe are cause for both ecological and socio-economic concern. Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‘indicator’ species for ‘standard’ ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (< 2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (> 25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2017,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.180,578,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,

However, studies comparing the toxicity of pesticides to different individuals and species are lacking, making it difficult to evaluate their short- and long-term effects on colonies and populations of these insects. In this work, we tested the lethality of compounds from the main pesticide groups on stingless bees of the species Melipona beecheii Bennett, Trigona nigra Provancher, and Nannotrigona perilampoides Cresson. The LD50 (in micrograms per bee) for each pesticide was calculated for callow workers and foragers of the three species as well as for gynes and drones of M. beecheii. The results showed that all species were highly susceptible to the evaluated compounds. Nicotinoid pesticides were the most toxic, followed in descending order by permethrin, diazinon, and methomyl. We found evidence of a relationship between the body weight of the species and their LD50 for permethrin and methomyl (r = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively) but not for diazinon (r = -0.089). An analysis of contingency tables showed that within each species, callow workers had higher mortalities than foragers (P < 0.01). In M. beecheii at similar pesticide dose more males died compared with females [χ(0.01),1 = 10.16]. However, gynes were less resistant than workers [χ(0.01),1 = 8.11]. The potential negative consequences of pesticides to native stingless bees are discussed considering the reproductive biology of these insects.

The acute contact and oral toxicity of commercial formulations of deltamethrin 2.5 EC, thiamethoxam 25 WG and acetamiprid 20 SL to Apis mellifera subsp. lamarckii Cockerell 1906 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers were measured by three exposure methods (contact by a 1-µL droplet on thorax, contact by Potter spray tower and oral ingestion). Potter tower exposure gave significantly higher mortality at lower concentration of deltamethrin than contact exposure by single droplet on thorax. Thiamethoxam showed significantly higher mortality through oral exposure at all concentrations. HQoral values were also calculated. Acetamiprid did not give more than 50% mortality even with the highest concentration. Potter tower produced fine droplets (0.286±0.071 µm) and a total of 0.829 µL was deposited on a single honeybee.

Existing mixture toxicity modelling approaches, such as the models of concentration addition and independent action and the mechanistic DEBtox framework have been previously shown as valuable tools for understanding and ultimately predicting joint toxicity. Here we apply these mixture models to investigate the potential to interpret the effects of semi-chronic binary mixture exposure for three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis within potentiation and mixture toxicity experiments. In the potentiation studies, the effect of the insecticide dimethoate with added propiconazole fungicide and neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin with added tau-fluvalinate pyrethroid acari-cide showed no difference in toxicity compared to the single chemical alone. Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of exposures to multiple chemicals, there is an urgent need to consider mixture effects in pollinator risk assessments. Our analyses suggest that current models, particularly those that utilise time-series data, such as DEBtox, can be used to identify additivity as the dominant response pattern and also those examples of interactions, even when small-scale, that may need to be taken into account during risk assessment. © 2017 Robinson et al.

Evaluating the exposure and responses of different bee species to plant protection products is considered an essential part of their risk assessment. This study was conducted to assess the impacts of thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) in a worst-case scenario under semi-field conditions. Bumblebee colonies or solitary bee trap nests were confined in tunnels with flowering oilseed rape. The recommended maximum application rates of 72 g thiacloprid/ha and 675 g prochloraz/ha were applied as a tank mixture during bee flight in full flowering oilseed rape. Several parameters such as flight and foraging activity, population parameters, and exposure level were investigated. Our results show adverse effects of the combination of thiacloprid and prochloraz on the reproductive performance of red mason bees. The number of cocoons produced by O. bicornis was significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the control group. Regarding bumblebees, we found no effects of the thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on any observed parameters of colony development. The maximum detected concentrations of both active substances three days after application were higher in O. bicornis pollen mass compared to B. terrestris stored pollen. We conclude that this worst-case scenario of thiacloprid-prochloraz exposure poses a high risk to solitary bees and thus the use of such mixture should be restricted. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1007/s10646-020-02223-2,29,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11,,0,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
"Comparison of long-term changes in size and longevity of bee colonies in mid-west Japan and Maui with and without exposure to pesticide, cold winters, and mites",710,JOUR,"['Yamada, T.', 'Yamada, K.']",PeerJ,"Four long-term field experiments in mid-west Japan (Shika) made it clear that extinction of colonies exposed to neonicotinoid was much higher than for colonies exposed to organophosphates. The incidence of hive death for of organophosphate-exposed and control (pesticide-free) colonies was similar. We conducted a field experiment in Maui for 271 days using the same pesticides (dinotefuran: 0.2 ppm, clothianidin: 0.08 ppm, fenitrothion: 1 ppm) as used in Shika with the honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies without mites. Numbers of adult bees, capped brood, mites and other hive parameters were accurately counted on photographs of combs and on the inside of the hives. All six neonicotinoid (dinotefuran & clothianidin)-exposed colonies failed during the experiment. One of three organophosphate (fenitrothion)-exposed colonies and one of the three control colonies also failed. The findings from Maui, where colonies displayed no mites, provides evidence from Shika, with mites, that neonicotinoids are more hazardous to honeybee colonies than organophosphates. The apparent longevity of honeybee colonies on Maui was estimated by numbers of adult bees and capped brood using a mathematical model previously proposed. Seasonal changes in longevity on Maui differ greatly from changes at Shika, the latter showing distinct seasonal variation. Longevity on Maui remains nearly constant throughout the year with wide variations. At Shika, it increases drastically in winter, by six- to ten fold more than the other seasons. Differences seem to depend on the existence of cold winters and the length of flowering seasons. In a perpetually hospitable environment, small changes in conditions can be sensitively reflected in apparent longevity. Examining wide variations in apparent longevity that are seemingly incoherent, we recognized several differences in apparent longevity between neonicotinoidexposed and organophosphate-exposed colonies: The colony that failed in after organophosphate-exposure colony group exhibited the longest apparent longevity and the fewest number of newly capped brood, as also was the case in control colonies. Extended longevity when few brood are newly produced is reasonable to maintain the colony from a physiological point of view. Extension of apparent longevity is not seen in neonicotinoid-exposed colonies when the number of newly capped brood is fewer. This finding suggests that neonicotinoid pesticides may inhibit normal apian physiology. © Copyright 2020 Yamada and Yamada.",2020,10.7717/peerj.9505,8,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

Malathion was the most toxic substance to both species, with 48-h median lethal doses (LD50s) of 0.25 ng/bee to A. mellifera and 0.02 ng/bee to T. angustula. Fipronil was also highly toxic and presented a similar toxicity to both species, with 48-h LD50s of 0.5 ng/bee (A. mellifera) and 0.4 ng/bee (T. angustula). Imidacloprid had the lowest acute toxicity with a 48-h LD50 of 29 ng/bee for A. mellifera, whereas T. angustula tolerated exposure higher than 35 ng/bee. Apparent biomarker responses were observed in bees of both species that survived exposure to higher concentrations of malathion (ChE inhibition) and fipronil (increased LPO). Our results suggest that specific sensitivity to insecticides varies greatly among compounds and pollinator species, but the use of different representative species can facilitate the prioritization of substances regarding their risk to pollinators. Further research is necessary to better characterize the risk that pesticides represent in neotropical agricultural landscapes.

Compound and dose-dependent effects of two neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bee (Apis mellifera) metabolic physiology,781,JOUR,"['Cook, S.C.']",Insects,"Use of neonicotinoid pesticides is now ubiquitous, and consequently non-targeted arthropods are exposed to their residues at sub-lethal doses. Exposure to these neurotoxins may be a major contributor to poor honey bee colony health. Few studies have explored how sub lethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee metabolic physiology, including nutritional and energetic homeostasis, both of which are important for maintaining colony health. Reported here are results from a study of chronic oral exposure of honey bees to two sub lethal concentrations of clothianidin and imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids altered important aspects of honey bee nutritional and metabolic physiology in a compound and dose-dependent manner; both compounds at low doses reduced honey bee body weight. Low-dose clothianidin exposure resulted in bees having protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and glycogen levels similar to newly emerged bees. High-dose clothianidin exposure lowered lipids and glycogen content of bees. High-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees having depressed metabolic rate. Low-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees consuming low and high levels of protein and carbohydrate rich foods, respectively. Results suggest neonicotinoids interfere with honey bee endocrine neurophysiological pathways. Compound and dose-dependent effects might represent respective chemical structural differences determining an observed effect, and thresholds of compound effects on honey bee physiology. © 2019 by the author.

Computational insight on the binding and selectivity of target-subunit-dependent for neonicotinoid insecticides,230,JOUR,"['Xu, XY', 'Yang, ZK', 'Zhu, K', 'Li, HL', 'Qin, ZH', 'Duan, HX']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS & MODELLING,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), as an attractive target acted by neonicotinoid insecticides, was paid more and more attention in recent years. The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids. These findings on the diverse mode of action for neonicotinoids to target and non-target receptor would be helpful for on novel insecticides design with high bioactivity as well as good selectivity based on the structure of different insect nAChR.

Concentration- and time-dependent toxicity of commonly encountered pesticides and pesticide mixtures to honeybees (Apis mellifera L.),27,JOUR,"['Bommuraj, V', 'Chen, Y', 'Birenboim, M', 'Barel, S', 'Shimshoni, JA']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Honeybees are exposed to a wide range of pesticides for long periods via contaminated water, pollen and nectar. Some of those pesticides might constitute health hazards in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Time-dependent toxicity profiles for many applied pesticides are lacking, despite the fact that such profiles are crucial for toxicological evaluations. Therefore, we sought to determine the time-dependent toxicities of pesticides/pesticide metabolites frequently found in Israeli beehives, namely, amitraz metabolites, N'-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-methylformamidine (DMPF) and N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-formamide (DMF), coumaphos, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, acetamiprid and dimethoate (toxic reference). By applying accepted methodological approaches such as the modified Haber's rule (product of concentration and exposure duration leads to a constant effect) and comparisons between cumulative doses at different time points, we determined the time-dependent toxicities of these pesticides. We also studied the mixture toxicities of frequently occurring pesticide combinations and estimated their potential contributions to the overall toxicities of neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid was the only pesticide that complied with Haber's rule. DMPF, dimethoate and imidacloprid exhibited time-diminished-toxicities. In contrast, DMF and acetamiprid exhibited time-reinforced toxicities. Neither the binary mixtures nor the tertiary mixtures of DMF, DMPF and coumaphos at 10 times their environmentally relevant concentrations potentiated the neonicotinoids' toxicities. DMPF and imidacloprid were found to present the greatest hazard to honeybees, based on their 50% lethal cumulative dose and 50% lethal time. Amitraz's instability, its low detection frequency and high toxicity profile of its metabolite, DMPF, lead us to the conclusion that DMPF constitutes the actual toxic entity responsible for amitraz's toxic effect.

Consequences of a short time exposure to a sublethal dose of Flupyradifurone (Sivanto) pesticide early in life on survival and immunity in the honeybee (Apis mellifera),231,JOUR,"['Al Naggar, Y', 'Baer, B']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Dramatic losses of pollinating insects have become of global concern, as they threaten not only key ecosystem services but also human food production. Recent research provided evidence that interactions between ecological stressors are drivers of declining pollinator health and responsible for observed population collapses. We used the honeybee Apis mellifera and conducted a series of experiments to test for long-term effects of a single short exposure to the agricultural pesticide flupyradifurone to a second environmental stressor later in life. To do this, we exposed individuals during their larval development or early adulthood to sublethal dosages of flupyradifurone (0.025 mu g for larvae and 0.645 mu g for imagos), either pure or as part of an agricultural formulation (Sivanto). We afterwards exposed bees to a second ecological stressor infecting individuals with 10,000 spores of the fungal gut parasite Nosema ceranae. We found that pesticide exposures significantly reduced survival of bees and altered the expression of several immune and detoxification genes. The ability of bees to respond to these latter effects differed significantly between colonies, offering opportunities to breed bees with elevated levels of pesticide tolerance in the future. We conclude that short episodes of sublethal pesticide exposures during development are sufficient to trigger effects later in life and could therefore contribute to the widespread declines in bee health.",2019,10.1038/s41598-019-56224-1,9,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Conserved grasslands support similar pollinator diversity as pollinator-specific practice regardless of proximal cropland and pesticide exposure,352,JOUR,"['Kraus, JM', 'Smalling, KL', 'Vandever, MW', 'Givens, CE', 'Smith, CD', 'Kolpin, DW', 'Hladik, ML']",ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE,"Pollinator diversity and abundance are declining globally. Cropland agriculture and the corresponding use of agricultural pesticides may contribute to these declines, while increased pollinator habitat (flowering plants) can help mitigate them. Here we tested whether the relative effect of wildflower plantings on pollinator diversity and counts were modified by proportion of nearby agricultural land cover and pesticide exposure in 24 conserved grasslands in Iowa, USA. Compared with general grassland conservation practices, wildflower plantings led to only a 5% increase in pollinator diversity and no change in counts regardless of the proportion of cropland agriculture within a 1 km radius. Pollinator diversity increased earlier in the growing season and with per cent flower cover. Unexpectedly, neither insecticide nor total pesticide concentrations on above-ground passive samplers were related to pollinator diversity. However, pollinator community composition was most strongly related to date of sampling, total pesticide concentration, and forb or flower cover. Our results indicate very little difference in pollinator diversity between grassland conservation practices with and without wildflower plantings. Given the relatively high economic costs of wildflower plantings, our research provides initial evidence that investment in general grassland conservation may efficiently conserve pollinator diversity in temperate regions of intensive cropland agriculture.",2023,10.1098/rsos.231093,10,0.0,1,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,

At the highest doses, we observed larvae and pupae with shorter and longer development times, respectively, and the formation of smaller and asymmetric specimens. Evidently, we need to consider that thiamethoxam reaches the pollen and nectar at residual levels, and that they are processed by nurse bees before destined for offspring.

Contact toxicity of three insecticides for use in tier I pesticide risk assessments with Megachile rotundata (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),658,JOUR,"['Ansell, G.R.', 'Frewin, A.J.', 'Gradish, A.E.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.']",PeerJ,"The current pesticide risk assessment paradigm may not adequately protect solitary bees as it focuses primarily on the honey bee (Apis mellifera). The alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) is a potential surrogate species for use in pesticide risk assessment for solitary bees in North America. However, the toxicity of potential toxic reference standards to M. rotundata will need to be determined before pesticide risk assessment tests (tier I trials) can be implemented. Therefore, we assessed the acute topical toxicity and generated LD50 values for three insecticides: Dimethoate (62.08 ng a.i./bee), permethrin (50.01 ng a.i./bee), and imidacloprid (12.82 ng a.i/bee). The variation in the mass of individual bees had a significant but small effect on these toxicity estimates. Overall, the toxicity of these insecticides to M. rotundata were within the 10- fold safety factor currently used with A. mellifera toxicity estimates from tier I trials to estimate risk to other bee species. Therefore, tier I pesticide risk assessments with solitary bees may not be necessary, and efforts could be directed to developing more realistic, higher-tier pesticide risk assessment trials for solitary bees.  © 2021 Ansell et al.",2021,10.7717/peerj.10744,9,,0,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Contrasting effects of Imidacloprid on habituation in 7- and 8-day-old honeybees (Apis mellifera),1022,JOUR,"['Guez, D.', 'Suchail, S.', 'Gauthier, M.', 'Maleszka, R.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"We examined the effects of sublethal doses (0.1, 1, and 10 ng per animal) of a new neonicotinoid insecticide, Imidacloprid, on habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) reared under laboratory conditions. In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8-10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4-7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4 h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of nicotinic receptors in the honeybee that have different affinities to Imidacloprid and are differentially expressed in 7- and 8-day-old individuals. © 2001 Academic Press.",2001,10.1006/nlme.2000.3995,76,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,
Correlation Between Increased Homing Flight Duration and Altered Gene Expression in the Brain of Honey Bee Foragers After Acute Oral Exposure to Thiacloprid and Thiamethoxam,670,JOUR,"['Christen, V.', 'Grossar, D.', 'Charrière, J.-D.', 'Eyer, M.', 'Jeker, L.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Neonicotinoids as thiamethoxam and thiacloprid are suspected to be implicated in the decline of honey bee populations. As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling in insects, leading to neurotoxicity and are therefore globally used as insecticides. Several behavioral studies have shown links between neonicotinoid exposure of bees and adverse effects on foraging activity, homing flight performance and reproduction, but the molecular aspects underlying these effects are not well-understood. In the last years, several studies through us and others showed the effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on gene expression in the brain of honey bees. Transcripts of acetylcholine receptors, hormonal regulation, stress markers, detoxification enzymes, immune system related genes and transcripts of the energy metabolism were altered after neonicotinoid exposure. To elucidate the link between homing flight performance and shifts in gene expression in the brain of honey bees after neonicotinoid exposure, we combined homing flight activity experiments applying RFID technology and gene expression analysis. We analyzed the expression of endocrine factors, stress genes, detoxification enzymes and genes linked to energy metabolism in forager bees after homing flight experiments. Three different experiments (experiment I: pilot study; experiment II: “worst-case” study and experiment III: laboratory study) were performed. In a pilot study, we wanted to investigate if we could see differences in gene expression between controls and exposed bees (experiment I). This first study was followed by a so-called “worst-case” study (experiment II), where we investigated mainly differences in the expression of transcripts linked to energy metabolism between fast and slow returning foragers. We found a correlation between homing flight duration and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, one transcript linked to oxidative phosphorylation. In the third experiment (experiment III), foragers were exposed in the laboratory to 1 ng/bee thiamethoxam and 8 ng/bee thiacloprid followed by gene expression analysis without a subsequent flight experiment. We could partially confirm the induction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, which we detected in experiment II. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the feeding mode (group feeding vs. single bee feeding) on data scattering and demonstrated that single bee feeding is superior to group feeding as it significantly reduces variability in gene expression. Based on the data, we thus hypothesize that the disruption of energy metabolism may be one reason for a prolongation of homing flight duration in neonicotinoid treated bees.

In Hungary, negative effects on honey bees (associated with clothianidin) persisted over winter and resulted in smaller colonies in the following spring (24% declines). In wild bees (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis), reproduction was negatively correlated with neonicotinoid residues.

Cytotoxic effects of thiamethoxam in the midgut and malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae),967,JOUR,"['Catae, A.F.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'De Oliveira, R.A.', 'Ferreira Nocelli, R.C.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Microscopy Research and Technique,"Due to its expansion, agriculture has become increasingly dependent on the use of pesticides. However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014,10.1002/jemt.22339,77,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,
Decreased efficiency of pollen collection due to Sulfoxaflor exposure leads to a reduction in the size of bumble bee workers in late European summer,550,JOUR,"['Boff, S.', 'Keller, A.', 'Raizer, J.', 'Lupi, D.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) are important pollinators of wild and crop plants. Despite their importance in the process of fruit and seed production on crop sites, their activity may be impaired due to exposure to pesticides. This species has a yearly life cycle and colony success may rely on effective foraging of workers on ruderal plants late in summer when most crops are no longer flowering. In the current study, we investigated the effect of chronic exposure to Sulfoxaflor on aspects of the foraging behavior of bumble bees and whether Sulfoxaflor influences the body size of workers of B. terrestris in a crop landscape. We found that 2 weeks of continuous exposure to Sulfoxaflor influenced workers’ foraging dynamics and collection of resources. However, there was no evidence that the 5 ppb dose of the pesticide impacted the ability of bees to handle flowers with different traits. Workers from colonies exposed to Sulfoxaflor were smaller. The effect on worker size may be explained as a consequence of the reduced pollen income per unit of worker foraging. Thus, if the effects of Sulfoxaflor applied directly to crops had the same effect as that observed on commercial bumble bees after our chronic exposure, it might negatively impact colony success due to the impact on pollen collection and the reduction in the size of workers.

Delayed effects of a single dose of a neurotoxic pesticide (sulfoxaflor) on honeybee foraging activity,584,JOUR,"['Barascou, L.', 'Requier, F.', 'Sené, D.', 'Crauser, D.', 'Le Conte, Y.', 'Alaux, C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Pesticide risk-assessment guidelines for honeybees (Apis mellifera) generally require determining the acute toxicity of a chemical over the short-term through fix-duration tests. However, potential long-lasting or delayed effects resulting from an acute exposure (e.g. a single dose) are often overlooked, although the modification of a developmental process may have life-long consequences. To investigate this question, we exposed young honeybee workers to a single sublethal field-realistic dose of a neurotoxic pesticide, sulfoxaflor, at one of two amounts (16 or 60 ng), at the moment when they initiated orientation flights (preceding foraging activity). We then tracked in the field their flight activity and lifespan with automated life-long monitoring devices. Both amounts of sulfoxaflor administered reduced the total number of flights but did not affect bee survival and flight duration. When looking at the time series of flight activity, effects were not immediate but delayed until foraging activity with a decrease in the daily number of foraging flights and consequently in their total number (24 and 33% less for the 16 and 60 ng doses, respectively). The results of our study therefore blur the general assumption in honeybee toxicology that acute exposure results in immediate and rapid effects and call for long-term recording and/or time-to-effect measurements, even upon exposure to a single dose of pesticide. © 2021",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150351,805,,0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Design and structure optimization of novel butenolide derivatives as low bee-toxicity candidates,2,JOUR,"['Zhu, K.', 'Lu, X.', 'Li, X.', 'Han, Q.', 'Zou, R.', 'Yang, Z.', 'Li, H.', 'Duan, H.']",Journal of Molecular Structure,"The discovery of new neonicotinoid alternatives with high efficiency against pests and eco-safety toward bees has become an increasingly urgent need in recent years. The relationship between the oil-water partition coefficient (logP) and the bee-toxicity of commercial nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) competitive modulators was explored in this work. Compared compounds with a high bee-toxicity, compounds with low bee-toxicity were found to have higher logP values. Therefore, two series of novel butenolide derivatives with different hydrophobic groups were designed and synthesized by including different hydrophobic groups. The insecticidal activity study showed that compounds I-01 (LC50=112.96 μg/mL), II-05 (LC50=124.68 μg/mL), and II-11 (LC50=87.89 μg/mL) were with higher insecticidal activity against Aphis glycines and lower calculated logP values among all synthesized compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that three butenolide compounds formed some hydrogen bonding or π-π stacking interactions with insect acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). In addition, the bee-toxicity bioassay also showed that compounds I-01, II-05 and II-11 were with much lower contact bee-toxicity than imidacloprid. The possible mechanism of the bee toxicity of the novel butenolide compounds was explored based on the nAChR function subunit AmeIα8/ratβ2.

Design of environmentally friendly neonicotinoid insecticides with bioconcentration tuning and Bi-directional selective toxic effects,381,JOUR,"['Zhao, YY', 'Li, Y']",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"A 3D-QSAR model was established with CoMSIA to characterize neonicotinoid insecticides. LgBCF values were used as the dependent variable and the molecular structures of 30 compounds were used as the independent variable. This model was used to design neonicotinoid insecticides with reduced bioconcentration. The contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model were used to evaluate substituted sites and different substituents that significantly affected the bioconcentration of neonicotinoid insecticides. The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

Growing research suggested that neonicotinoid insecticides are a key factor causing the decline of global pollinator insects, such as bees. Flupyrimin (FLP) is a novel nicotinic insecticide with unique biological properties and no cross-resistance, and is safe for pollinators. Using FLP as the lead compound, a series of novel compounds were designed and synthesized by replacing the amide fragment with a sulfonamideone. Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS spectra. Bioassay results showed that compound 2j had good insecticidal activity against Aphis glycines with an LC50 value of 20.93 mg/L. Meanwhile, compound 2j showed significantly lower acute oral and contact toxicity to Apis mellifera. In addition, compound 2j interacted well with the protein in insect acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). The molecular docking on honeybee nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) indicated that the sulfonamide group of compound 2j did not form a hydrogen bond with Arg173 of the β subunit, which conforms to the reported low bee-toxicity conformation. In general, target compound 2j can be regarded as a bee-friendly insecticide candidate. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,10.3390/molecules27186133,27,,0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

We previously reported that a cis-configuration neonicotinoid (IPPA08) exhibited specific synergistic activity toward neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, we synthesized a series of structural analogues of IPPA08 by converting the pyridyl moiety of IPPA08 into phenyl groups, via facile double-Mannich condensation reactions between nitromethylene compounds and glutaraldehyde. All of the oxabridged neonicotinoid compounds were found to increase the toxicity of imidacloprid against Aphis craccivora. Notably, compound 25 at 0.75 mg/L lowered the LC50 value of imidacloprid against A. craccivora by 6.54-fold, while a 3.50-fold reduction of the LC50 value was observed for IPPA08. The results of bee toxicity test showed that compound 25 display selectivity in its effects on imidacloprid toxicity against the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).

In Brazil, stingless bees are responsible for 40% to 90% of tree species pollination, depending on the considered ecosystem. However, their survival has been threatened since the country has been standing out as a big consumer of pesticides. Many of the pesticides used are considered toxic to bees, including imidacloprid. Although the bees are not the target of these substances, they are highly vulnerable to contamination. Thereby, the objective of this study was to establish the mean lethal dose (LD50) and the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid for the M. Scutellaris. In order to carry out this experiment, bees were collected and the test was performed according to OECD's protocol (1998a, 1998b), developed for A. mellifera. For the determination of LD50 and LC50, data was analyzed through the Probit method. The topical LD50 established in this study was 2.41 ng/bee for 24 hours and 1.29 ng/bee for 48 hours. The oral LC50 was 2.01 ng i.a./μL for 24 hours and 0.81 ng i.a./μL for 48 hours.

Detrimental effects of clothianidin on foraging and dance communication in honey bees,690,JOUR,"['Tison, L.', 'Duer, A.', 'Púčiková, V.', 'Greggers, U.', 'Menzel, R.']",PLoS ONE,"Ongoing losses of pollinators are of significant international concern because of the essential role they have in our ecosystem, agriculture, and economy. Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to their decline, but the increasing use of neonicotinoid insecticides has recently emerged as particularly concerning. In this study, honey bees were exposed orally to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the field in order to assess its effects on the foraging behavior, homing success, and dance communication. The foraging span and foraging activity at the contaminated feeder decreased significantly due to chronic exposure at field-realistic concentrations. Electrostatic field of dancing bees was measured and it was revealed that the number of waggle runs, the fanning time and the number of stop signals were significantly lower in the exposed colony. No difference was found in the homing success and the flight duration between control and treated bees released at a novel location within the explored area. However, a negative effect of the ambient temperature, and an influence of the location of the trained feeder was found. Finally, the residues of clothianidin accumulated in the abdomens of exposed foraging bees over time. These results show the adverse effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal doses of clothianidin on foraging and dance communication in honey bees. © 2020 Tison et al.

Detrimental interactions of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and bumblebee immunity,290,JOUR,"['Czerwinski, MA', 'Sadd, B']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,"Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects. However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.",2017,10.1002/jez.2087,327,,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,

Clothianidin neonicotinoid appears to impair the microbe–immunity axis. We conducted cage experiments on newly emerged bees that were 4–6 days old and used a 16S rRNA metataxonomic approach to measure the impact of three sublethal clothianidin concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) on survival, sucrose syrup consumption and gut microbiota community structure. Exposure to clothianidin significantly increased mortality in the three concentrations compared to controls. Interestingly, the lowest clothianidin concentration was associated with the highest mortality, and the medium concentration with the highest food intake. Exposure to clothianidin induced significant variation in the taxonomic distribution of gut microbiota activity. Co-abundance network analysis revealed local dysbiosis signatures specific to each gut section (midgut, ileum and rectum) were driven by specific taxa. Our findings confirm that exposure to clothianidin triggers a reshuffling of beneficial strains and/or potentially pathogenic taxa within the gut, suggesting a honeybee’s symbiotic defense systems’ disruption, such as resistance to microbial colonization. This study highlights the role of weak transcriptional activity taxa in maintaining a stable honeybee gut microbiota. Finally, the early detection of gut dysbiosis in honeybees is a promising biomarker in hive management for assessing the impact exposure to sublethal xenobiotics. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the molecular bases mediated at the gene level remain to be discovered. Here, we found four heat shock protein DnaJB subfamily genes, DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14, from Apis cerana cerana, that all have J domains in their protein sequences. The expression levels of DnaJB6 and DnaJshv were upregulated by different degrees of heat stress, and the transcript level of DnaJB14 was gradually upregulated as the degree of heat stress increased, while the mRNA level of DnaJB13 was downregulated at multiple time points during heat stress treatment. The mRNA levels of all four DnaJBs were upregulated by cold and UV stress. In addition, the expression levels of DnaJB6, DnaJshv and DnaJB13 were reduced under abamectin, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl stresses. The transcript level of DnaJB14 was decreased by imidacloprid, cypermethrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl exposure but increased by abamectin and bifenthrin exposure. These results indicate that the demand of A. cerana cerana for these four DnaJBs differs under various stress conditions. To further explore the role of DnaJBs in the stress response, we successfully silenced DnaJshv and DnaJB14. The content of protein carbonyl was increased, while the content of VC, the enzymatic activities of CAT, GST, and SOD, the mRNA levels of many antioxidant-related genes, and the total antioxidant capacity were reduced after knockdown of DnaJshv and DnaJB14 in A. cerana cerana. These results indicate that silencing DnaJshv and DnaJB14 increases oxidative damage and decreases the antioxidant ability of A. cerana cerana. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14 are differentially expressed under stress conditions and play crucial roles in response to various stressors, possibly through the antioxidant signalling pathway. These findings will be conducive to understanding the molecular basis of bee responses to environmental stresses and are beneficial for improving bee protection.",2022,10.3389/fevo.2022.873791,10,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Changes in the immune response may hinder insects more susceptible to diseases and increase the risk of pathogen infection and pest resistance. We found that imidacloprid and amitraz alter the oxidative response of insect hemocytes at different concentrations of the immune stimulator, zymosan A. There is a differential effect of imidacloprid and amitraz on hemocytes of insects from different orders and their effect on oxidative response in insects persists beyond the point of early contact with zymosan A. Invertebrates have a diverse immune system that responds differently to stressors such as pesticides and pathogens, which leads to different degrees of susceptibility. Honeybees are facing a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder which is attributed to several factors including pesticides and pathogens. We applied an in vitro approach to assess the response of immune-activated hemocytes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Mamestra brassicae after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz. Hemocytes were exposed to the pesticides in single and co-exposures using zymosan A for immune activation. We measured the effect of these exposures on cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production from 15 to 120 min and on extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production after 3 h to assess potential alterations in the oxidative response. Our results indicate that NO and H2O2 production is more altered in honeybee hemocytes compared to D. melanogaster and M. brassicae cell lines. There is also a differential production at different time points after pesticide exposure between these insect species as contrasting effects were evident with the oxidative responses in hemocytes. The results imply that imidacloprid and amitraz act differently on the immune response among insect orders and may render honeybee colonies more susceptible to infection and pests.",2023,10.3390/insects14020174,14,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,

Changing patterns of immune-related gene expressions and the activities of four enzymes between the two bee species were compared and analyzed after exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides. Results indicated that A. cerana was more sensitive to imidacloprid and clothianidin than A. mellifera. The acute oral LD50 values of imidacloprid and clothianidin for A. mellifera were 8.6 and 2.0 ng/bee, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for A. cerana were 2.7 and 0.5 ng/bee. The two bee species possessed distinct abilities to mount innate immune response against neonicotinoids. After 48 h of imidacloprid treatment, carboxylesterase (CCE), prophenol oxidase (PPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were significantly downregulated in A. mellifera but were upregulated in A. cerana. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly elevated in A. mellifera at 48 h after exposure to imidacloprid, but no significant change was observed in A. cerana. AChE was downregulated in both bee species at three different time points during clothianidin exposure, and GST activities were upregulated in both species exposed to clothianidin.

Recently, global populations of honey bees have rapidly declined owing to colony collapse disorder (CCD), the mechanism of which is still unknown. Here, we used mRNA levels of heat shock protein (HSP) genes as molecular markers of response to three types of external stress: thermal shock, flower-thinning agents, and pesticides. When worker bees were exposed to temperatures of 4, 27, 40, 45 and 50. °C for 1. h, decreased survival occurred only at 50. °C. Further, increased levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90, but not hsp40, were detected, and reached a maximum at 45. °C, particularly in the hypopharyngeal glands and fat bodies. Artificial ingestion of two flower-thinning agents containing either 0.1% boron and zinc, or 1% sulfur increased hsp70 and grp78 levels at different rates without affecting hsp40 and hsp90 levels, and had no effect on workers' mortality. However, ingestion of imidacloprid solution (0.5-50. ppm) increased mortality in workers and decreased the levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results showed that the responses of honey bees to each hsp are differential and highly specific to different stresses.

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125μgl-1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10μgl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",2012,10.1016/j.zool.2012.05.003,115,,0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

In this study, the nAChR α1 subunit from Apis mellifera was first found to be narrowly tuned to different bee toxicity insecticides, namely, sulfoxaflor (SFX) and flupyradifurone (FPF). Hence, novel sulfoximine derivatives 7a-h were rationally designed and synthesized by introducing a benzo[d][1,3]dioxole moiety into a unique sulfoximine skeleton based on the binding cavity characteristics of Amelα1/ratβ2. The two electrode voltage clamp responses of 7a-h were obviously lower than that of SFX, indicating their potentially low bee toxicity. Besides, representative compounds 7b and 7g exhibited low bee toxicity (LD50 > 11.0 μg/bee at 48 h) revealed by acute contact toxicity bioassays. Molecular modelling results indicated that Ile152, Ala151, and Val160 from honeybee subunit Amelα1 and Lys144 and Trp80 from aphid subunit Mpα1 may be crucial for bee toxicity and aphicidal activity, respectively. These results clarify the toxic mechanism of agonist insecticides on nontargeted pollinators and reveal novel scaffold sulfoximine aphicidal candidates with low bee toxicity.

Discrepancy between acute and chronic toxicity induced by imidacloprid and its metabolites in Apis mellifera,1014,JOUR,"['Suchail, S.', 'Guez, D.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Imidactoprid is a systemic nitroguanidine insecticide that belongs to the neonicotinoid family. As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative) were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10-10,000 μg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 μg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 μg/kg) at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of imidacloprid. Olefin LD50 values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The 5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a LD50 four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40% mortality at 1,000 ng/bee (10,000 μg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity, worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L of imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was consumed at the mean rate of 12 μl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/kg). Thus, all tested compounds were toxic at doses 30 to 3,000 (olefin), 60 to 6,000 (imidacloprid), 200 to 20,000 (5-OH-imidacloprid), and > 1,000 to 100,000 (remaining metabolites) times lower than those required to produce the same effect in acute intoxication studies.

Diverse pollen nutrition can improve the development of solitary bees but does not mitigate negative pesticide impacts,417,JOUR,"['Schwarz, J.M.', 'Knauer, A.C.', 'Alaux, C.', 'Barascou, L.', 'Barraud, A.', 'Dievart, V.', 'Ghazoul, J.', 'Michez, D.', 'Albrecht, M.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Floral resource loss and pesticide exposure are major threats to bees in intensively managed agroecosystems, but interactions among these drivers remain poorly understood. Altered composition and lowered diversity of pollen nutrition may reinforce negative pesticide impacts on bees. Here we investigated the development and survival of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis provisioned with three different pollen types, as well as a mixture of these types representing a higher pollen diversity. We exposed bees of each nutritional treatment to five pesticides at different concentrations in the laboratory. Two field-realistic concentrations of three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) modulating insecticides (thiacloprid, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone), as well as of two fungicides (azoxystrobin and tebuconazole) were examined. We further measured the expression of two detoxification genes (CYP9BU1, CYP9BU2) under exposure to thiacloprid across different nutrition treatments as a potential mechanistic pathway driving pesticide-nutrition interactions. We found that more diverse pollen nutrition reduced development time, enhanced pollen efficacy (cocoon weight divided by consumed pollen weight) and pollen consumption, and increased weight of O. bicornis after larval development (cocoon weight). Contrary to fungicides, high field-realistic concentrations of all three insecticides negatively affected O. bicornis by extending development times. Moreover, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone also reduced pollen efficacy and cocoon weight, and sulfoxaflor reduced pollen consumption and increased mortality. The expression of detoxification genes differed across pollen nutrition types, but was not enhanced after exposure to thiacloprid. Our findings highlight that lowered diversity of pollen nutrition and high field-realistic exposure to nAChR modulating insecticides negatively affected the development of O. bicornis, but we found no mitigation of negative pesticide impacts through increased pollen diversity.

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential impact of maize grown from imidacloprid-treated seeds on honey bee mortality. A survey of 16 apiaries was carried out, and all maize fields treated or not with imidacloprid were located within a radius of 3,000 m around the observed apiaries. Samples of honey, beeswax, and bees were collected in three colonies per apiary and analyzed for pesticide contain by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We first found a significant correlation between the number of colonies per apiary and the mortality rates in an apiary. In addition, this mortality rate was inversely correlated with the surface of maize fields treated and not with imidacloprid, suggesting that this pesticide do not interact with bees' fitness. Moreover, a very large number of our samples contained acaricides either prohibited or ineffective against Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) (Acari: Varroidae), suggesting that the treatment methods used by the beekeepers to be inadequate for mite control.

"Does transgenic Cry1Ac + CpTI cotton pollen affect hypopharyngeal gland development and midgut proteolytic enzyme activity in the honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera, Apidae)",984,JOUR,"['Han, P.', 'Niu, C.-Y.', 'Biondi, A.', 'Desneux, N.']",Ecotoxicology,"The transgenic Cry1Ac (Bt toxin) ? CpTI (Cowpea Trypsin Inhibitor) cotton cultivar CCRI41 is increasingly used in China and potential side effects on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. have been documented recently. Two studies have assessed potential lethal and sublethal effects in young bees fed with CCRI41 cotton pollen but no effect was observed on learning capacities, although lower feeding activity in exposed honey bees was noted (antifeedant effect). The present study aimed at providing further insights into potential side effects of CCRI41 cotton on honey bees. Emerging honey bees were exposed to different pollen diets using no-choice feeding protocols (chronic exposure) in controlled laboratory conditions and we aimed at documenting potential mechanisms underneath the CCRI41 antifeedant effect previously reported. Activity of midgut proteolytic enzyme of young adult honey bees fed on CCRI41 cotton pollen were not significantly affected, i.e. previously observed antifeedant effect was not linked to disturbed activity of the proteolytic enzymes in bees' midgut. Hypopharyngeal gland development was assessed by quantifying total extractable proteins from the glands. Results suggested that CCRI41 cotton pollen carries no risk to hypopharyngeal gland development of young adult honey bees. In the two bioassays, honey bees exposed to 1 % soybean trypsin inhibitor were used as positive controls for both midgut proteolytic enzymes and hypopharyngeal gland proteins quantification, and bees exposed to 48 ppb (part per billion) (i.e. 48 ng g -1) imidacloprid were used as controls for exposure to a sublethal concentration of toxic product. The results show that the previously reported antifeedant effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees is not linked to effects on their midgut proteolytic enzymes or on the development of their hypopharyngeal glands.

Does winter oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-coated seeds affect experimental populations of mason bees and bumblebees?

While bees in the field get rarely exposed to lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids applied as seed coating, sublethal levels found in pollen and nectar may affect bee population development. We assessed a realistic and a worst-case scenario of clothianidin exposure to mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) by conducting a small-scale field and semi-field experiment at sites planted with winter oilseed rape. Flight activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were assessed at three locations. We also analysed clothianidin residues in bee-collected pollen and nectar. We detected clothianidin at low concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7 µg/kg for bumblebees and 4.7 µg/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10 g clothianidin/kg seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population development. However, an impairment of flower visitation under a worst-case scenario may have implications for pollination services and crop production. © 2019, Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).",2019,10.1007/s00003-019-01225-5,14,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Drone honey bees are disproportionately sensitive to abiotic stressors despite expressing high levels of stress response proteins,539,JOUR,"['McAfee, A.', 'Metz, B.N.', 'Milone, J.P.', 'Foster, L.J.', 'Tarpy, D.R.']",Communications Biology,"Drone honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the obligate sexual partners of queens, and the availability of healthy, high-quality drones directly affects a queen’s fertility and productivity. Yet, our understanding of how stressors affect adult drone fertility, survival, and physiology is presently limited. Here, we investigated sex biases in susceptibility to abiotic stressors (cold stress, topical imidacloprid exposure, and topical exposure to a realistic cocktail of pesticides). We found that drones (haploid males) were more sensitive to cold and imidacloprid exposure than workers (sterile, diploid females), but the cocktail was not toxic at the concentrations tested. We corroborated this lack of cocktail toxicity with in-hive exposures via pollen feeding. We then used quantitative proteomics to investigate protein expression profiles in the hemolymph of topically exposed workers and drones, and found that 34 proteins were differentially expressed in exposed drones relative to controls, but none were differentially expressed in exposed workers. Contrary to our hypothesis, we show that drones express surprisingly high baseline levels of putative stress response proteins relative to workers. This suggests that drones’ stress tolerance systems are fundamentally rewired relative to workers, and susceptibility to stress depends on more than simply gene dose or allelic diversity. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,10.1038/s42003-022-03092-7,5,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Significantly less number of bees were observed with mahua oil one day after spray- 2.15 (Apis dorsata), 1.33 (A. cerana), 1.72 (A. florea) and 1.24 (Tetragonula iridipennis). BIPM (biointensive integrated pest management) and spinosad treatments led to maximum number of bees at 4 and 7 days after spray. The least mean time spent was observed with mahua oil treatment, whereas, BIPM and spinosad led to maximum mean time spent for all the bee pollinators.

Ecological toxicity reduction of dinotefuran to honeybee: New perspective from an enantiomeric level,23,JOUR,"['Chen, Z.', 'Yao, X.', 'Dong, F.', 'Duan, H.', 'Shao, X.', 'Chen, X.', 'Yang, T.', 'Wang, G.', 'Zheng, Y.']",Environment International,"In last decade, there has been a concerted effort to reduce the potential threats of honeybees' population due to exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides. A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7–2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to α8 subunit of nAChR of Apis mellifera. The α8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations. © 2019 The Authors",2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.048,130,,0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Ecologically Appropriate Xenobiotics Induce Cytochrome P450s in Apis mellifera,193,JOUR,"['Johnson, RM', 'Mao, WF', 'Pollock, HS', 'Niu, GD', 'Schuler, MA', 'Berenbaum, MR']",PLOS ONE,"Background: Honey bees are exposed to phytochemicals through the nectar, pollen and propolis consumed to sustain the colony. They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey.

Ecotoxicological QSAR Modeling of Organophosphorus and Neonicotinoid Pesticides,478,CHAP,"['Bora, A', 'Crisan, L', 'Borota, A', 'Funar-Timofei, S', 'Ilia, G']",ECOTOXICOLOGICAL QSARS,"Organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides are important agrochemicals used worldwide. The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data. The ligand-based combined with structure-based approaches remain a powerful tool in the design of new environment-friendly and less toxic organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides.",2020,,,,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Among pesticides, neonicotinoid insecticides are the biggest threat. Due to their extensive use, they can be found in all agricultural environments, including soil, water, and air, are persistent in the environment, and are highly toxic for honey bees. In addition, infection by different pests and pathogens can act synergistically, weakening bees. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid alone or combined with the microsporidia Nosema ceranae on the immune response, deformed wing virus infection (DWV), gut microbiota, and survival of Africanized honey bees. We found that imidacloprid affected the expression of some genes associated with immunity generating an altered physiological state, although it did not favor DWV or N. ceranae infection. The pesticide alone did not affect honey bee gut microbiota, as previously suggested, but when administered to N. ceranae infected bees, it generated significant changes. Finally, both stress factors caused high mortality rates. Those results illustrate the negative impact of imidacloprid alone or combined with N. ceranae on Africanized honey bees and are useful to understand colony losses in Latin America. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s00248-022-02014-8,85,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,

Colonies of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) were used for comparison. Eight colonies (four of A. mellifera and four of S. mexicana) were moved into each of two mango orchards, one was used as a control, with no insecticide application, and other received five weekly aerial sprays of GF-120.

The insecticide imidacloprid has shown a drastic effect on the olfactory behavior of A. m. jemenitica in the harsh arid climatic conditions of central Saudi Arabia. The oral feeding of single imidacloprid sub-lethal doses (1.0 ng, 0.5 ng, or 0.1 ng) under laboratory conditions significantly impaired associative learning during the 2nd and 3rd conditioning trials compared to control bees (0 ng). The memory tests also revealed significant impairment in memory formation at 1 h, 2 h, and 24 h after conditioning compared to control bees. Even the lowest dose (0.1 ng/bee) can significantly impair the bees’ ability to learn and memorize. This impairment effect was dose dependent and increased with increasing doses.

Effect of acute pesticide exposure on bee spatial working memory using an analogue of the radial-arm maze,81,JOUR,"['Samuelson, EEW', 'Chen-Wishart, ZP', 'Gill, RJ', 'Leadbeater, E']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Pesticides, including neonicotinoids, typically target pest insects by being neurotoxic. Inadvertent exposure to foraging insect pollinators is usually sub-lethal, but may affect cognition. One cognitive trait, spatial working memory, may be important in avoiding previously-visited flowers and other spatial tasks such as navigation. To test this, we investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial working memory in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, using an adaptation of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules. We then exposed bees to either a high sub-lethal positive control thiamethoxam dose (2.5 ng(-1) bee), or one of two low doses (0.377 or 0.091 ng(-1)) based on estimated field-realistic exposure. The high dose caused bees to make more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the task than unexposed bees. For the low doses, the negative effects were smaller but statistically significant, and dependent on bee size.

Frequent exposure to toxic pesticides is one of the major risk factors causing the pollinator population decline. However, age effects of honey bees on pesticide susceptibility have been largely ignored and many researchers use bees of unknown age for assessing the risk of pesticides. Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. © 2020",2020,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108844,238,,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

However, limited information is available on the pesticide effects on solitary bees, especially in Neotropical countries. In this scenario, this study evaluated the survival and histopathological effects caused by the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/μL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/μL) in the midgut and parietal fat body of the solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male newly-emerged bees were orally exposed for 48 h to the pesticides, or alone or in combination, under laboratory conditions. The exposure to the insecticide reduced the survival of males, while the mixture reduced survival in both sexes. Acetamiprid promoted a reduction in the number of regenerative nests in the midgut, alterations of fat body cells by increasing carbohydrates in trophocytes, and reduction of oenocyte size, and increased the frequency of pericardial cells in the advanced activity stage. Both pesticides caused changes in HSP70 immunolabelling of midgut from males at the end of pesticide exposure.

Effect of repeated intakes of a neonicotinoid insecticide on the foraging behaviours of Apis mellifera in field trials,103,JOUR,"['Girolami, V', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Mazzon, L', 'Zampieri, F', 'Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Evaluating the effects of neonicotinoids on forager bees in conditions as near as possible to those in nature presents a considerable challenge. Tackling this challenge is, however, necessary to establish their negative side effects on these pollinators. For instance, it is still under debate the mechanism by which bees seem to recognize low-level contaminations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar and pollen of the flowers they visit and limit collection to protect themselves and their hive from a possible intoxication. In this study, we propose an experimental system that involves the use of foragers in free flight foraging repeatedly on artificial feeders containing a sucrose solution contaminated with clothianidin, as well as foragers feeding at adjacent control feeders, allowing us to observe changes in their foraging activity. The progressive disappearance of foragers from the contaminated feeders became increasingly clear and rapid with the increase in clothianidin concentration. The lowest concentration at which we observed an effect was around 10 mu g/L, which corresponds to the maximum residual concentration (10 ng/g) observed in pollen and nectar of flowers close to open fields sown with seeds coated with insecticides. At the highest concentrations tested (80 mu g/L), there was an almost total abandonment of the feeders. The estimated quantity of contaminated sucrose solution collected by foragers showed an almost linear relationship inversely proportional to clothianidin concentration, whilst the estimated quantity of insecticide collected by a forager increased and then stabilised at the highest concentrations tested of 40 and 80 mu g/L. Irregular mortality was not observed in front of the hives, furthermore, foragers did not show evident memory of the position of the treated units in the trials on the 2 consecutive days. The decrease in foraging activity in the presence of a few mu g/L of insecticide in the sucrose solution appears to limit the introduction of elevated amounts of toxic substances into the hives, which would have serious consequences for the young bees and the brood. At the same time, in the absence of an alternative energy source, even reduced feeding of the hive can compromise colony health.",2023,10.1007/s11356-022-22977-y,30,,0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Different samples of bees were fed with different concentrations of insecticides in sugar-water solution and the inhibitory effects were studied in terms of percentage inhibition in the head tissue of the honey bees. It was revealed that all the organophosphates inhibited AChE at the normal recommended concentration. Chlorpyriphos, methyl-parathion and triazophos proved to be the most potent inhibitors causing an inhibition in the range of 91 to 98% under different feeding methods. Thiodicarb inhibited the enzyme to a level where apparent signs of poisoning could be visible, whereas carbosulfan did not prove to be anticholinesterase in action.

Brood index, compensation index, and brood termination rate were calculated for the brood area (2 sq. inch) selected at two time intervals i.e. at the time of spray (D0) and seven days after that (D7). Brood index for the brood selected at D7 of thiamethoxam applied at 25 g a.i. ha−1 was statistically at par with the untreated control i.e. its value at 21 days (1.00 ± 0.00-4.48 ± 0.04) was statistically at par with the untreated control (1.00 ± 0.00-4.66 ± 0.01).

To assess the frequency of floral patch use by bees in each hive, we attached electronic tags to bees foraging on white mustard flowers and then recorded the number of tagged bees in each hive a day before insecticide spraying in the adjacent paddy fields. The number of corpses around hive entrances increased within a day after the spraying but varied among hives. There was a significant negative correlation between the number of tagged bees and the cumulative number of corpses at each hive.

The results showed that the foraging behavior of honey bee colonies located near rice cultivation areas did not exhibit significant differences between the treatment sites (Cheongyang and Gimje) and the control site (Wanju) during the experimental period. However, it was observed that the expression levels of stress-related genes in honey bees collected from the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulators of gene expression. In this study, we initially determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of dinotefuran was 0.773 mg/l. Then, the expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in honey bee brains after 1, 5, and 10 d of treatment with the lethal concentration 10 (LC10) of dinotefuran were explored via deep small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 2, 23, and 27 DE miRNAs were identified after persistent exposure to the LC10 of dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d, respectively.

Effects of Flupyradifurone and Two Reference Insecticides Commonly Used in Toxicological Studies on the Larval Proteome of the Honey bee Apis mellifera,60,JOUR,"['Kablau, A', 'Erler, S', 'Eckert, JH', 'Pistorius, J', 'Sharbati, S', 'Einspanier, R']",INSECTS,"Simple Summary Insecticides are considered to be one of the major factors of bee decline. In this study, the potential sublethal effects of selected neonicotinoids on honey bee larvae were investigated by protein expression profiling for the first time. The total larval protein expression was investigated by 2D gel electrophoresis after exposure to the insecticides dimethoate, fenoxycarb and flupyradifurone. Protein spots whose concentrations differed significantly from the controls were sequenced and identified against known insect proteins. Although the treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development, the proteome comparisons showed differences in the metabolism, immune response and energy supply of the bee larvae. The strongest influence was found for flupyradifurone, which activates various detoxification pathways, the immune response or tissue regeneration. Our results suggest that there may be a delayed larval development or possibly a reduced honey bee brood vitality at sublethal concentrations. The western honey bee Apis mellifera is globally distributed due to its beekeeping advantages and plays an important role in the global ecology and economy. In recent decades, several studies have raised concerns about bee decline. Discussed are multiple reasons such as increased pathogen pressure, malnutrition or pesticide use. Insecticides are considered to be one of the major factors. In 2013, the use of three neonicotinoids in the field was prohibited in the EU. Flupyradifurone was introduced as a potential successor; it has a comparable mode of action as the banned neonicotinoids. However, there is a limited number of studies on the effects of sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone on honey bees. Particularly, the larval physiological response by means of protein expression has not yet been studied. Hence, the larval protein expression was investigated via 2D gel electrophoresis after following a standardised protocol to apply sublethal concentrations of the active substance (flupyradifurone 10 mg/kg diet) to larval food.

It is imperative to identify factors responsible for accelerated declines in bee populations and develop solutions for reversing bee losses. While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees.

In response to mounting evidence supporting the detrimental effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, a novel 'bee safe' butenolide compound, flupyradifurone (FPF) has been registered for use in agricultural use. Although FPF is not a neonicotinoid, like neonicotinoids, it is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. In addition, A. mellifera faces threats from pathogens, such as the microsporidian endoparasite, Nosema ceranae (Fries et al. 1996). We therefore sought 1) to increase our understanding of the potential effects of FPF on honey bees by focusing on a crucial behavior, the ability to learn and remember an odor associated with a food reward, and 2) to test for a potential synergistic effect on such learning by exposure to FPF and infection with N. ceranae. We found little evidence that FPF significantly alters learning and memory at short-term field-realistic doses. However, at high doses and at chronic, field-realistic exposure, FPF did reduce learning and memory in an olfactory conditioning task. Infection with N. ceranae also reduced learning, but there was no synergy (no significant interaction) between N. ceranae and exposure to FPF. These results suggest the importance of continued studies on the chronic effects of FPF.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The main objective of the present study was to evaluate comparatively the health of Carniolan and Africanized honey bees (AHB) co-exposed to thiamethoxam and Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae) spores. Newly-emerged worker honey bees were exposed solely with different sublethal doses of thiamethoxam (2% and 0.2% of LD50 for AHB), which could be consumed by bees under field conditions. Toxicity tests for the Carniolan bees were performed, and the LD50 of thiamethoxam for Carniolan honey bees was 7.86 ng bee-1. Immunohistological analyses were also performed to detect cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and/or N. ceranae treated bees. Thiamethoxam exposure had no negative impact on Nosema development in experimental conditions, but it clearly inhibited cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and Nosema-exposed bees, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical data. Indeed, thiamethoxam exposure only had a minor synergistic toxic effect on midgut tissue when applied as a low dose simultaneously with N. ceranae to AHB and Carniolan honey bees, in comparison with the effect caused by both stressors separately.

We examined a methodology for testing Osmia lignaria Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) larval responses to pesticide exposure using a laboratory bioassay. We created two provision types: a homogenized blend of O. lignaria provisions from an apple orchard and homogenized almond pollen pellets collected by honey bees plus sugar water. Pesticides were administered to the provisions to compare toxic effects. We recorded larval developmental durations for second-fifth instar and for fifth instar to cocoon initiation for larvae fed provisions treated with water (control) or doses of three pesticides and a representative spray-tank mixture (acetamiprid, boscalid/pyraclostrobin, dimethoate, and acetamiprid plus boscalid/pyraclostrobin).

Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Young Adult Honeybee Behaviour,190,JOUR,"['Goñalons, C', 'Farina, WM']",PLOS ONE,"Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10,,0,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on the Expression of Neurometabolic Genes in Apis cerana cerana,576,JOUR,"['Qiu, Y.', 'Wu, F.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Li, H.']",Scientia Agricultura Sinica,"【Background】The target of neonicotinoid insecticides is the acetylcholine receptor in the nervous system of insects. Due to its good systemicity and low toxicity to humans and animals, it has been widely used in agricultural production. Thus there is still a low residue in plants, and this sublethal dose residue can still cause adverse effects on the behavior and nervous system of flower-visiting insects like bees.【Objective】The objective of this study is to clarify the effect of sublethal dose imidacloprid (a kind of neonicotinoid insecticides) on the nervous physiological and metabolism system of Apis cerana cerana【. Method】In this study, the worker bees were treated with two sublethal concentration gradient doses of 5 and 10 μg•L-1 imidacloprid for 10 days (three biological replicates). After total RNA was extracted, the resulting library was analyzed by RNA-seq. Throughput sequencing, and the bioinformatics technology was used to assemble and annotate the sequence de novo, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after sublethal doses imidacloprid treatment were analyzed by clustering and enrichment. Finally, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology was used to verify the DEGs related to the nervous and metabolic systems.【Result】A total of 9 sequencing libraries were obtained, the ratio of effective sequencing data exceeded 94.45%. From the obtained 37 364 unigenes, 571 DEGs were identified. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG found that the DEGs were mainly related to multiple pathways such as protein translation, redox, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome, indicating that sublethal doses of imidacloprid had an impact on multiple physiological processes and metabolic pathways of A. c. cerana.

Before sowing, the seeds were treated with an equivalent application of 18 g thiamethoxam/ha. For comparison, a second apiary (5 colonies) was located in front of a separate 750 m plot sown with untreated wOSR. Dead foragers at the entrance of hives were assessed every 2–3 days throughout the exposure period, while the colony strength (number of combs covered with adult honey bees and brood) and pathogens were monitored each month until the following spring. Foraging on the wOSR crop was confirmed by melissopalynology determination of the corbicular pollen collected periodically, while the chemical analysis showed that exposure to thiamethoxam was mainly through nectar. There was an increase in the accumulation of dead bees in the apiary exposed to thiamethoxam relating with the control, which was coped with an increment of bee brood surface and adult bee population. However, we did not find statistically significant differences between apiaries (α = 0.05) in terms of the evolution of pathogens.

Effects of a chronic dietary exposure of the honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) to imidacloprid,263,JOUR,"['Schmuck, R']",ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY,"Previous studies have shown that imidacloprid and insecticidally active imidacloprid plant metabolites are rapidly metabolized by honeybees. Accordingly, no striking differences were expected between the acute and the chronic dietary toxicity of imidacloprid to honeybees. More recently, however, an unexpectedly high chronic dietary toxicity to honeybees was reported for imidacloprid and imidacloprid plant metabolites, and a novel pharmacologic mechanism unrelated to the parent toxophor was postulated. In an extensive literature survey, no further evidence was found for the reported high difference between the acute and the chronic dietary toxicity of imidacloprid and its plant metabolites to honeybees. The majority of data indicated a dietary no observed lethal-effect concentration >0.04 and 0.02 mg/L 50% sucrose solution, respectively, for an acute and a chronic dietary exposure of honeybees to either imidacloprid or its plant metabolites. Findings of chronic feeding studies with those plant metabolites where the toxophor had already been cleaved did not support the hypotheses of a novel pharmacologic mechanism unrelated to the parent toxophor. No increased treatment-related mortality or behavioral abnormalities were recorded in four independent research facilities during a 10-day dietary exposure of honeybees of different ages to sucrose solutions spiked with the respective metabolites at 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.010 mg/L 50% sucrose solution.",2004,10.1007/s00244-004-3057-6,47,0.0,0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,
Effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide on thermoregulation of African honey bees (Apis mellifera scutellata),911,JOUR,"['Tosi, S.', 'Démares, F.J.', 'Nicolson, S.W.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Pirk, C.W.W.', 'Human, H.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"Thiamethoxam is a widely used neonicotinoid pesticide that, as agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, has been shown to elicit a variety of sublethal effects in honey bees. However, information concerning neonicotinoid effects on honey bee thermoregulation is lacking. Thermoregulation is an essential ability for the honey bee that guarantees the success of foraging and many in-hive tasks, especially brood rearing. We tested the effects of acute exposure to thiamethoxam (0.2, 1, 2 ng/bee) on the thorax temperatures of foragers exposed to low (22 °C) and high (33 °C) temperature environments. Thiamethoxam significantly altered honey bee thorax temperature at all doses tested; the effects elicited varied depending on the environmental temperature and pesticide dose to which individuals were exposed. When bees were exposed to the high temperature environment, the high dose of thiamethoxam increased their thorax temperature 1–2 h after exposure. When bees were exposed to the low temperature, the higher doses of the neonicotinoid reduced bee thorax temperatures 60–90 min after treatment. In both experiments, the neonicotinoid decreased the temperature of bees the day following the exposure. After a cold shock (5 min at 4 °C), the two higher doses elicited a decrease of the thorax temperature, while the lower dose caused an increase, compared to the control. These alterations in thermoregulation caused by thiamethoxam may affect bee foraging activity and a variety of in-hive tasks, likely leading to negative consequences at the colony level.

Standardized tests with Apis mellifera are already common, and there is a need to create adequate parameters for the native solitary and eusocial species of stingless bees. In this study, we evaluated lethal dosages (LD50 and LD90), lethal time (LT), and sub-lethal effects (SLE) of two pesticides used in soybean crops, abamectin, and acetamiprid, in Scaptotrigona aff. xanthotricha. All tests were performed through contact poisoning. The LD50 and LD90 for acetamiprid were higher than those obtained for abamectin. Survival analysis of S. aff. xanthotricha exposed to LD90 indicated significant differences between pesticides. The LT50 under abamectin (8.25 hours) was significantly lower than acetamiprid (14.25 hours). Considering the PER tests, our results suggest that positive responses to food offerings were reduced by pesticide effects. It was also observed that only the acetamiprid affected the locomotion of the bees.

We evaluated the survival and hypopharyngeal gland development of adult worker honey bees, and the survival of the worker brood when chronically exposed to thiamethoxam or thiamethoxam and prothioconazole in combination. RESULTS: We found that 30 days of exposure to 40 μg kg–1 of thiamethoxam significantly (P < 0.001) increased the frequency of death in worker adults by four times relative to solvent control. The worker brood required 23 times higher doses of thiamethoxam (1 mg L–1 or 909 μg kg–1) before a significant (P = 0.04), 3.9 times increase in frequency of death was observed relative to solvent control. No additive effects of simultaneous exposure of worker adults or brood to thiamethoxam and prothioconazole were observed. At day 8 and day 12, the hypopharyngeal gland acinar diameter was not significantly different (P > 0.05) between controls and adult workers exposed to thiamethoxam and/or prothioconazole. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that chronic exposure to field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam and/or prothioconazole are unlikely to affect the survival of adult workers and brood. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2020,10.1002/ps.5501,76,,0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,
Effects of chronic exposure to the new insecticide sulfoxaflor in combination with a SDHI fungicide in a solitary bee,523,JOUR,"['Azpiazu, C.', 'Bosch, J.', 'Martins, C.', 'Sgolastra, F.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The recent EU ban of the three most widely used neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin) to all outdoors applications has stimulated the introduction of new insecticides into the market. Sulfoxaflor is a new systemic insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agro-environments, bees can be exposed to this compound via contaminated pollen and nectar for long periods of time. Therefore, it is important to assess the potential effects of chronic exposure to sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with fungicides, on pollinators. In this study, we tested the effects of chronic exposure to two field concentrations of sulfoxaflor (20 and 100 ppb) alone and in combination with four concentrations of the fungicide fluxapyroxad (7500, 15,000, 30,000 and 60,000 ppb) on syrup consumption and longevity in females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. Exposure to 20 ppb of sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with the fungicide, stimulated syrup consumption, but did not affect longevity. In contrast, syrup consumption decreased in bees exposed to 100 ppb, all of which died after 2–6 days of exposure. We found no evidence of synergism between the two compounds at any of the two sulfoxaflor concentrations tested. Comparison of our findings with the literature, confirms that O. bicornis is more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than honey bees. Our results highlight the need to include different bee species in risk assessment schemes. © 2022 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157822,850,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

Recently, interactive effects of multiple agrochemicals on bees have been highlighted, including fungicides, which increase toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we use a semi-field study across two seasons in controlled foraging tunnels to test the effects of a field application of a commercial fungicide product with two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin and metconazole) applied at label rates. We also examine its interactive effects with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, at a conservative field-realistic dose of 2.23 ppb, on 48 honey bee colonies. We found combined effects of pesticide exposure, including additive 2.93-fold increases in mortality, and an additional effect of increased infestation levels of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Pesticide treatments also reduced colony activity, reduced colony weight, and increased sugar consumption of whole colonies. These findings indicate that typical sublethal exposure levels to common, co-occurring agrochemicals in the field significantly affect the health of whole honey bee colonies, highlighting an unintended consequence of increasing pesticide applications. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29886,10,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Newly emerged worker bees were exposed to organophosphate insecticide coumaphos, a neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and their mixtures. Toxicity tests were conducted along with bee midgut immunohistological TUNEL analyses. RT-qPCR assessed the regulation of 10 bee antioxidant genes linked to pesticide toxicity. We tested coumaphos at 92,600 ppb concentration, in combination with 5 and 20 ppb imidacloprid. Coumaphos induced significantly higher bee mortality, which was associated with down regulation of catalase compared to coumaphos and imidacloprid (5/20 ppb) mixtures, whereas, both imidacloprid concentrations independently had no effect on bee mortality. Mixture of coumaphos and imidacloprid reduced daily bee consumption of a control food patty to 10 mg from a coumaphos intake of 14.3 mg and 18.4 and 13.7 mg for imidacloprid (5 and 20) ppb, respectively. While coumaphos and imidacloprid mixtures induced down-regulation of antioxidant genes with noticeable midgut tissue damage, imidacloprid induced intensive gene up-regulations with less midgut apoptosis. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,10.1038/s41598-018-33348-4,8,,0,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

The experimental maize crops were adjacent to the other flowering agriculture plants. Honey bee colonies were placed in three differently protected maize fields throughout the blooming period, and thereafter they were transferred to a stationary apiary. Samples of pollen loads, bee bread, and adult bees were collected and analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of detection of the analyzed pesticides, a modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used. Clothianidin was detected only in the samples of pollen loads. Their residue levels ranged from 10.0 to 41.0 ng/g (average 27.0 ng/g). Imidacloprid was found in no investigated sample. No negative effects of neonicotinoid seed-treated maize on the development and long-term survival of honey bee colonies were observed. The low proportion of Zea mays pollen in total bee-collected pollen during the maize flowering period was noted. The findings suggest that maize plants are less attractive forage for honey bees than phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum Mill.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), goldenrod (Solidago L.), and vegetation from Brassicaceae family.

After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen.

Beekeepers in the Wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria) reported unusual losses and deaths of bee colonies in the places where imidacloprid insecticide was used. Even at sublethal doses, insecticide can affect tasks performed by workers in a colony, such as comb building. The study investigated the effect of an imidacloprid based insecticide (Confidor®Supra) on the production of wax by the honeybee Apis mellifera intermissa. After the imidacloprid LD50 was determined in controlled conditions, three sublethal doses were tested. The mortality of the bees, syrup consumption and the weight of the wax generated were recorded. The imidacloprid insecticide LD50 at 48 hours was 3.5 ng bee–1 for 4-day old spring worker bees. The three sublethal doses (0.175 mg L–1, 0.087 mg L–1 and 0.035 mg L–1) had an impact on the syrup consumption and the wax production of adult bees. Bees exposed to sublethal doses of insecticide consumed less syrup and produced less wax (between 0.040–0.415 g) than the bees in the control (0.745 g). A dose response was observed regarding the production of wax. This impact could have harmful consequences for bee colonies, as wax production is the basis of comb building.

"Effects of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, on reproduction in worker bumble bees (Bombus terrestris)",981,JOUR,"['Laycock, I.', 'Lenthall, K.M.', 'Barratt, A.T.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecotoxicology,"Bumble bees are important pollinators whose populations have declined over recent years, raising widespread concern. One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 μg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",2012,10.1007/s10646-012-0927-y,21,,0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

In the last years, several studies have reported severe secondary effects on various bee species, including exotic and native bees. In this study, lethal (mortality) and sublethal (locomotor activity) effects of insecticides and acaricides used in strawberries in Brazil (abamectin, novaluron, spinetoram, and thiamethoxam) were evaluated on the native stingless beesMelipona quadrifasciataandTetragonisca fiebrigi. The results showed that the effects varied significantly according to the pesticide, type of exposure (oral or topical), and bee species. Through oral exposure,M. quadrifasciatawas more susceptible to all insecticides except for abamectin, while in topical exposure,T. fiebrigiwas more sensitive. Thiamethoxam followed by spinetoram and abamectin were the most lethal, regardless of species or exposure route; novaluron was not harmful at the highest tested dose. The locomotor activity of bees was altered in the presence of sublethal doses (LC(10)and LC50) of all insecticides. Spinetoram and abamectin can be as much as toxic as thiamethoxam againstM. quadrifasciataandT. fiebrigiin laboratory experiments.

Effects of neonicotinoid dust from maize seed-dressing on honey bees,989,JOUR,"['Sgolastra, F.', 'Renzi, T.', 'Draghetti, S.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Lodesani, M.', 'Maini, S.', 'Porrini, C.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"In Northern Italy from 2000 to 2008, many spring bee mortalities were clearly linked to sowing of maize seeds dressed with insecticides. In the present study, we investigated the effects on honey bees of clothianidin derived from maize seed-dressing (Poncho®) in laboratory (test by indirect contact) and in semi-field conditions. Despite the reduction of dust dispersion due to the application of the best available sowing techniques (pneumatic seeder equipped with deflector, improvement of seed-dressing quality) our results showed negative effects on honey bees at individual level. In semi-field study, no effect was observed at the colony level despite the high bee mortality rate for 2-3 days after dust application. However, we can expect a colony decline and low honey production if this high forager mortality rate lasts for longer than 10 days. Such a situation is possible if the sowing period lasts several days as in the Po Valley, where the landscape is characterized by extended maize cultivation. Specific methodologies to assess the effects of dust have never been included in the official guidelines for the evaluation of side-effects of plant protection products on honey bees. For this reason, suitable and standardized methods for testing in laboratory and in semi-field conditions the effects on honey bees of contaminated dust dispersed during sowing were evaluated.",2012,,65,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Effects of neonicotinoid exposure on molecular and physiological indicators of honey bee immunocompetence,796,JOUR,"['Collison, E.J.', 'Hird, H.', 'Tyler, C.R.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Apidologie,"Bee declines have been associated with various stressors including pesticides and pathogens. We separately exposed immune-challenged adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to two neonicotinoid pesticides, thiamethoxam (10 ppb) and imidacloprid (102 ppb), by dietary delivery. We found that whereas neonicotinoid exposure weakly affected transcriptional responses of antimicrobial genes, it did not detectably affect the physiological antimicrobial response as measured by a lytic clearance assay of haemolymph. Our findings add to the evidence that transcriptional responses in immune-related genes are not yet reliable indicators of pesticide impacts on bee health, which suggests caution in their future use as biomarkers in pesticide risk assessment. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS.",2018,10.1007/s13592-017-0541-3,49,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation,844,JOUR,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Environmental Entomology,"Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. © The Author(s) 2017.

Effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure and monofloral diet on nest-founding bumblebee queens,811,JOUR,"['Leza, M.', 'Watrous, K.M.', 'Bratu, J.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Bumblebees are among the world’s most important groups of pollinating insects in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Each spring, queen bumblebees emerge from overwintering and initiate new nests, which ultimately give rise to workers and new reproductives later in the season. Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We performed the first laboratory experiment with the model bumblebee species Bombus impatiens that explores how early nesting success is impacted by the effects of temporary or more sustained exposure to sublethal levels of a neonicotinoid-type insecticide (imidacloprid at 5 ppb in nectar) and by reliance on a monofloral pollen diet, two factors that have been previously implicated in bumblebee decline. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production. These findings speak to the sensitivity of queen bumblebees during the nest initiation phase of the colony cycle, with implications for how queens and their young nests are uniquely impacted by exposure to threats such as pesticide exposure and foraging habitat unsuitability. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

A growing body of research is demonstrating that, through various exposure routes, neonicotinoids can impact a suite of nontarget organisms including beneficial insects such as bees. However, to date, only a few studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoids in field settings. We assessed the relationship between agricultural crop soil neonicotinoid levels and wild bee abundance and diversity at 16 agricultural sites representing different soil neonicotinoid levels. We detected clothianidin at 11 sites, thiamethoxam at three sites; imidacloprid was not detected. Hedgerow and crop soils were consistent in terms of where clothianidin was detected; thiamethoxan was not detected in hedgerow soils. Based on model outcomes, fields with higher levels of soil neonicotinoids exhibited significantly lower wild bee abundance and diversity than those with low or no neonicotinoids detected. Crop soil neonicotinoid level, hedgerow floral resource abundance and crop type were consistent predictors of bee abundance across models; only neonicotinoid level and crop type were significant predictors of diversity. Our results are consistent with recent findings in the midwestern US, and underscore the potential risk of soil neonicotinoids to wild bee populations across regions and crop systems. © 2022 The Royal Entomological Society.",2023,10.1111/afe.12530,25,1.0,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,
Effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee autogrooming behavior against the tracheal mite Acarapis woodi,607,JOUR,"['Sakamoto, Y.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Maeda, T.', 'Goka, K.']",Ecotoxicology,"The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most common and important pollinator of crops worldwide. Honey bees are damaged by destructive parasitic mites, but they also have evolved a behavioral immune system to remove them. Exposures to neonicotinoids, however, can cause significant behavioral effects because these compounds alter the central role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in insect brains. In this study, we assessed the effects of three neonicotinoids that have a high toxicity to bees—imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin—on the behavioral immune system of honey bees. We used A. mellifera and the endoparasitic mite Acarapis woodi as a behavioral immune system model because A. mellifera can effectively remove the mite by autogrooming. Our results did not demonstrate an effect of neonicotinoid application on whether bees show autogrooming or on mite removal, but the time to initial autogrooming became shorter and the number of autogrooming attempts increased. As opposed to previous studies, our findings indicate that the honey bee response to parasitic mites becomes more sensitive after exposure to neonicotinoids.

Effects of novel pesticides on bumble bee (Hymenoptera.

In the first experiment, B. occidentalis colonies were exposed to realistic residue levels of CrylAc, chitinase, and imidacloprid found in pollen. There were no effects on pollen consumption, bumble bee worker weights, colony size, amount of brood, or the number of queens and males produced. In the second experiment, using B. impatiens, we tested the effects of CrylAc and two levels of imidacloprid. Similar colony health measures were collected as in the first experiment, but in addition foraging ability of individual bees was tested on complex artificial flowers. There were no differences in colony characteristics among treatments. However, bees in the high-imidacloprid treatment had longer handling times on the complex flowers than bees in the other treatments. No lethal, sublethal colony, or individual foraging effects of these novel pesticides were found at residue levels found in the field, suggesting that bumble bee colonies will not be harmed by proper use of these pesticides. Use of an artificial flower foraging array proved to be a sensitive method for detecting sublethal response of bees to pesticides.",2003,10.1603/0046-225X-32.3.555,32,,0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Effects of octopamine on memory retention under chemical stress: a behavioral study on honey bees,439,JOUR,"['Khooshe-Bast, Z.', 'Sahebzadeh, N.', 'Tahmasbi, G.', 'Haddadi, M.', 'Khani, A.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Honey bees may experience the adverse effects of environmental contaminants when exposed during foraging trips, or something to that effect. We hypothesized that octopamine (OA), with important functions in reward signaling and learning, can improve the behavior of honey bees under chemical stress. Memory retention and sucrose responsiveness were evaluated using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. The one-day-old bees were exposed separately to diazinon, imidacloprid, paraquat, manganese, and thymol at concentrations of 0.22, 29.04, 55.69, 106.19, and 0.91 ppm, respectively. On the 21st day of exposure, the bees’ responses to memory retention and sucrose responsiveness experiments were recorded after the training trial. In addition, PERs were recorded after OA injection. During the intervals, honey bees were exposed to the toxins topically. The expression levels of OA receptor genes, AmoctαR1 and AmoctβR4, were measured. The sucrose responsiveness tests showed no significant differences between the bees stimulated with the control solutions or toxins. Moreover, our results indicated that memory retention significantly declined in honey bees exposed to toxins compared to the controls (P≤0.05). According to the findings, OA improved the memory retention of honey bees exposed to toxins (P≤0.05). The expression levels of AmoctαR1 and AmoctβR4 genes significantly increased in the treated honey bees, especially those exposed to paraquat and manganese, after 30 min post-OA injection. It can be concluded that under chemical stress, OA administration encouraged honey bees to respond to a stimulus. Therefore, it can be added to a nutrient-enriched diet. © 2023 International Bee Research Association.",2024,10.1080/00218839.2023.2186018,63,,0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

The tests were carried out in vitro on caged bees. Significantly lower mortality rate was observed in intoxicated bees treated by a mixture of phenolic compounds compared with the intoxicated and the untreated bees. It resulted probably from increased detoxification abilities of bees (due to increased phenol content and antioxidant activity in bee bodies).

Multiple factors like parasites, pathogens and pesticides are dealt as possible drivers of honeybee losses. In particular, insecticides are considered as a major factor of pollinator poisoning. We applied sublethal concentrations of four insecticidal substances to honeybee larval food and analyzed the effects on transcriptome. The aim was to identify candidate genes indicating early negative impacts after application of insecticidal substances. Honeybee larvae were kept in-vitro under hive conditions (34–35 °C) and fed with dimethoate, fenoxycarb, chlorantraniliprole and flupyradifurone in sublethal concentrations between day 3–6 after grafting. Larvae at day 4, 6 and 8 were sampled and their transcriptome analyzed. By use of a RT-qPCR array differences in gene expression of selected gene families (immune system, development detoxification) were measured. Targets mainly involved in development, energy metabolism and the immune system were significantly affected by the insecticidal substances tested, selectively inducing genes of the detoxification system, immune response and nutritional stress. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104703,170,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Both amitraz and thiacloprid have been proven less toxic to honey bees and are frequently applied in- and out-hive, respectively. We examined the sub-lethal effects of amitraz, thiacloprid and their sequential exposure on learning, memory and sugar responsiveness in Apis mellifera using the Proboscis extension response (PER). Sub-lethal doses of amitraz (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 µg/bee) and thiacloprid (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 µg/bee) were tested. Sub-lethal effects were observed only at the highest doses of each pesticide treatment; amitraz (0.4 µg/bee) and thiacloprid (0.2 µg/bee) but not in lower doses. In sequential treatment of amitraz and thiacloprid, reduced acquisition and memory retention were significant across all tested doses. The same profile was also obtained on sugar responsiveness of foragers. Our results suggest that the sequential exposure would pose higher risk to honey bee compared to single pesticide exposure by reducing the bees’ appetitive olfactory learning, memory and sugar acuity more than individual pesticide exposures. © 2021 Korean Society of Applied Entomology",2021,10.1016/j.aspen.2021.03.012,24,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

However, little is known about the physiological effects of sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate exposure on bumblebees. We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5 mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10 days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, α-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut α-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activity of prophenoloxidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition. Our results provide information on the sublethal effects of exposure to low concentrations of glyphosate and spinetoram on bumblebees in terms of physiology and gut microbes.

Acetamiprid is a new class of insecticide and a member of the neonicotinoids that has been widely applied in the field for pest control. However, effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on worker bees are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on lifespan and memory-related characteristics. Newly emerged worker bees from a single colony were randomly divided into four groups, and this experiment was repeated three times using three different colonies. Three doses (0.5, 1, and 2 μg/bee) of acetamiprid diluted by water were added on the thorax of worker bees while bees were exposed to pure water as a control (0 μg/bee). The lifespan of bees treated with acetamiprid at a concentration over 1 μg/bee was significantly reduced, while there was no significant difference between the 0.5 μg/bee group and 0 μg/bee group. All three doses of acetamiprid affected the memory-related characteristics of bees, reduced the success of proboscis extension response (PER), affected homing ability, and influenced expression levels of two learning- and memory-related genes compared with the control group.

The interaction between sublethal doses of a neurotoxin, clothianidin, and the ectoparasite, Varroa destructor, was examined by measuring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brains, deformed wing virus (DWV) and the proportion and intensity of self-grooming. Evidence for an interaction was observed between the stressors in a reduction in the proportion of intense groomers. Only the lowest dose of clothianidin alone reduced the proportion of self-groomers and increased DWV levels. V. destructor shared a higher proportion of DEGs with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin, indicating that the effects of V. destructor were more pervasive than those of clothianidin when they were combined. The number of up-regulated DEGs were reduced with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin alone, suggesting an interference with the impacts of clothianidin. Clothianidin and V. destructor affected DEGs from different biological pathways but shared impacts on pathways related to neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s, which could be related to neurological dysfunction and may explain their negative impacts on grooming.

Taking into account bees' contributions to other flowering agricultural crops, about one-third of our total diet comes directly or indirectly from bee-pollinated plants. However, in recent years there increasingly have been worrisome alarm sounds on serious bee mortalities and mysterious disappearance of bees from beehives. Among several environmental factors (e.g. climate and bee pathogens), stress factors arising from agricultural practices can potentially play a role in bee losses. Detailed knowledge on the effects of plant protection products is essential to improve usage with minimal risks. In order to identify potential medium- and long-term effects, we followed up various sublethal contaminated hives during the prolongation of the fruit-growing season. More specifically, a large-scale experiment was conducted in which at four distinct locations (in the Limburg region of Belgium) four different bee colonies (representing three different contaminations -imidacloprid, fenoxycarb, indoxacarb- and a non-contaminated control hive) were thoroughly monitored every 2-7 days. Our observations point towards decays of overall colony vitality for several hives a couple of weeks after treatment, as indicated by a set of carefully assessed parameters including the total amount of active and dead bees, total surface of capped brood and overall colony weight. These outcomes could be linked to subtle differences in foraging activity between distinct hives. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of potential short-term and long-term consequences of disturbed foraging ability triggered by exaggerated exposure to sublethal doses of crop protection chemicals, and its potential impact on colony health.",2009,,74,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

The active ingredient imidacloprid has action on the nervous system of the insects. However, little has been studied about the actions of the insecticide on nontarget organs of insects, such as the Malpighian tubules that make up the excretory and osmoregulatory system. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid in Malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera. In the tubules of treated bees, we found an increase in the number of cells with picnotic nuclei, the lost of part of the cell into the lumen, and a homogenization of coloring cytoplasm. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolization. We confirmed the increased occurrence of picnotic nuclei by using the Feulgan reaction, which showed the chromatin compaction was more intense in the tubules of bees exposed to the insecticide. We observed an intensification of the staining of the nucleus with Xylidine Ponceau, further verifying the cytoplasmic negative regions that may indicate autophagic activity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry experiments showed TUNEL positive nuclei in exposed bees, implicating increased cell apoptosis after chronic imidacloprid exposure. In conclusion, our results indicate that very low concentrations of imidacloprid lead to cytotoxic activity in the Malpighian tubules of exposed bees at all tested times for exposure and imply that this insecticide can alter honey bee physiology. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013,10.1002/jemt.22199,76,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

In contrast to applications of single PPPs the effects of tank mixtures are not routinely evaluated in the risk assessment process of PPPs with the exception of known synergistic insecticides and mixing partners. Due to economi-cal constraints and process efficiency PPP mixtures are commonly used in agricultural practices. However, some-times interactions among agrochemicals lead to undesir-able additive and synergistic effects. Especially mixtures of pyrethroids or neonicotinoids with azole fungicides, which inhibit sterol biosynthesis, have a synergistic potential of negatively affecting honey bees. For such mixtures, regulatory restrictions are already in place. These synergistic effects are associated with azole fungicides inhibiting the main detoxification enzyme P450, which hinders the bee to detoxify the insecticide. Further studies provide first evidence for increased impacts of mixtures of insecticides with adjuvants on honey bees.

Effects of the Neonicotinoid Acetamiprid in Pollen on Bombus impatiens Microcolony Development,686,JOUR,"['Camp, A.A.', 'Batres, M.A.', 'Williams, W.C.', 'Koethe, R.W.', 'Stoner, K.A.', 'Lehmann, D.M.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Honey bees and other wild bee species including bumble bees have experienced population declines in recent decades. Although many stressors are implicated in bee population declines, much attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, which are widely used and known to be toxic to pollinators. One neonicotinoid, acetamiprid, has been studied very little in bumble bees, despite its use on bumble bee–pollinated crops. We assessed the impacts of acetamiprid to the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens using the microcolony model. We examined nest growth, development, and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in pollen (4520 µg/kg) significantly impacted nest growth, development, and, ultimately, reproduction (drone production). We found the no-observable–adverse effect level to be 45.2 µg/kg. Overall, acetamiprid has the potential to negatively impact reproductive endpoints for B. impatiens. However, effects occurred at concentrations substantially higher than expected environmental concentrations that would be achieved when following label rates. Further work is required to assess the effects of this pesticide on B. impatiens via alternate routes of exposure and on queenright colonies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;39:2560–2569. © 2020 SETAC.

Effects of the insecticide acetamiprid and the fungicide azoxystrobin on locomotion activity and mushroom bodies of solitary bee Centris analis,391,JOUR,"['Tadei, R.', 'Silva, C.I.D.', 'Mathias da Silva, E.C.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Chemosphere,"Pesticide use is a major factor contributing to the global decline in bee populations. Sublethal effects, such as behavior alterations, are neglected in pesticide regulation for pollinators. However, these effects can bring important information to understanding the impacts of pesticides on bees' daily activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/μL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/μL) on the behavior of the Neotropical solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male bees were exposed to these chemicals continuously for 48 h, followed by an additional 48 h without contaminated food, totaling 96 h of observation. We used five experimental groups: control, solvent control, insecticide, fungicide, and pesticide mixture (insecticide + fungicide). Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli. Bees exposed to acetamiprid and pesticide mixture showed lethargic movements and impaired locomotion at 48 h. Notably, these behavioral effects were no longer evident after the bees consumed uncontaminated food for an additional 48 h, totaling 96 h from the start of pesticide exposure. Only fungicide exposure did not result in any behavioral or brain histological changes. Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees. These findings highlight the importance of considering sublethal effects in environmental risk assessment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143254,364,,0,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

Imidacloprid is a widely used systemic insecticide that can be found in the pollen and nectar of plants and has the potential to negatively impact the development of bee larvae. We investigated the effects of oral exposure to a realistic field concentration (20.5 ng g−1) of imidacloprid on the midgut and fat body of Apis mellifera worker larvae. Our results showed that larvae exposed to imidacloprid exhibited changes in the midgut epithelium, including disorganization of the brush border, nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasm vacuolization, and release of cell fragments indication cell death. Additionally, histochemical analysis revealed that the midgut brush border glycocalyx was disorganized in exposed larvae. The fat body cells of imidacloprid-exposed larvae had a decrease in the size of lipid droplets from 50 to 8 μm and increase of 100 % of protein content, suggesting possible responses to the stress caused by the insecticide. However, the expression of de cdc20 gene, which plays a role in cell proliferation, was not affected in the midgut and fat body of treated larvae.

Effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in syrup on Bombus impatiens (Hymenoptera: Apidae) microcolony development,692,JOUR,"['Camp, A.A.', 'Williams, W.C.', 'Eitzer, B.D.', 'Koethe, R.W.', 'Lehmann, D.M.']",PLoS ONE,"Worldwide, many pollinator populations are in decline. Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 μg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 μg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 μg/L. Overall, acetamiprid delivered in syrup can negatively impact B. impatiens nest development and productivity, however only at concentrations above which would be expected in the environment when used according to label rates.

Effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam at field-realistic levels on microcolonies of Bombus terrestris worker bumble bees,958,JOUR,"['Laycock, I.', 'Cotterell, K.C.', ""O'Shea-Wheller, T.A."", 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently implicated in the decline of wild bee populations. Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98μgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98μg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98μgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11μgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100,,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Effects of thiamethoxam and spinosad on the survival and hypopharyngeal glands of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera intermissa),1025,JOUR,"['Menail, AH', 'Boutefnouchet-Bouchema, WF', 'Haddad, N', 'Taning, CNT', 'Smagghe, G', 'Loucif-Ayad, W']",ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS,"Insecticides can affect development and survival of non-target and beneficial arthropods like honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Thiamethoxam and spinosad are widely used as pesticides in agriculture but they have become an important concern for beekeepers and researchers focusing on bee health; multiple reports stressed adverse effects on bees, notably on honey bees. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two insecticides on the development of the HPGs and on the survival of Apis mellifera intermissa a native African subspecies of honey bee present in Algeria. Newly emerged workers were acutely and chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and spinosad through sugar syrup and pollen pastry. The effects of these insecticides were assessed by measuring the size of HPGs acini and the total head protein content. The survival of the workers was also evaluated over 60 days when they were chronically exposed to the insecticides at concentrations corresponding to LC25 and LC10. We found that the insecticide-treated workers, after both acute and chronic exposure, exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped HPG acini. The total head protein content also decreased in treated individuals with the two concentrations of insecticides at day 6 and 9 compared to the respective controls. While the control group exhibited an LC25 (i.e. the time needed to kill 50% of the tested workers) of 22 days, the LC25 was only 3 days for the workers exposed to the LC25 of spinosad and all workers were dead at day 17. In contrast, thiamethoxam exposure at LC25 had no significant detrimental effect on honey bee survival.

Many studies showed that neonicotinoid pesticides harm honeybee learning and farming activities, negatively affect colony adaptation and reduce pollination abilities. Bumblebees are heavily preferred species all over the world in order to ensure pollination in plant production. In this study, sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the brain of Bombus terrestris workers were analyzed. Suspensions (1/1000, 1/100, 1/10) of the maximum recommended dose of thiamethoxam were applied to the workers. 48 h after spraying, morphological effects on the brains of workers were studied. According to area measurements of ICC's of Kenyon cells, there was a significant difference between 1/10 dose and all groups. On the other hand, areas of INC's of Kenyon cells showed a significant difference between the control group and all dose groups. Neuropil disorganization in the calyces increased gradually and differed significantly between the groups and was mostly detected at the highest dose (1/10). Apart from optic lobes, pycnotic nuclei were also observed in the middle region of calyces of mushroom bodies in the high dose group. Also, the width of the lamina, medulla and lobula parts of the optic lobes of each group and the areas of the antennal lobes were measured and significant differences were determined between the groups.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of thiamethoxam and clothianidin used for seed treatment of winter and spring rape (Brassica napus L.) on honey bees under Lithuanian conditions and to quantify the levels of neonicotinoids in the dust released during the sowing operation. Honey bee colonies were established for further field testing and sample collection. The samples of nectar, pollen and bee bread were analysed for neonicotinoid residues. The potential impact of the seed treatment with thiamethoxam and clothianidin on the normally developed bee colonies was investigated in 2017 and 2018. The obtained findings suggest that when sowing neonicotinoid-treated winter and spring rape seed in a dry soil, the concentrations of neonicotinoids in the dust released during the sowing operation were three times as high as the maximum permitted limit (0.05 mg kg-1) set by the European Committee for bee products. The residue levels of neonicotinoids detected in the honey, pollen and bee bread samples were minimal (±0.01 ng g-1).

Enantioselective toxicity of the neonicotinoid dinotefuran on honeybee (Apis mellifera) larvae,376,JOUR,"['Sun, J.', 'Wu, J.', 'Zhang, X.', 'Wei, Q.', 'Kang, W.', 'Wang, F.', 'Liu, F.', 'Zhao, M.', 'Xu, S.', 'Han, B.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The threat of neonicotinoids to insect pollinators, particularly honeybees (Apis mellifera), is a global concern, but the risk of chiral neonicotinoids to insect larvae remains poorly understood. In the current study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honeybee larvae in vitro and explored the mechanism of toxicity. The results showed that the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of S-dinotefuran to honeybee larvae was 30.0 μg/larva after oral exposure for 72 h, which was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran (92.7 μg/larva) and R-dinotefuran (183.6 μg/larva). Although the acute toxicity of the three forms of dinotefuran to larvae was lower than that to adults, chronic exposure significantly reduced larval survival, larval weight, and weight of newly emerged adults. Analysis of gene expression and hormone titer indicated that dinotefuran affects larval growth and development by interfering with nutrient digestion and absorption and the molting system. Analysis of hemolymph metabolome further revealed that disturbances in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and energy metabolism are the key mechanisms of dinotefuran toxicity to bee larvae. In addition, melatonin and vitellogenin are used by larvae to cope with dinotefuran-induced oxidative stress.

Enhancement of chronic bee paralysis virus levels in honeybees acute exposed to imidacloprid: A Chinese case study,818,JOUR,"['Diao, Q.', 'Li, B.', 'Zhao, H.', 'Wu, Y.', 'Guo, R.', 'Dai, P.', 'Chen, D.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Hou, C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Though honeybee populations have not yet been reported to be largely lost in China, many stressors that affect the health of honeybees have been confirmed. Honeybees inevitably come into contact with environmental stressors that are not intended to target honeybees, such as pesticides. Although large-scale losses of honeybee colonies are thought to be associated with viruses, these viruses usually lead to covert infections and to not cause acute damage if the bees do not encounter outside stressors. To reveal the potential relationship between acute pesticides and viruses, we applied different doses of imidacloprid to adult bees that were primarily infected with low levels (4.3 × 105 genome copies) of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) to observe whether the acute oral toxicity of imidacloprid was able to elevate the level of CBPV. Here, we found that the titer of CBPV was significantly elevated in adult bees after 96 h of acute treatment with imidacloprid at the highest dose 66.9 ng/bee compared with other treatments and controls. Our study provides clear evidence that exposure to acute high doses of imidacloprid in honeybees persistently infected by CBPV can exert a remarkably negative effect on honeybee survival. These results imply that acute environmental stressors might be one of the major accelerators causing rapid viral replication, which may progress to cause mass proliferation and dissemination and lead to colony decline. The present study will be useful for better understanding the harm caused by this pesticide, especially regarding how honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might be altered by acute pesticide exposure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.258,630,,0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,
"Environmental impacts of reduced-risk and conventional pesticide programs differ in commercial apple orchards, but similarly influence pollinator community",145,JOUR,"['Joshi, NK', 'Leslie, T', 'Rajotte, EG', 'Biddinger, DJ']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Insect pollinators such as bees and syrphid flies play a crucial role in pollinating many food crops, and their diversity and abundance may be influenced by pesticide application patterns. Over three years, we assessed the ecotoxicological impacts on the diversity and abundance of bees and syrphid flies between reduced-risk pesticide programs and standard, conventional pesticide programs in paired plots at six spatially distinct commercial apple orchards. In particular, we quantified pesticide inputs, environmental impact, and community response of bees and syrphids to these pesticide programs. Relative environmental impacts of reduced-risk versus conventional pesticide programs were calculated using Environmental Impact Quotient analysis, while ecological impacts were characterized by assessing the abundance, richness, and species assemblages of bees and syrphids. Adopting a reduced-risk pesticide program for apple pest management reduced the use (in terms of kg a.i./ha) of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides by approximately 97.6% and 100% respectively, but increased the use of neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid) by 40.4% compared to the orchards under standard conventional pesticide program. Regardless of pesticide inputs, abundance, richness and species assemblages of bees and syrphids did not differ between reduced-risk and conventional pest management programs. However, the environmental impact of pesticide inputs was reduced by 89.8% in reduced-risk pesticide program. These findings suggest that the implementation of reduced-risk pesticide program may reduce pesticide environmental impact, in addition to being safer to farm workers, without adversely affecting the robust community composition of bees and syrphids in commercial apple orchards in the mid-Atlantic region.

After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively). The responses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaEs-1-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP. Thus, this set of honeybee biomarkers appears to be a promising tool to evaluate environmental and honeybee health, and it could generate fingerprints to characterize exposures to pesticides.

Enzymatic responses in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera contaminated with a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam,621,JOUR,"['Decio, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Pereira, F.D.C.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'Marin-Morales, M.A.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The increasing use of insecticides, promoted by the intensification of agriculture, has raised concerns about their influence on the decline of bee colonies, which play a fundamental role in pollination. Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/μL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees.

Equivocal evidence for colony level stress effects on bumble bee pollination services,725,JOUR,"['Greenop, A.', 'Mica-Hawkyard, N.', 'Walkington, S.', 'Wilby, A.', 'Cook, S.M.', 'Pywell, R.F.', 'Woodcock, B.A.']",Insects,"Climate change poses a threat to global food security with extreme heat events causing drought and direct damage to crop plants. However, by altering behavioural or physiological responses of insects, extreme heat events may also affect pollination services on which many crops are dependent. Such effects may potentially be exacerbated by other environmental stresses, such as exposure to widely used agro-chemicals. To determine whether environmental stressors interact to affect pollination services, we carried out field cage experiments on the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris). Using a Bayesian approach, we assessed whether heat stress (colonies maintained at an ambient temperature of 25◦C or 31◦C) and insecticide exposure (5 ng g–1 of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin) could induce behavioural changes that affected pollination of faba bean (Vicia faba). Only the bumble bee colonies and not the plants were exposed to the environmental stress treatments. Bean plants exposed to heat-stressed bumble bee colonies (31◦C) had a lower proportional pod set compared to colonies maintained at 25◦C. There was also weak evidence that heat stressed colonies caused lower total bean weight. Bee exposure to clothianidin was found to have no clear effect on plant yields, either individually or as part of an interaction. We identified no effect of either colony stressor on bumble bee foraging behaviours. Our results suggest that extreme heat stress at the colony level may impact on pollination services. However, as the effect for other key yield parameters was weaker (e.g., bean yields), our results are not conclusive. Overall, our study highlights the need for further research on how environmental stress affects behavioural interactions in plant-pollinator systems that could impact on crop yields. © 2020 by the authors.

Eusocial insect declines: Insecticide impairs sperm and feeding glands in bumblebees,323,JOUR,"['Minnameyer, A', 'Strobl, V', 'Bruckner, S', 'Camenzind, DW', 'Van Oystaeyen, A', 'Wäckers, F', 'Williams, GR', 'Yañez, O', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Insecticides are contributing to global insect declines, thereby creating demand to understand the mechanisms underlying reduced fitness. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of male sexuals (drones) and efficient collaborative brood care by female workers. Therefore, sublethal insecticide effects on sperm and glands used in larval feeding (hypopharyngeal glands (HPG)) would provide key mechanisms for population declines in eusocial insects. However, while negative impacts for bumblebee colony fitness have been documented, the effects of insecticide exposure on individual physiology are less well understood. Here, we show that field-realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam significantly impair Bombus terrestris sperm and HPGs, thereby providing plausible mechanisms underlying bumblebee population decline. In the laboratory, drones and workers were exposed to five thiamethoxam concentrations (4.5 to 1000 ng ml(-1)). Then, survival, food consumption, body mass, HPG development, sperm quantity and viability were assessed. At all concentrations, drones were more exposed than workers due to higher food consumption. Increased body mass was observed in drones starting at 20 ng ml(-1) and in workers at 100 ng ml(-1). Furthermore, environmentally realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) did not significantly affect survival or consumption for either sex. However, thiamethoxam exposure significantly negatively affected both spermviability and HPG development at all tested concentrations. Therefore, the results indicate a trade-off between survival and fitness components, possibly due to costly detoxification. Since sperm and HPG are corner stones of colony fitness, the data offer plausible mechanisms for bumblebee population declines. To adequately mitigate ongoing biodiversity declines for the eusocial insects, this study suggests it is essential to evaluate the impact of insecticides on fitness parameters of both sexuals and workers.

Evaluation of motor changes and toxicity of insecticides Fipronil and imidacloprid in Africanized Honey bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae),873,JOUR,"['Lunardi, J.S.', 'Zaluski, R.', 'Orsi, R.O.']",Sociobiology,"Honey bees are important pollinators and are essential in beekeeping. Honey bees get exposed to systemic pesticides while foraging in contaminated fields, and it is important to know the toxicity (LD50) and evaluate the impacts of bees' exposure to these molecules. Fipronil and imidacloprid are systemic pesticides widely used in Brazil and other countries. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50 (24 hours) and evaluate motor changes in Africanized honey bee foragers exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of fipronil and imidacloprid. To determine the LD50, foraging honey bees were exposed by ingestion and contact to five doses of fipronil (Regent 800WG°) and imidacloprid (Appalus 200SC°) insecticides. After 24 hours of exposure, the number of dead bees was counted, and the results were subjected to probit analysis. The motor activity of bees exposed by ingestion or contact to LD50 and sublethal doses (1/500th of the LD50) of both pesticides was assessed 4 hours after exposure using a behavioral observation box. The ingestion and contact with LD50 of fipronil were 0.0528±0.0090 and 0.0054±0.0041 μg/bee, respectively; the ingestion and contact with LD50 of imidacloprid were 0.0809±0.0135 and 0.0626±0.0080 μg/bee, respectively. Bees exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of both insecticides experienced significant motor alterations compared to the control, except for exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil by contact. Fipronil and imidacloprid are highly toxic and promote motor changes in bees. Thus, it is important to establish management methods to reduce pollinators' exposure to these pesticides.",2017,10.13102/sociobiology.v64i1.1190,64,,0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

A series of experiments were carried out to determine the acute toxicity of pesticides in the laboratory, toxicity through spray on flowering plants of mustard (Tier II evaluation) and field on both Apis cerana and A. mellifera bees. The overall mortality of honey bees through topical (direct contact) were found significantly higher than that of indirect filter paper contamination assays. Insecticides viz., chlorpyriphos, dichlorvos, malathion, profenofos, monocrotophos and deltamethrin when exposed directly or indirectly at their field recommended doses caused very high mortality up to 100% to both the bees at 48 HAT. The insecticides that caused less mortality through filter paper contamination viz., flubendiamide, methyl demeton, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused very high morality through direct exposure. Apart from all the fungicides tested, carbendazim, mancozeb, chlorothalonil and propiconazole, insecticides acetamiprid and endosulfan were found safer to both the bees either by direct or indirect exposures. Tier II evaluation by spray of pesticides at their field recommended doses on potted mustard plants showed monocrotophos as the highly toxic insecticide with 100% mortality even with 1. h of exposure followed by thiamethoxam, dichlorvos, profenofos and chlorpyriphos which are not to be recommended for use in pollinator attractive flowering plants.

Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica,549,JOUR,"['Syama, P.S.', 'Sreeranjit Kumar, C.V.']",Sociobiology,"Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

Their development and survival were followed in parallel with control hives (unfed or fed with saccharose syrup) until the end of the following winter. The parameters followed were: adult bee activity (number of bee entering the hive and pollen carrying activity), adult bee population level, capped brood area, frequency of parasitic and other diseases, mortality, number of frames with brood after wintering and a global score of colonies after wintering. The only parameters linked to feeding with imidacloprid-supplemented saccharose syrup when compared with feeding with non-supplemented syrup were: a statistically non-significant higher activity index of adult bees, a significantly higher frequency of pollen carrying during the feeding period and a larger number of capped brood cells. When imidacloprid was no longer applied, activity and pollen carrying were re-established at a similar level for all groups. Repeated feeding with syrup supplemented with imidacloprid did not provoke any immediate or any delayed mortality before, during or following the next winter, whereas such severe effects are described by several French bee keepers as a consequence of imidacloprid use for seed dressing in neighbouring cultures. In any case, during the whole study, mortality was very low in all groups, with no difference between imidacloprid-fed and control colonies. Further research should now address several hypotheses: the troubles described by bee keepers have causes other than imidacloprid; if such troubles are really due to this insecticide, they may only be observed either when bees consume contaminated pollen, when no other sources of food are available, in the presence of synergic factors (that still need to be identified), with some particular races of bees or when colonies are not strong and healthy. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005,10.1002/ps.957,61,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Exploring the neurotoxicity of chiral dinotefuran towards nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: Enantioselective insights into species selectivity,294,JOUR,"['He, ZC', 'Zhang, T', 'Peng, W', 'Mei, Q', 'Wang, QZ', 'Ding, F']",JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,"Dinotefuran is a chiral neonicotinoid that is widely distributed in environmental matrices, but its health risks to different organisms are poorly understood. This study investigated the neurotoxic responses of honeybee/cotton aphid nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to chiral dinotefuran at the enantiomeric scale and demonstrated the microscopic mechanism of species selectivity in nAChR-mediated enantioselective neurotoxicity. The findings indicated that ( S )-dinotefuran had a higher affinity for honeybee nAChR than ( R )-dinotefuran whereas both enantiomers exhibited similar bioactivity toward cotton aphid nAChR. The results of dynamic neurotoxic processes indicated the association of conformational changes induced by chiral dinotefuran with its macroscopic neurotoxicity, and ( R )-dinotefuran, which exhibit low toxicity to honeybee, was found to induce significant conformational changes in the enantioselective neurotoxic reaction, as supported by the average root -meansquare fluctuation (0.35 nm). Energy decomposition results indicated that electrostatic contribution ( Delta G ele ) is the critical energy term that leads to substantial enantioselectivity, and both Trp-51 ( -2.57 kcal mol - 1 ) and Arg75 ( -4.86 kcal mol - 1 ), which form a hydrogen -bond network, are crucial residues in mediating the species selectivity for enantioselective neurotoxic responses.

This concern arises from their crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and global food production. Therefore, an extensive investigation has been conducted to explore the intricate relationship between pesticides and the biological development of honey bees in the Rahim Yar Khan region. This study assessed the impact of four pesticides (Emamectin benzoate, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid) on honey bee eggs, larvae, and adult bees under controlled laboratory conditions. The pesticides were applied at concentrations of 10%, 30%, and 50%, as per regional agricultural recommendations. A zero-toxicity control was also included for comparison. Toxicity evaluations were conducted through contact exposure, and Probit and regression analyses were performed using SPSS software to comprehensively assess the toxicity profiles. The study revealed significant adverse effects on the immediate behavioral responses of A. mellifera following pesticide exposure. These effects included heightened agitation, narcotic-like symptoms, audible hovering, crawling, ceased food-sharing behavior, and reduced proboscis extension. Chlorpyrifos exhibited the highest toxicity against adult bees, while Emamectin Benzoate had the least toxicity. Regarding honey bee eggs, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid were notably more toxic, whereas Emamectin Benzoate exhibited the least toxicity. The impact on larvae varied across developmental stages and pesticides, with Imidacloprid, Chlorpyrifos, and Acetamiprid causing significant mortality, while Emamectin Benzoate showed lower toxicity. The study highlights that Emamectin Benzoate demonstrates lower toxicity compared to other insecticides. This emphasizes the importance of balancing effective pest management with the preservation of pollinator health. The findings underscore the need for informed and sustainable approaches to pesticide use, taking into consideration the potential repercussions on honeybee development and behavior. © Iqbal, et al.",2024,10.3897/ejfa.2024.122884,2024,,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Exposure of Larvae to Sublethal Thiacloprid Delays Bee Development and Affects Transcriptional Responses of Newly Emerged Honey Bees,610,JOUR,"['Li, B.', 'Ke, L.', 'Li, A.-R.', 'Diao, Q.-Y.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Liu, Y.-J.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Understanding the cause of honey bee (Apis mellifera) population decline has attracted immense attention worldwide in recent years. Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the most probable factors due to the physiological and behavioral damage they cause to honey bees. However, the influence of thiacloprid, a relatively less toxic cyanogen-substituted form of neonicotinoid, on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) development is not well studied. The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that chronic sublethal thiacloprid can affect honey bee colonies by reducing survival and delaying bee development.

Despite many studies have revealed that honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae are posting a high risk on exposure to pesticides, but the toxicology information of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid on bee larvae remain limited. Results: The no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid for honey bee larvae were 4 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. Except for CarE, the enzymic activities of GST and P450 were not influenced by chlorothalonil at NOAEC, while chronic exposure to acetamiprid slightly increased the activities of the three tested enzymes at NOAEC. Further, the exposed larvae showed significantly higher expression of genes involved in a series of different toxicologically relevant process following, including caste development (Tor (GB44905), InR-2 (GB55425), Hr4 (GB47037), Ac3 (GB11637) and ILP-2 (GB10174)), immune system response (abaecin (GB18323), defensin-1 (GB19392), toll-X4 (GB50418)), and oxidative stress response (P450, GSH, GST, CarE). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the exposure to chlorothalonil and acetamiprid, even at concentrations below the NOAEC, showed potentially effects on bee larvae’s fitness, and more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect larvae fitness should be explored in the further.

Exposure of honey bee larvae to thiamethoxam and its interaction with Nosema ceranae infection in adult honey bees,731,JOUR,"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Zorc, M.', 'Ristanić, M.', 'Glavinić, U.', 'Stevanović, J.', 'Narat, M.', 'Stanimirović, Z.']",Environmental Pollution,"During their lifetime honey bees (Apis mellifera) rarely experience optimal conditions. Sometimes, a simultaneous action of multiple stressors, natural and chemical, results in even greater effect than of any stressor alone. Therefore, integrative investigations of different factors affecting honey bees have to be carried out. In this study, adult honey bees exposed to thiamethoxam in larval and/or adult stage and infected with Nosema ceranae were examined. Newly emerged bees from colonies, non-treated or treated with thiamethoxam, were organized in six groups and kept in cages. Thiamethoxam treated bees were further exposed to either thiamethoxam or Nosema (groups TT and TN), or simultaneously to both (group TTN). Newly emerged bees from non-treated colonies were exposed to Nosema (group CN). From both, treated and non-treated colonies two groups were organized and further fed only with sugar solution (groups C and TC). Here, we present the expression profile of 19 genes in adult worker honey bees comprising those involved in immune, detoxification, development and apoptosis response. Results showed that gene expression patterns changed with time and depended on the treatment. In group TC at the time of emergence the majority of tested genes were downregulated, among which nine were significantly altered. The same gene pattern was observed on day six, where the only significantly upregulated gene was defensin-1. On day nine most of analyzed genes in all experimental groups showed upregulation compared to control group, where upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes abaecin, defensin-1 and defensin-2 was significant in groups TT and TTN. On day 15 we observed a similar pattern of expression in groups TC and TT exposed to thiamethoxam only, where most of the detoxification genes were downregulated.

Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony.

Poorly known is the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple pesticides, which has high likelihood in agricultural landscapes. Four experiments were conducted to determine if simultaneous exposure to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide Assail®(30% acetamiprid) and the fungicide Orbit®or Tilt®(41.8% propiconazole) would cause detrimental effects on survival and colony productivity of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Survival of workers exposed to propiconazole was marginally reduced (Experiment 1), whereas gyne production increased in colonies exposed to acetamiprid (Experiment 2). There was a trend for fewer larvae and workers in colonies exposed to acetamiprid and a mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 3). Higher wax moth infestations and densities were observed in colonies exposed to the mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 4). In conclusion, exposure to the two pesticides resulted in variable outcomes in B. impatiens. Synergy between acetamiprid and propiconazole was explained as an indirect effect of enhanced wax worm infestation. We found an increased level of wax worm infestation in colonies exposed to a mixture of Assail and Tilt compared to colonies not exposed to Assail or Tilt (control) or exposed only to Assail. While this study does not provide evidence that B. impatiens are at high risk when simultaneously exposed to field rates of these two pesticides, we suggest that wild blueberry growers practice integrated pest management as a means of reducing any amount of risk to these important bumble bees. © 2020 South Carolina Entomological Society.

However, most research has focused on honeybees, leaving a significant gap in studies concerning native species, particularly regarding the impacts of pesticide combinations on these pollinators. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the sublethal effects of imidacloprid (IMD), pyraclostrobin (PYR), and glyphosate (GLY) on the behavior and fat body cell morphology and physiology of M. scutellaris . Foragers were orally exposed to the different pesticides alone and in combination for 48 h. Bees fed with contaminated solution walked less, moved slower, presented morphological changes in the fat body, including vacuolization, altered cell shape and nuclei morphology, and exhibited a higher count of altered oenocytes and trophocytes. In all exposed groups, alone and in combination, the number of cells expressing caspase-3 increased, but the TLR4 number of cells expressing decreased compared to the control groups. The intensity of HSP70 immunolabeling increased compared to the control groups. However, the intensity of the immunolabeling of HSP90 decreased in the IMD, GLY, and I + G (IMD + GLY) groups but increased in I +P -exposed bees (IMD + PYR). Alternatively, exposure to PYR and P + G (PYR + GLY) did not affect the immunolabeling intensity.

Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system.

Imidacloprid is a widely used neonicotinoid; thus, we have highlighted the importance of assessing its oral toxicity to Africanized bees and used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the sublethal effects in the brain, the target organ, and the midgut, responsible for the digestion/absorption of food. In addition, the distribution of proteins involved in important biological processes in the brain were evaluated on the 1st day of exposure by MALDI-imaging analysis. Bioassays were performed to determine the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid to bees, and the value obtained was 1.4651 ng imidacloprid/mu L diet. Based on this result, the sublethal concentration to be administered at 1, 4 and 8 days was established as a hundredth (1/100) of the LC50. The results obtained from the ultrastructural analysis showed alterations in the midgut cells of bees as nuclear and mitochondrial damage and an increase of vacuoles. The insecticide caused spacing among the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies, chromatin condensation and loss of mitochondrial cristae. The MALDI-imaging analysis showed an increase in the expression of such proteins as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, amyloid protein precursor and protein kinase C, which are related to oxygen supply, neuronal degeneration and memory/learning, and a decrease in the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 1, which is fundamental to the synapses. These alterations demonstrated that imidacloprid could compromise the viability of the midgut epithelium, as well as inhibiting important cognitive processes in individuals, and may be reflected in losses of the colony.",2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1874-4,27,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,
Exposure to acetamiprid influences the development and survival ability of worker bees (Apis mellifera L.) from larvae to adults,697,JOUR,"['Shi, J.', 'Zhang, R.', 'Pei, Y.', 'Liao, C.', 'Wu, X.']",Environmental Pollution,"In most cases, honey bees experience pesticide pollution in a long-term period through direct or indirect exposure, such as the development process from larvae to the pre-harvest stage. At present, little is known about how honey bees respond to pesticide stresses during the continuous development period. This study aims to examine effects of long-term acetamiprid exposure on the development and survival of honey bees, and further present the expression profile in larvae, 1-day-old, and 7-day-old adult worker bees that related to immune, detoxification, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and memory. Honey bees from 2-day-old larvae to 14-day-old adults except the pupal stage were continuously fed with different acetamiprid solutions (0, 5, and 25 mg/L). We found that acetamiprid over 5 mg/L disturbed the development involving birth weight and emergence rate of newly emerged bees, and reduced the proportion of capped cells of larvae at 25 mg/L; gene expression related to immune and detoxification of worker bees exposed to acetamiprid was roughly activated, returned and then inhibited from larval to emerged and to the late adult stage, respectively. Moreover, lifespans of bees treated with acetamiprid at 25 mg/L were significantly reduced.

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola has no long-term impact on honey bees,1004,JOUR,"['Cutler, G.C.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"We conducted a long-term investigation to ascertain effects on honey bee, Apis mellifera L., colonies during and after exposure to flowering canola, Brassica napus variety Hyola 420, grown from clothianidin-treated seed. Colonies were placed in the middle of 1-ha clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields for 3 wk during bloom, and thereafter they were moved to a fall apiary. There were four treated and four control fields, and four colonies per field, giving 32 colonies total, Bee mortality, worker longevity, and brood development were regularly assessed in each colony for 130 d from initial exposure to canola. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected for 130 d, and the samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues by using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Overall, no differences in bee mortality, worker longevity, or brood development occurred between control and treatment groups throughout the study. Weight gains of and honey yields from colonies in treated fields were not significantly different from those in control fields. Although clothianidin residues were detected in honey, nectar, and pollen from colonies in clothianidin-treated fields, maximum concentrations detected were 8- to 22-fold below the reported no observable adverse effects concentration. Clothianidin residues were not detected in any beeswax sample. Assessment of overwintered colonies in spring found no differences in those originally exposed to treated or control canola.

Exposure to field-realistic concentrations of imidacloprid at different ambient temperatures disrupts non-flight metabolic rate in honey bee (Apis mellifera) foragers,728,JOUR,"['Gooley, Z.C.', 'Gooley, A.C.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"Pollinators facilitate the reproduction of the majority of the world’s plants but some of the most economically important pol linat-ing insects (Hymenoptera Apoidea) have undergone declines, possibly due to neonicotinoid agricultural pesticides. Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids can affect insects’ behavioral and physiological performance, and the detoxification of these pesticides likely affects insects’ metabolism. We measured honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) foragers’ CO2 production rates at different temperatures (25, 30, or 35 °C) after they consumed syrup dosed with a field realistic (5 µg/L) or high (20 µg/L) concentration of a neon-icotinoid insecticide (i.e. imidacloprid) for 48 hours. We found that imidacloprid exposure significantly disrupted honey bees’ non-flight metabolic rates and there was a significant interaction between imidacloprid dosage and ambient temperature. Honey bee foragers dosed with 5 µg/L imidacloprid displayed higher average metabolic rates and those dosed with 20 µg/L imidacloprid displayed similar average metabolic rates compared to the corresponding control group across all temperatures. Exposure to fi eld realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid may have a higher energetic cost for honey bees at 25 °C than at higher ambient tempera-tures. Disrupted energy costs in honey bees fed imidacloprid might be due to the thermoregulation, nerve excitation, or detoxification processes. Metabolic rate changes caused by pesticide exposure could result in less available energy for honey bees to per-form hive duties and forage, which could negatively affect colony health. © 2020, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees,961,JOUR,"['Williamson, S.M.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes. © 2013.

Several studies show that neonicotinoids affect navigation and learning in bees but few studies have examined whether these substances influence their basic motor function. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to sublethal doses of four neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, dinotefuran) and the plant toxin, nicotine, affect basic motor function and postural control in foraging-age worker honeybees. We used doses of 10 nM for each neonicotinoid: field-relevant doses that we determined to be sublethal and willingly consumed by bees. The neonicotinoids were placed in food solutions given to bees for 24 h. After the exposure period, bees were more likely to lose postural control during the motor function assay and fail to right themselves if exposed to imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin. Bees exposed to thiamethoxam and nicotine also spent more time grooming. Other behaviours (walking, sitting and flying) were not significantly affected. Expression of changes in motor function after exposure to imidacloprid was dose-dependent and affected all measured behaviours. Our data illustrate that 24 h exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoid pesticides has a subtle influence on bee behaviour that is likely to affect normal function in a field setting. © 2014, The Author(s).",2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1283-x,23,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

We have tested (1) the interference of the pesticide flupyradifurone on male precopulatory behavior and male mating partner preferences, (2) the way that the pesticide interferes in male quality assessment by the female, and (3) the effects of the pesticide on the chemical compounds in the female cuticle. We exposed bees of both sexes to a sublethal concentration of flupyradifurone. Various behaviors were registered in a mating arena with two females (one unexposed and one exposed) and one male (either unexposed or exposed). Unexposed males were quicker to attempt to mate. Treatment also impacted precopulatory behavior and male quality assessment by females. Males approached unexposed females more quickly than insecticide-exposed ones. Females exposed to insecticide produced lower amounts of some cuticular hydrocarbons (sex pheromone candidates) and appeared less choosy than unexposed females. Our findings suggest that insecticide exposure affects sexual communication, playing a role both in male preference and in male quality assessment by the female. © 2023 The Authors.

Considering the ecological and economic relevance of native bees, such as Scaptotrigona postica, and the insufficient studies on the effects of pesticides on their behavior and physiology, improving the current knowledge on this issue is essential. Therefore, this study investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, and glyphosate on the behavior and fat body cells of S. postica. Pesticide ingestion decreased the walking distance and mean velocity of bees compared to the control and solvent control groups. The oenocytes of the control groups were spherical, with central nuclei containing decondensed chromatin, and the trophocytes presented irregular morphology, with cells varying in shape and the cytoplasm filled with vacuoles and granules. However, bees exposed to pesticides showed extensive cytoarchitectural disruption in the fat body, such as vacuolization and shape changes in oenocytes and altered nuclei morphology in trophocytes. Moreover, pesticide exposure increased the number of atypical oenocytes and altered trophocytes, except for the PYR group, which showed a lower number of atypical oenocytes. Caspase-positive labeling significantly increased in all exposed bee groups. Alternatively, TLR4 labeling was significantly decreased in the exposed groups compared to the control groups. There was a significant increase in HSP90 immunolabeling in all exposed groups compared to the control. These findings reinforce the importance of research on the sublethal effects of low pesticide concentrations on key neotropical pollinators and prove that these toxic substances can impair their detoxification and immune defense. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168072,907,,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,
Exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid insecticide modulated the expression of microRNAs in honeybees (Apis mellifera L.),105,JOUR,"['Shi, T.', 'Jiang, X.', 'Cao, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"This study aimed to investigate the sublethal effects of thiacloprid on microRNA (miRNA) expression in honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) and the role of a specific miRNA, ame-miR-283–5p, in thiacloprid resistance. The high-throughput small RNA-sequencing was used to analyze global miRNA expression profile changes in honeybees orally exposed to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid (20 mg/L and 4 mg/L) for 72 h. Thiacloprid at 20 mg/L had no observed adverse effects. In addition, bees were fed with miRNA mimics or inhibitors to increase or decrease ame-miR-283–5p expression, and its effects on P450 gene expression (CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3) were examined. Thiacloprid susceptibility was also detected. The results showed that treatment with thiacloprid at 20 mg/L and 4 mg/L induced 11 and five differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the DEMs are mainly involved in the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, nerve conduction, and behavior. ame-miR-283–5p was downregulated by both concentrations, which was validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis. Enhancing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly inhibited CYP9Q2 mRNA and protein expression, and increased thiacloprid toxicity, while reducing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly promoted CYP9Q2 expression, and decreased thiacloprid susceptibility.

For the most part, exposure to these pesticide mixtures does not result in acute lethal effects, but we know very little about potential sublethal effects and their consequences on reproductive success and population dynamics. In this study, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia cornuta to environmentally-relevant levels of acetamiprid (a cyano-substituted neonicotinoid insecticide) singly and in combination with tebuconazole (a sterol-biosynthesis inhibitor (SBI) fungicide). The amount of feeding solution consumed during the exposure phase was lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Following exposure, females were individually marked and released into oilseed rape field cages to monitor their nesting performance and assess their reproductive success. The nesting performance and reproductive success of bees exposed to the fungicide or the insecticide alone were similar to those of control bees and resulted in a 1.3–1.7 net population increases. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed lower establishment, shortened nesting period, and reduced fecundity. Together, these effects led to a 0.5–0.6 population decrease. Female establishment and shortened nesting period were the main population bottlenecks. We found no effects of the pesticide mixture on nest provisioning rate, offspring body weight or sex ratio. Our study shows how sublethal pesticide exposure may affect several components of bee reproductive success and, ultimately, population growth.

"Exposure to the novel insecticide flupyradifurone impairs bumblebee feeding motivation, learning, and memory retention",317,JOUR,"['Siviter, H', 'Muth, F']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Bees are vital pollinators of crops and wildflowers and as such, wild bee declines threaten food security and functioning ecosystems. One driver of bee declines is the use of systemic insecticides, such as commonly used neonicotinoids. However, rising pest resistance to neonicotinoids, and restrictions on their use in the EU, has increased the demand for replacement insecticides to control crop pests. Flupyradifurone is a novel systemic insecticide that is thought to be relatively 'bee safe' although it can be present in the nectar and pollen of bee-attractive crops. Bumblebees rely on learning to forage efficiently, and thus detriments to learning performance may have downstream consequences on their ability to forage. While neonicotinoids negatively influence bumblebee learning and memory, whether this is also the case for their replacements is unclear. Here, we exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of flupyradifurone before training them to learn either an olfactory or colour association. We found that flupyradifurone impaired bumblebees' learning and memory performance in both olfactory and visual modalities. Flupyradifurone-treated bees were also less motivated to feed. Given the similarity between the detriments to cognition found here and those previously reported for neonicotinoids, this implies that these insecticides may have similar sub-lethal effects on bees. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use are therefore unlikely to benefit bees if novel insecticides like flupyradifurone are used as an alternative, highlighting that current agrochemical risk assessments are not protecting bees from the unwanted consequences of pesticide use. Sub-lethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory in agrochemical regulation to ensure that novel insecticides are indeed 'bee safe'.",2022,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119575,307,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

TMX and other neonicotinoids are reported to be potential causes of honey bee decline. Due to its systematic action, TMX may be recovered in pollen, bee bread, nectar, and honey, which make bees likely to be exposed to contaminated diet. In this study, we used immunolabeling to demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of TMX decrease the protein levels of synapsin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the antennal lobes (ALs) of pupae and newly emerged worker bees that were exposed through the food to TMX during the larval phase. A decrease in the synapsin level was observed in the MBs of pupae previously exposed to 0.001 and 1.44 ng/µL and in newly emerged bees previously exposed to 1.44 ng/µL and no changes were observed in the optical lobes (OLs). In the ALs, the decrease was observed in pupae and newly emerged bees exposed to 1.44 ng/µL. Because the MBs and ALs are brain structures involved in stimuli reception, learning, and memory consolidation and because synapsin is important for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we hypothesize that exposure to sublethal concentrations of TMX during the larval stage may cause neurophysiological disorders in honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.048,169,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

First published July 6, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00126.2011.-Acetylcholine (ACh) is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the insect brain, where nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast cholinergic synaptic transmission. In the honeybee Apis mellifera, nAChRs are expressed in diverse structures including the primary olfactory centers of the brain, the antennal lobes (ALs) and the mushroom bodies (MBs), where they participate in olfactory information processing. To understand the nature and properties of the nAChRs involved in these processes, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of nAChRs on cultured Kenyon cells of the MBs, using whole cell patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR. In all cells, applications of ACh as well as nicotinic agonists such as nicotine and imidacloprid induced inward currents with fast desensitization. These currents were fully blocked by saturating doses of the antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT), dihydroxy-beta-erythroidine (DHE), and methyllycaconitine (MLA) (MLA >= alpha-BGT >= DHE). Molecular analysis of ACh-responding cells revealed that of the 11 nicotinic receptor subunits encoded within the honeybee genome, alpha 2, alpha 8, and beta 1 subunits were expressed in adult Kenyon cells. Comparison with the expression pattern of adult AL cells revealed the supplementary presence of subunit alpha 7, which could be responsible for the kinetic and pharmacological differences observed when comparing ACh-induced currents from AL and Kenyon cells. Together, our data demonstrate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult MB Kenyon cells that differ from nAChRs on AL cells in both their molecular composition and pharmacological properties, suggesting that changing receptor subsets could mediate different processing functions depending on the brain structure within the olfactory pathway.",2011,10.1152/jn.00126.2011,106,,0,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

Clothianidin and dimethoate exhibited more rapid toxicokinetics with 48 to 720 hour LC50s changes of <4 fold.

Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (γ-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-Transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-Treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-Treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a.i.) may induce substantial bee mortality. Rotating with other insecticides is a necessary and practical way to reduce the residue level of any given pesticide.",2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0178421,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Field realistic doses of pesticide imidacloprid reduce bumblebee pollen foraging efficiency,71,JOUR,"['Feltham, H', 'Park, K', 'Goulson, D']",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Bumblebees and other pollinators provide a vital ecosystem service for the agricultural sector. Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.",2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1189-7,23,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
"Field relevance of a synergistic effect observed in the laboratory between an EBI fungicide and a chloronicotinyl insecticide in the honeybee (Apis mellifera L, Hymenoptera)",162,JOUR,"['Schmuck, R', 'Stadler, T', 'Schmidt, HW']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"It had been found earlier that the chloronicotinyl insecticide thiacloprid (as the 480 g litre(-1) SC Calypso(R)) poses a favourably low toxicity hazard to the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. As with pyrethroids, the metabolization of chloronicotinyl compounds involves monooxygenases, which are known to be inhibited by some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides potentially co-applied with these insecticides. The potential synergistic enhancement of the toxicity of thiacloprid to honeybees when co-applied with such fungicides was therefore studied under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Fungicides of other chemical classes were also examined for synergistic potential to reveal other metabolic interactions. In the laboratory, only a slight synergistic effect was observed with the anilinopyrimidine fungicide examined, while a significant enhancement of thiacloprid toxicity to honeybees was found with EBI fungicides. In three tunnel tests conducted under different environmental conditions to simulate field exposure, no increased mortality was observed when honeybees were directly sprayed with thiacloprid (Calypso) alone or in combination with the EBI fungicide tebuconazole (250 g litre(-1) EW, Folicur(R)). There was also no synergized reduction in the foraging intensity on the treated crop. In general, the foraging intensity decreased after thiacloprid treatment but was restored within 24-48 h. The hive vitality was not affected by either thiacloprid or its tank mix with tebuconazole. Our results suggest that, at the recommended use rates, thiacloprid poses a negligible lethal risk to honeybees when applied either alone or in tank mixes with fungicides of various chemical classes.

To establish whether such synergisms reduce bee performance in real-world agricultural landscapes, we analysed the microbial composition of the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) samples from our recent landscape study on the impacts of field-level clothianidin exposure. We related clothianidin exposure and microbial composition to both individual- and colony-level performance parameters, to better understand the direct and indirect mechanistic effects of neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees. We show that exposure to clothianidin from seed-coated oilseed rape reduces bumblebee size and numbers, particularly of reproductives. However, exposure does not affect the levels of non-pathogenic bacteria or viruses, nor induce rises in the levels or virulence of intracellular parasites. We conclude that field exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin affects bumblebee performance but generally not their pathogenic or beneficial microbiota. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,10.1038/s41467-018-07914-3,9,,0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,
Field-realistic concentrations of a neonicotinoid insecticide influence socially regulated brood development in a bumblebee,368,JOUR,"['Chole, H', 'de Guinea, M', 'Woodard, SH', 'Bloch, G']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"The systemic neonicotinoid insecticides are considered as one of the key culprits contributing to ongoing declines in pollinator health and abundance. Bumblebees are among the most important pollinators of temperate zone plants, making their susceptibility to neonicotinoid exposure of great concern. We report that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies exposed to field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid Imidacloprid grew slower, consumed less food, and produced fewer workers, males and gynes, but unexpectedly produced larger workers compared to control colonies. Behavioural observations show that queens in pesticide-treated colonies spend more time inactive and less time caring for the brood. We suggest that the observed effects on brood body size are driven by a decreased queen ability to manipulate the larva developmental programme. These findings reveal an intricate and previously unknown effect of insecticides on the social interactions controlling brood development in social insect colonies. Insecticide influences on the social mechanisms regulating larval development are potentially detrimental for bumblebees, in which body size strongly influences both caste differentiation and the division of labour among workers, two organization principles of insect societies.",2022,10.1098/rspb.2022.0253,289,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Field-realistic exposure to the novel insecticide flupyradifurone reduces reproductive output in a bumblebee (Bombus impatiens),360,JOUR,"['Richardson, LI', 'Siviter, H', 'Jha, S', 'Muth, F']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Novel insecticides are continuously being developed for application in response to increased legal restriction of previously developed insecticides and resistance in target insects. These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality. Despite this fact, sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproduction, are not mandatorily assessed within the regulatory process. Our findings highlight the importance of determining sub-lethal effects of pesticides across developmental stages, as well as using pollinator species other than honeybees within the regulatory process.",2024,10.1111/1365-2664.14706,61,,0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,
First insights into the honey bee (Apis mellifera) brain lipidome and its neonicotinoid-induced alterations associated with reduced self-grooming behavior,12,JOUR,"['Morfin, N.', 'Fillier, T.A.', 'Pham, T.H.', 'Goodwin, P.H.', 'Thomas, R.H.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",Journal of Advanced Research,"Introduction: Honey bees (Apis mellifera) play key roles in food production performing complex behaviors, like self-grooming to remove parasites. However, the lipids of their central nervous system have not been examined, even though they likely play a crucial role in the performance of cognitive process to perform intricate behaviors. Lipidomics has greatly advanced our understanding of neuropathologies in mammals and could provide the same for honey bees. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the brain lipidome of adult honey bees and to assess the effect of clothianidin (a neurotoxic insecticide) on the brain lipid composition, gene expression, and performance of self-grooming behavior under controlled conditions (cage experiments). Methods: After seven days of exposure to oral sublethal doses of clothianidin, the bees were assessed for self-grooming behavior; their brains were dissected to analyze the lipidome using an untargeted lipidomics approach and to perform a high throughput RNAseq analysis. Results: Compared to all other organisms, healthy bee brain lipidomes contain unusually high levels of alkyl-ether linked (plasmanyl) phospholipids (51.42%) and low levels of plasmalogens (plasmenyl phospholipids; 3.46%). This could make it more susceptible to the effects of toxins in the environment. A positive correlation between CL 18:3/18:1/14:0/22:6, TG 6:0/11:2/18:1, LPE 18:0e and intense self-grooming was found. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid altered PC 20:3e/15:0, PC 16:0/18:3, PA 18:0/24:1, and TG 18:1/18:1/18/1 levels, and affected gene expression linked to GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and energy metabolism that may be partially responsible for the altered lipid composition. Conclusion: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral disorders. © 2022",2022,10.1016/j.jare.2021.08.007,37,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Flupyradifurone reduces nectar consumption and foraging but does not alter honey bee recruitment dancing,251,JOUR,"Wu, Y.-Y.; Pasberg, P.; Diao, Q.-Y.; Nieh, J.C.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Foraging is essential for honey bee colony fitness and is enhanced by the waggle dance, a recruitment behavior in which bees can communicate food location and quality. We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Food consumption and food exchange of caged honey bees using a radioactive labelled sugar solution,860,JOUR,"['Brodschneider, R.', 'Libor, A.', 'Kupelwieser, V.', 'Crailsheim, K.']",PLoS ONE,"We measured the distribution of sugar solution within groups of caged honey bees (Apis mellifera) under standard in vitro laboratory conditions using 14C polyethylene glycol as a radioactive marker to analyze ingestion by individual bees after group feeding. We studied the impact of different experimental setups by varying the number of bees, age of bees, origin of bees, duration of experiment, the amount of available diet, and the influence of the neurotoxic pesticide imidacloprid in the diet on the feeding and food sharing behavior (trophallaxis). Sugar solution was non-uniformly distributed in bees in 36 out of 135 cages. As a measure of the extent to which the sugar diet was equally distributed between caged bees, we calculated the (inner 80%) intake ratio by dividing the intake of the 90th percentile bee by the intake of the 10th percentile bee. This intake ratio ranged from 1.3 to 94.8 in 133 individual cages, further supporting a non-uniform distribution of food among caged bees. We can expect a cage with 10 or 30 bees containing one bee that ingests, on average, the 8.8-fold of the bee in the same cage ingesting the smallest quantity of food. Inner 80% intake ratios were lower in experiments with a permanent or chronic offering of labelled sugar solution compared to temporary or acute feedings. After pooling the data of replicates to achieve a higher statistical power we compared different experimental setups. We found that uniform food distribution is best approached with 10 newly emerged bees per cage, which originate from a brood comb from a single colony. We also investigated the trophallaxis between caged honey bees which originally consumed the diet and newly added bees. Color marked bees were starved and added to the cages in a ratio of 10:5 or 20:20 after the initial set of bees consumed all the labelled sugar solution. The distribution of the labelled sugar solution by trophallaxis within 48 hours to added bees was 25% (10:5) or 45% (20:20) of the initial sugar solution. Imidacloprid at its median lethal dose (LD50) in the sugar solution reduced this post-feeding food transmission to 27% (20:20). Our results show that differences in food intake exist within caged bees that may lead to differential exposure that can influence the interpretation of toxicity tests. © 2017 Brodschneider et al.

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

Foraging bumblebees acquire a preference for neonicotinoid-treated food with prolonged exposure,228,JOUR,"['Arce, AN', 'Rodrigues, AR', 'Yu, JJ', 'Colgan, TJ', 'Wurm, Y', 'Gill, RJ']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Social bees represent an important group of pollinating insects that can be exposed to potentially harmful pesticides when foraging on treated or contaminated flowering plants. To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape.",2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0655,285,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

Pesticides enter the hive through contaminated nectar and pollen carried by returning forager honey bees or placed in the hive by beekeepers when managing hive pests. We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss.

Functional orthologs of honeybee CYP6AQ1 in stingless bees degrade the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone,1,JOUR,"['Xiao, XZ', 'Haas, J', 'Nauen, R']",ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"Flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel butenolide insecticide binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), has been shown to be less acutely toxic to western honey bees (Apis mellifera) than other insecticides such as neonicotinoids sharing the same target-site. A previous study revealed that this is due to enhanced oxidative metabolism of FPF, mediated by three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), including CYP6AQ1. Therefore, we followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in FPF metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis on four stingless bee species, including Frieseomelitta varia, Heterotrigona itama, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonula carbonaria to identify CYP6AQ1-like functional orthologs. Three non-Meliponini, but tropical bee species, i.e., Ammobates syriacus, Euglossa dilemma and Megalopta genalis were analyzed as well. We identified candidate P450s in all (neo)tropical species with greater than 61% and 67% predicted protein sequence identities when compared to A. mellifera CYP6AQ1 and Bombus terrestris CYP6AQ26, respectively. Heterologous expression in High Five insect cells of these functional orthologs revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a preference for the O-debenzylation of bulkier substrates. Competition assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BOMFC) with these enzymes indicated inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by increasing concentrations of FPF. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/ MS analysis revealed the capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolize FPF by hydroxylation in vitro at various levels, indicating a conserved FPF detoxification potential in different (neo)tropical bee species including Meliponini. This research, employing a toxicogenomics approach, provides important insights into the potential of stingless and other tropical bee species to detoxify FPF, and highlights the significance of investigating the detoxification mechanisms of insecticides in non-Apis bee species by molecular tools to inform risk assessment and conservation efforts.",2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115719,268,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system.

Fungivorous mites enhance the survivorship and development of stingless bees even when exposed to pesticides,91,JOUR,"['Rosa-Fontana, AS', 'Dorigo, AS', 'Malaquias, JB', 'Pachú, JKS', 'Nocelli, RCF', 'Tosi, S', 'Malaspina, O']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Stingless bees are the largest group of eusocial bees in the world. They play an essential role as crop pollinators and have been considered for inclusion in pesticide risk assessments (RAs). Beyond the mutualism involving stingless bee larvae and fungi, the fungivorous mite Proctotydaeus (Neotydeolus) alvearii proved to be interesting for studies of associations with stingless bees. Their presence is related to colony strength and health, showing a permanent-host-association level. Here, we tested whether the coexistence with P. (N.) alvearii affects stingless bee larvae survivorship and development, including when fed pesticide-dosed food. We chose dimethoate, the reference standard for toxicity tests, and thiamethoxam, widely used in neotropical crops and listed to be reassessed in RAs. Bees associated with the mites showed higher larval survivorship rates, even in the dosed ones, and revealed changes in the developmental time and body size. Our study represents the first approach to stingless bee responses to the coexistence of fungivorous mites inside brood cells, leading us to believe that these mites play a beneficial role in stingless bees, including when they are exposed to pesticides.",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-25482-x,12,,0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Gene expression changes in honey bees induced by sublethal imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage,850,JOUR,"['Wu, M.-C.', 'Chang, Y.-W.', 'Lu, K.-H.', 'Yang, E.-C.']",Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"Honey bee larvae exposed to sublethal doses of imidacloprid show behavioural abnormalities as adult insects. Previous studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon originates from abnormal neural development in response to imidacloprid exposure. Here, we further investigated the global gene expression changes in the heads of newly emerged adults and observed that 578 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in gene expression after imidacloprid exposure. This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated. These downregulation patterns were further confirmed through analyses using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the heads of 6-day-old nurse bees.

Gene expression in bumble bee larvae differs qualitatively between high and low concentration imidacloprid exposure levels,456,JOUR,"['Martín-Blázquez, R.', 'Calhoun, A.C.', 'Sadd, B.M.', 'Cameron, S.A.']",Scientific Reports,"Neonicotinoid pesticides negatively impact bumble bee health, even at sublethal concentrations. Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0 ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects. We found 678 genes differentially expressed under both imidacloprid exposures relative to controls, including mitochondrial activity, development, and DNA replication genes. However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure; uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results. A smaller differentially expressed set only in lower concentration larvae, included neural development and cell growth genes.

Total RNA was extracted from individual larvae and first strand cDNAs were generated. Gene-expression changes in larvae were measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting transcripts for pathogens and genes involved in physiological processes, bee health, immunity, and/or xenobiotic detoxification. Transcript levels for Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein (PGRPSC), a pathogen recognition gene, increased in larvae exposed to Varroa mites (P<0.001) and were not changed in pesticide treated larvae. As expected, Varroa-parasitized brood had higher transcripts of Deformed Wing Virus than did control larvae (P<0.001). Varroa parasitism, arguably coupled with virus infection, resulted in significantly higher transcript abundances for the antimicrobial peptides abaecin, hymenoptaecin, and defensin1. Transcript levels for Prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPOact), an immune end product, were elevated in larvae treated with myclobutanil and chlorothalonil (both are fungicides) (P<0.001). Transcript levels for Hexameric storage protein (Hsp70) were significantly upregulated in imidacloprid, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, and amitraz treated larvae.

General and species-specific impacts of a neonicotinoid insecticide on the ovary development and feeding of wild bumblebee queens,311,JOUR,"['Baron, GL', 'Raine, NE', 'Brown, MJF']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Bumblebees are essential pollinators of crops and wild plants, but are in decline across the globe. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment testing the impacts of field relevant doses (1.87-5.32 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species, suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all four species. In addition to providing the first evidence for general effects of neonicotinoids on ovary development in multiple species of wild bumblebee queens, the discovery of species-specific effects on feeding has significant implications for current practices and policy for pesticide risk assessment and use.",2017,10.1098/rspb.2017.0123,284,0.0,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

We carried out experiments to study the genetic and molecular basis of NNI tolerance in honeybees, which may underlie the dis-crepancies observed in the literature. We discovered that worker survival post -exposure to an acute oral dose of clothianidin is heritable (H2 = 37.8%). Tolerance to clothianidin was not associated with differences in the expression of detoxifica-tion enzymes in our experiments. Instead, mutations in the primary neonicotinoid detoxification genes CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q3 were strongly associated with worker survival post-clothianidin exposure. In some instances, the strong association between CYP9Q haplotypes and worker survival was associated with the pro-tein's predicted binding affinity for clothianidin.

While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (<1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled significantly increased. These results demonstrate the variation arising from the genetic background and physiological transitions in honey bees as they age. This information can be used to determine risk assessment, as well as establishing baseline data for future comparisons to explain the variation in toxicity differences for honey bees reported in the literature.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0139841,10,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,
"Genomic architecture and sexually dimorphic expression underlying immunity in the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis",538,JOUR,"['Möllmann, J.S.', 'Colgan, T.J.']",Insect Molecular Biology,"Insect pollinators provide crucial ecosystem services yet face increasing environmental pressures. The challenges posed by novel and reemerging pathogens on bee health means we need to improve our understanding of the immune system, an important barrier to infections and disease. Despite the importance of solitary bees, which are ecologically relevant, our understanding of the genomic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying their immune potential, and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence it is limited. To improve our understanding of the genomic architecture underlying immunity of a key solitary bee pollinator, we characterized putative immune genes of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis. In addition, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets to determine how sexes differ in immune gene expression and splicing but also how pesticide exposure may affect immune gene expression in females. Through comparative genomics, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of more than 500 putative immune-related genes. We found genome-wide patterns of sex-biased gene expression, with greater enrichment of immune-related processes among genes with higher constitutive expression in males than females. Our results also suggest an up-regulation of immune-related genes in response to exposure to two common neonicotinoids, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the gene repertoire, regulation and expression differences in the sexes of O. bicornis, as well as providing additional support for how neonicotinoids can affect immune gene expression, which may affect the capacity of solitary bees to respond to pathogenic threats. © 2022 The Authors.

For example, recent work has shown that cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this, exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration. Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. © 2019 Beadle et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2019,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007903,15,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3′(2′), 5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq.

Gut microbiota composition and gene expression changes induced in the Apis cerana exposed to acetamiprid and difenoconazole at environmentally realistic concentrations alone or combined,537,JOUR,"['Han, W.', 'Ye, Z.', 'Gu, Y.', 'Zhong, Y.', 'Gao, J.', 'Zhao, S.', 'Wang, S.']",Frontiers in Physiology,"Apis cerana is an important pollinator of agricultural crops in China. In the agricultural environment, A. cerana may be exposed to acetamiprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) and difenoconazole (triazole fungicide), alone or in combination because they are commonly applied to various crops. At present, our understanding of the toxicological effects of acetamiprid and difenoconazole on honey bee gut microbiomes is limited. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether these two pesticides affect honey bees’ gut microbiota and to analyze the transcriptional effects of these two pesticides on honey bees’ head and gut. In this study, adults of A. cerana were exposed to acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole by contaminated syrup at field-realistic concentrations for 10 days. Results indicated that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole chronic exposure did not affect honey bees’ survival and food consumption, whereas difenoconazole decreased the weight of honey bees. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that difenoconazole and the mixture of difenoconazole and acetamiprid decreased the diversity index and shaped the composition of gut bacteria microbiota, whereas acetamiprid did not impact the gut bacterial community. The ITS sequence data showed that neither of the two pesticides affected the fungal community structure. Meanwhile, we also observed that acetamiprid or difenoconazole significantly altered the expression of genes related to detoxification and immunity in honey bees’ tissues. Furthermore, we observed that the adverse effect of the acetamiprid and difenoconazole mixture on honey bees’ health was greater than that of a single mixture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole exposure at field-realistic concentrations induced changes to the honey bee gut microbiome and gene expression.

As honeybee colonies can be frequently exposed to bio-aggressors in real conditions, often concomitantly with pesticides, co-exposure to pesticidei/bio-aggressors is becoming a concern for regulatory authorities. We investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the homing performances of foragers emerging from colonies differentiated by health status (infestation with Varroa destructor mites, microsporidian parasite Nosema spp. and Deformed Wing Virus). We designed a homing test that has been recently identified to fill a regulatory gap in the field evaluations of sublethal doses of pesticides before their registration. We also assessed the effect of temperature as an environmental factor. Our results showed that the Varroa mite exacerbates homing failure (HF) caused by the insecticide, whereas high temperatures reduce insecticide-induced HF. Through an analytical Effective Dose (ED) approach, predictive modeling results showed that, for instance, ED level of an uninfested colony, can be divided by 3.3 when the colony is infested by 5 Varroa mites per 100 bees and at a temperature of 24 degrees C.

The hypothesis raised was whether imidacloprid could migrate into nectar and pollen, then modify Rower attractiveness, homing behavior, and colony development. Our greenhouse and field experiments with Bombus terrestris L. were aimed at the following: the behavior of workers foraging on treated and control plants blooming in a greenhouse, the homing rate of colonies placed for 9 d in a treated field compared with colonies in a control field, and the development of these 20 colonies under laboratory conditions when removed from the fields. In the greenhouse, workers visited blooming heads of treated and control plants at the same rate and the mean duration of their visits was similar. In field colonies, analysis of pollen in hairs and pellets of workers showed that in both fields 98% of nectar foragers visited exclusively sunflowers, whereas only 25% of pollen gatherers collected sunflower pollen. After 9 d, in the control and treated field, 23 and 33% of the marked foragers, respectively, did not return to hives. In both fields, workers significantly drifted from the center to the sides of colony rows. During the 26-d period under field and laboratory conditions, the population increase rate of the 20 colonies was 3.3 and 3.0 workers/ d in hives of the control and treated field, respectively. This difference was not significant. New queens were produced in eight colonies in either field. The mean number of new queens per hive was 17 and 24 in the control and treated field, respectively.

We found a significant reduced capping rate in treated maize compared to flowering strips and Phacelia, but no interaction effect between pesticide treatment and nutritional status on capping rate. The response to treatment on the longevity of adults differed significantly between maize and Phacelia, with flower strips being intermediate, indicating interaction effects of PPP treatment and low pollen quality in maize compared to Phacelia and flowering strip treatments. Head weight of newly hatched worker bees showed significant interaction of nutritional status and treatment of PPPs. PPPs slightly increased body weight in all nutritional statuses, except for Phacelia. Enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase showed significant different responses between maize and Phacelia to PPP exposure, but not between maize and flowering strip.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases and are known to cause hyperacetylation of histone cores and influence gene expression. In our study, the HDACi sodium butyrate was applied to honeybees as a dietary supplement. The effect of sodium butyrate on the expression profiles of memory-related genes was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results revealed that this HDACi had up-regulation effects on most of the memory-related genes in bees, even in bees treated with imidacloprid. In addition, using the proboscis extension reflex to evaluate olfactory learning in bees, we found that this HDACi boosted the memory formation of bees after impairment owing to imidacloprid exposure. This study investigated the association between gene expression and memory formation from an epigenetic perspective. Additionally, we further demonstrate the possibility of enhancing bee learning using HDACis and provide initial data for future research.",2018,10.1111/imb.12390,27,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Decrease Foraging but Not Recruitment after Neonicotinoid Exposure,587,JOUR,"['Ohlinger, B.D.', 'Schürch, R.', 'Durzi, S.', 'Kietzman, P.M.', 'Silliman, M.R.', 'Couvillon, M.J.']",Journal of Insect Science,"Honey bees (Linnaeus, Hymenoptera: Apidae) are widely used as commercial pollinators and commonly forage in agricultural and urban landscapes containing neonicotinoid-treated plants. Previous research has demonstrated that honey bees display adverse behavioral and cognitive effects after treatment with sublethal doses of neonicotinoids. In laboratory studies, honey bees simultaneously increase their proportional intake of neonicotinoid-treated solutions and decrease their total solution consumption to some concentrations of certain neonicotinoids. These findings suggest that neonicotinoids might elicit a suboptimal response in honey bees, in which they forage preferentially on foods containing pesticides, effectively increasing their exposure, while also decreasing their total food intake; however, behavioral responses in semifield and field conditions are less understood. Here we conducted a feeder experiment with freely flying bees to determine the effects of a sublethal, field-realistic concentration of imidacloprid (IMD) on the foraging and recruitment behaviors of honey bees visiting either a control feeder containing a sucrose solution or a treatment feeder containing the same sucrose solution with IMD. We report that IMD-treated honey bees foraged less frequently (-28%) and persistently (-66%) than control foragers. Recruitment behaviors (dance frequency and dance propensity) also decreased with IMD, but nonsignificantly. Our results suggest that neonicotinoids inhibit honey bee foraging, which could potentially decrease food intake and adversely affect colony health. © 2022 The Author(s).

Abrasion of the seed coating generates insecticide-laden planter dust that disperses through the landscape during corn planting and has resulted in many “bee-kill” incidents in North America and Europe. We investigated the linkage between corn planting and honey bee colony success in a region dominated by corn agriculture. Over 3 yr we consistently observed an increased presence of corn seed treatment insecticides in bee-collected pollen and elevated worker bee mortality during corn planting. Residues of seed treatment neonicotinoids, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, detected in pollen positively correlated with cornfield area surrounding the apiaries. Elevated worker mortality was also observed in experimental colonies fed field-collected pollen containing known concentrations of corn seed treatment insecticides. We monitored colony growth throughout the subsequent year in 2015 and found that colonies exposed to higher insecticide concentrations exhibited slower population growth during the month of corn planting but demonstrated more rapid growth in the month following, though this difference may be related to forage availability. Exposure to seed treatment neonicotinoids during corn planting has clear short-term detrimental effects on honey bee colonies and may affect the viability of beekeeping operations that are dependent on maximizing colony size in the springtime.

Most studies have focused on three neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) currently subject to a moratorium in the EU. Here, we focus on thiacloprid, a widely used cyano-substituted neonicotinoid thought to be less toxic to honey bees and of which use has increased in the last years. Honey bees (Apis mellifera carnica) were exposed chronically to thiacloprid in the field for several weeks at a sublethal concentration. Foraging behavior, homing success, navigation performance, and social communication were impaired, and thiacloprid residue levels increased both in the foragers and the nest mates over time.

Honey bee (Apis mellifera) exposomes and dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with Nosema ceranae infection,1050,JOUR,"['Broadrup, RL', 'Mayack, C', 'Schick, SJ', 'Eppley, EJ', 'White, HK', 'Macherone, A']",PLOS ONE,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) health has been severely impacted by multiple environmental stressors including parasitic infection, pesticide exposure, and poor nutrition. The decline in bee health is therefore a complex multifactorial problem which requires a holistic investigative approach. Within the exposome paradigm, the combined exposure to the environment, drugs, food, and individuals' internal biochemistry affects health in positive and negative ways. In the context of the exposome, honey bee hive infection with parasites such as Nosema ceranae is also a form of environmental exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to xenobiotic pesticides and other environmental chemicals increases susceptibility to N. ceranae infection upon incidental exposure to the parasite. We further queried whether these exposures could be linked to changes in conserved metabolic biological pathways. From 30 hives sampled across 10 sites, a total of 2,352 chemical features were found via gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF) in extracts of honey bees collected from each hive. Of these, 20 pesticides were identified and annotated, and found to be significantly associated with N. ceranae infection. We further determined that infected hives were linked to a greater number of xenobiotic exposures, and the relative concentration of the exposures were not linked to the presence of a N. ceranae infection. In the exposome profiles of the bees, we also found chemicals inherent to known biological metabolic pathways of Apis mellifera and identified 9 dysregulated pathways. These findings have led us to posit that for hives exposed to similar chemicals, those that incur multiple, simultaneous xenobiotic stressors have a greater incidence of infection with N. ceranae. Mechanistically, our results suggests the overwhelming nature of these exposures negatively affects the biological functioning of the bee, and could explain how the decline in bee populations is associated with pesticide exposures.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0213249,14,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Honey bee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiota promotes host endogenous detoxification capability via regulation of P450 gene expression in the digestive tract,685,JOUR,"['Wu, Y.', 'Zheng, Y.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Wang, S.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Hu, F.', 'Zheng, H.']",Microbial Biotechnology,"There is growing number of studies demonstrating a close relationship between insect gut microbiota and insecticide resistance. However, the contribution of the honey bee gut microbiota to host detoxification ability has yet to be investigated. In order to address this question, we compared the expression of cytochrome P450s (P450s) genes between gut microbiota deficient (GD) workers and conventional gut community (CV) workers and compared the mortality rates and the pesticide residue levels of GD and CV workers treated with thiacloprid or tau-fluvalinate. Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees. Taken together, our results demonstrated that honey bee gut symbiont could contribute to bee health through the modification of the host xenobiotics detoxification pathways and revealed a potential negative impact of antibiotics to honey bee detoxification ability and health. © 2020 The Authors.

Honey bee colony behavior and ontogeny are adversely affected when exposed to a pesticide-contaminated environment,389,JOUR,"['Tokach, R.', 'Smart, A.', 'Fassbinder-Orth, C.', 'Fong, C.', 'Wald, K.', 'Wu-Smart, J.']",Journal of Insect Science,"Honey bees exhibit age polyethism and thus have a predictable sequence of behaviors they express through developmental time. Numerous laboratory studies show exposure to pesticides may impair critical honey bee behaviors (brood care, foraging, egg-laying, etc.) that adversely affect colony productivity and survival. There are fewer studies that examine the impacts of pesticides in natural field settings, especially given the challenges of implementing treatment groups and controlling variables. This study helps address the need for impact studies on pollinators under field conditions to assess the consequences of chemical overuse and dependency in agricultural and urban landscapes. To assess the impact of systemic pesticides in a natural field setting on worker bee behavioral development, observation hives were established to monitor changes in behaviors of similarly aged workers and sister queens within 2 experimental groups: (i) colonies located near point-source systemic pesticide pollution (pesticide contaminated treatment), and (ii) colonies embedded within a typical Midwestern US agricultural environment (control). In this study, worker bees in the contaminated environment exhibited important and biologically significant behavioral differences and accelerated onset of hive tasks (i.e., precocious behavioral development) compared to similarly aged bees at the control site. Queen locomotion was largely unaffected; however, the egg-laying rate was reduced in queens at the contaminated (treated) site. These results show that environmental pesticide exposure can disrupt colony function and adversely affect worker bee behavioral maturation, leading to reduced worker longevity and decreased colony efficiency. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,10.1093/jisesa/ieae034,24,0.0,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Honey bee foraging ability suppressed by imidacloprid can be ameliorated by adding adenosine,472,JOUR,"['Lin, Y.-C.', 'Lu, Y.-H.', 'Tang, C.-K.', 'Yang, E.-C.', 'Wu, Y.-L.']",Environmental Pollution,"Honey bees are important pollinators in most ecosystem, but they are currently facing many threats, which have led to a reduction in their population. Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid pesticide can impair the memory and learning ability of honey bees, which can eventually lead to a decline in their foraging and homing abilities. In this study, we investigated the homing ability barrier from the perspective of energy supply. We believe that when worker bees experience stress, their energy supply may shift from pro-movement to pro-resistance; this will lead to inadequate energy provision to the flight muscles, causing a reduction in wingbeat frequency and impairing the flight ability of the worker bees. To test this, the worker bees were treated with imidacloprid, and wing beats between the treatment groups were compared. Their glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and ATP contents were also measured, and their genes for energy metabolism and resistance were analyzed. The addition of adenosine improved the ATP content and helped recover the wingbeat frequency of the worker bees. The preliminary results obtained showed that wingbeat frequency and glucose content in the worker bees treated with imidacloprid were significantly lower than those in the control group. This result is consistent with our hypothesis and demonstrates that energy supply imbalances can prevent worker bees from returning to their hives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121920,332,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicides can potentiate insecticides by impairing the production of detoxification enzymes. As both DMI fungicides and insecticides can be used near or during crop bloom, the combination may be hazardous if exposed to pollinators. Using pesticides used in blueberry or apple production, we conducted laboratory bioassays to test how combinations of field-relevant concentrations of DMI fungicides and insecticides affected honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival. We found propiconazole, a DMI fungicide, potentiated the toxicity of the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid. We found no evidence of propiconazole potentiating field-relevant concentrations of the spinosyn insecticide spinetoram. We also found that the DMI fungicide flusilazole potentiated spinetoram but not acetamiprid. A fungicidal formulation combining pyraclostrobin and boscalid did not potentiate either insecticide. Given that bees can be simultaneously exposed to multiple pesticides, understanding the potential of pesticide potentiation and synergism may help mitigate risks associated with pollinator exposure to pesticides.",2017,10.1139/facets-2017-0025,2,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

Thus, hives exhibited short-term resilience. Using a demographic matrix model, we found that the basis of resilience in dosed colonies was a substantive increase in brood initiation rate to compensate for increased brood mortality. However, computer simulation of full size colonies revealed that the increase in brood initiation led to severe reductions in colony reproduction (swarming) and long-term survival.

Honeybee gut bacterial strain improved survival and gut microbiota homeostasis in Apis mellifera exposed in vivo to clothianidin,410,JOUR,"['El Khoury, S.', 'Gauthier, J.', 'Mercier, P.L.', 'Moïse, S.', 'Giovenazzo, P.', 'Derome, N.']",Microbiology spectrum,"Pesticides are causing honeybee mortality worldwide. Research carried out on honeybees indicates that application of pesticides has a significant impact on the core gut community, which ultimately leads to an increase in the growth of harmful pathogens. Disturbances caused by pesticides also affect the way bacterial members interact, which results in gut microbial dysbiosis. Administration of beneficial microbes has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating or preventing disease in honeybees. The objective of this study was to measure under in vivo conditions the ability of two bacterial strains (the Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea sp.) isolated from honeybee gut to improve survival and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in honeybees exposed to a sublethal clothianidin dose (0.1 ppb). Both gut bacterial strains were selected for their ability to degrade clothianidin in vitro regardless of their host-microbe interaction characteristics (e.g., beneficial, neutral, or harmful). To this end, we conducted cage trials on 4- to 6-day-old newly emerging honeybees. During microbial administration, we jointly monitored the taxonomic distribution and activity level of bacterial symbionts quantifying 16S rRNA transcripts. First, curative administration of the Pantoea sp. strain significantly improved the survival of clothianidin-exposed honeybees compared to sugar control bees (i.e., supplemented with sugar [1:1]). Second, curative administration of the Enterobacter sp. strain significantly mitigated the clothianidin-induced dysbiosis observed in the midgut structural network, but without improving survival. IMPORTANCE: The present work suggests that administration of bacterial strains isolated from honeybee gut may promote recovery of gut microbiota homeostasis after prolonged clothianidin exposure, while improving survival.

Here, we examined and quantified the effects of N. ceranae, the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, the phenylpyrazole fipronil and the carboxamide boscalid, alone and in combination, on the honeybee gut microbiota. Chronic exposures to fipronil and thiamethoxam alone or combined with N. ceranae infection significantly decreased honeybee survival whereas the fungicide boscalid had no effect on uninfected bees. Interestingly, increased mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected bees after exposure to boscalid, with synergistic negative effects. Regarding gut microbiota composition, co-exposure to the parasite and each pesticide led to decreased abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, and increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria. The parasite also induced an increase of bacterial alpha-diversity (species richness).

However, honeybees are being threatened by highly effective pesticides such as neonicotinoids, which can have detrimental impacts on honeybee foraging in particular. In a colony, nectar and pollen foragers play distinct roles in sustaining the colony. Despite evidence of sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees, little is known about how neonicotinoids affect the foraging behaviour of an entire colony. Here, we conducted a field study using our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated monitoring technology to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field-realistic sub-lethal doses on colony foraging behaviour. A mechanistic simulation model (BEEHAVE) was then used to reproduce and interpret field observations, and further identify the plausible mechanisms underlying the empirical findings. Surprisingly, the field study revealed that imidacloprid greatly reduced pollen foraging but not nectar foraging. In addition, no lethal effects on honeybees were observed. The simulations showed that the time spent by pollen foragers on completing their foraging trips was significantly increased, which subsequently decreased the number of pollen foraging trips per day, thereby reducing pollen foraging at the colony level. This suggests that pollen and nectar foraging may require different energetic costs, cognitive functions, and/or gene expressions, which implies different susceptibilities of pollen and nectar foragers to chemical stressors. As pollen foraging is essential for brood rearing, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids, together with other stressors, may affect colony survival and resilience more than previously thought.",2024,10.1016/j.compag.2024.108966,221,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

The pollination carried out by the honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is crucial in increasing the productivity of the melon (Cucumis melo L.). The main objective of this study was to assess if insecticides applied in the cultivation of cantaloupe melon exhibit significant levels of toxicity toward A. mellifera. We tested the toxicity of azadirachtin, pyriproxyfen, chlorantraniliprole, and imidacloprid, which are commonly sprayed to manage melon pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.)

Three treatments were carried out, 0.0x, 0.1x and 1.0x the concentration recommended by the manufacturer for the control of those pests. Repellency tests, analysis of mortality through contact and ingestion, and flight tests were performed. The insecticide imidacloprid caused mortality rates above 90% in all tested exposure pathways, displaying high residue persistence on plants. Although not causing significant mortality in the ingestion test, pyriproxyfen caused significant mortality after exposure through contact, and change in flight ability. Azadirachtin caused mortality in the ingestion test and impaired the flight ability of bees, while chlorantraniliprole only impaired the flight ability. Moreover, bees were not repelled by these insecticides, suggesting that they may collect contaminated food in the field while foraging.

Imidacloprid is a chloronicotinyl insecticide, which has a highly specific affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the honeybee's nervous system. So it may interfere with dance behavior and memory formation. We found the waggle dances were modulated in honeybees fed sucrose water containing imidacloprid (pesticide group) compared to those fed normal sucrose water (control group). In our data, dancers of the pesticide group significantly increased the variance of divergence angle and the return phases in waggle dances than the control group. And the dance followers in pesticide group significantly increased the variance of crop content than the control group. Furthermore, four learning and memory related genes were significantly regulated at the gene expression levels between pesticide and control group. Our data revealed that the sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid impaired the honeybees’ learning and memory and resulted in cognitive disorder. The dancers may adjust their recruitment behavior leading to the observed reduced number of followers.

Honeybees Produce Millimolar Concentrations of Non-Neuronal Acetylcholine for Breeding: Possible Adverse Effects of Neonicotinoids,225,JOUR,"['Wessler, I', 'Gärtner, HA', 'Michel-Schmidt, R', 'Brochhausen, C', 'Schmitz, L', 'Anspach, L', 'Grünewald, B', 'Kirkpatrick, CJ']",PLOS ONE,"The worldwide use of neonicotinoid pesticides has caused concern on account of their involvement in the decline of bee populations, which are key pollinators in most ecosystems. Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to >= 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food.",2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0156886,11,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,
Honeybees fail to discriminate floral scents in a complex learning task after consuming a neonicotinoid pesticide,709,JOUR,"['Mustard, J.A.', 'Gott, A.', 'Scott, J.', 'Chavarria, N.L.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoids are pesticides used to protect crops but with known secondary influences at sublethal doses on bees. Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates. © 2020.

To examine on-farm exposure to pesticides in invertebrate pollinators, we also collected bumble bees native to Canada (Bombus mixtus, Bombus flavifrons, and Bombus melanopygus), their pollen, and blueberry leaves and flowers from within conventionally sprayed and organic blueberry farms. By sites and sample type, the results reported in the present study represent pooled samples (n = 1). In 2015 to 2016, the combined concentration of the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin detected in hummingbird cloacal fluid from sites near conventionally sprayed blueberry fields was 3.63 ng/mL (ppb). Among the 18 compounds measured in fecal pellets, including one neonicotinoid (imidacloprid), only piperonyl butoxide was detected (1.47–5.96 ng/g). Piperonyl butoxide is a cytochrome P450 inhibitor applied with some insecticides to increase their toxic efficacy. Only diazinon was detected in bumble bees (0.197 ng/g), whereas diazinon (1.54–1.7 ng/g) and imidacloprid (up to 18.4 ng/g) were detected in pollen collected from bumble bees including the bees from organic sites located near conventionally sprayed blueberry farms.

In this study, we isolated and characterized an MsrB gene from Apis cerana cerana F., designated AccMsrB. The full cDNA of AccMsrB was 757 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 414 bp, and the predicted translation product was a 137 amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 15.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.77. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that AccMsrB shares high identity with other known MsrBs (Apis florea F., Apis mellifera L., Apis dorsata F., and Bombus terrestris L.) and contains conservative Cys residues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed AccMsrB to be highly expressed in the epidermis of adult workers, reaching high levels in first-instar larvae, prepupae, and 15-d-old adults. Furthermore, the expression of AccMsrB was upregulated by various oxidative stresses, including 4, 16, 25, and 42 degrees C, ultraviolet light (30 mj/cm(2)), H2O2, CdCl2, HgCl2, paraquat, imidacloprid, and cyhalothrin.

Identification of circular RNAs and corresponding regulatory networks reveals potential roles in the brains of honey bee workers exposed to dinotefuran,113,JOUR,"['Huang, M.', 'Dong, J.', 'Guo, H.', 'Xiao, M.', 'Wang, D.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Honey bees are important and highly efficient pollinators of agricultural crops and have been negatively affected by insecticides in recent years. Circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important role in the regulation of multiple biological and pathological processes; however, its role in the honey bee brain after exposure to dinotefuran is not well understood. Here, the expression profiles and potential modulation networks of circRNAs in the brains of workers (Apis mellifera) were comprehensively investigated using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 33, 144, and 211 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified on the 1st, 5th and 10th days after exposure to dinotefuran, respectively. Enrichment analyses revealed that the host genes of DE circRNAs were enriched in the Hippo signaling pathway-fly, Wnt signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. circ_0002266, circ_0005080, circ_0010239 and circ_0005415 were found to have translational potential due to the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An integrated analysis of the DE circRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks suggest that circ_0008898 and circ_0001829 may participate in the immune response to dinotefuran exposure by acting as miRNA sponges.

Identification of long noncoding RNAs reveals the effects of dinotefuran on the brain in Apis mellifera (Hymenopptera: Apidae),210,JOUR,"['Huang, M.', 'Dong, J.', 'Guo, H.', 'Xiao, M.', 'Wang, D.']",BMC Genomics,"Background: Dinotefuran (CAS No. 165252–70-0), a neonicotinoid insecticide, has been used to protect various crops against invertebrate pests and has been associated with numerous negative sublethal effects on honey bees. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in mediating various biological and pathological processes, involving transcriptional and gene regulation. The effects of dinotefuran on lncRNA expression and lncRNA function in the honey bee brain are still obscure. Results: Through RNA sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed following exposure to 0.01 mg/L dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d. In total, 312 lncRNAs and 1341 mRNAs, 347 lncRNAs and 1458 mRNAs, and 345 lncRNAs and 1155 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the dinotefuran-treated group showed enrichment in carbohydrate and protein metabolism and immune-inflammatory responses such as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and Hippo and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Moreover, the DE lncRNA TCONS_00086519 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may serve as a competing endogenous RNA and a regulatory factor in the immune response to dinotefuran.

Identification of the cytochrome P450 gene AccCYP6A13 in Apis cerana cerana and its response to environmental stress,169,JOUR,"['Lei, L.', 'Gao, Z.', 'Zhao, Q.', 'Wang, C.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Wang, H.', 'Chi, X.', 'Xu, B.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Cytochrome P450 plays a crucial role in regulating insect growth, development, and resisting a variety of stresses. Insect metamorphosis and response to external stress are altered by deleting CYP450 genes. In this study, we identified and analyzed a novel gene of CYP450 family, AccCYP6A13, from Apis cerana cerana, and explored its role in the response of Apis cerana cerana to adverse external stressors. It was found that the expression of AccCYP6A13 was spatiotemporal specificity. The expression level increased with age and reached its highest value in the adult stage. The primarily expressiong location were legs, brain, and epidermis of honeybees. Stress conditions can affect the expression of AccCYP6A13 depending on treatment times. RNA interference experiments have shown that knocking down AccCYP6A13 reduces antioxidant activity and deactivates detoxification enzymes, resulting in oxidative damage accumulation and a decline in detoxification capability in bees, as well as inhibiting numerous antioxidant genes. Additionally, knockdown of the AccCYP6A13 gene in Apis cerana cerana resulted in increased sensitivity to pesticides and increased mortality when treated with neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam. AccCYP6A13 overexpression in a prokaryotic system further confirmed its role in resistance to oxidative stress. To summarize, AccCYP6A13 may play an essential role in the normal development and response to environmental stress in Apis cerana cerana.

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Imidacloprid (IMD) is a pesticide used worldwide. No information exists on how IMD impact the bees’ body bioelement balance, which is essential for bee health. We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health. Consequently, there is a need for developing methods of bioelement supplementation of the honey bee diet for better preventing bee colony decline and protecting apian health status when faced with pesticides. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,10.3390/ani13040615,13,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,
Imidacloprid activates ROS and causes mortality in honey bees (Apis mellifera) by inducing iron overload,78,JOUR,"['He, B.', 'Liu, Z.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Cheng, L.', 'Qing, Q.', 'Duan, J.', 'Xu, J.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.', 'Li, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide widely used for insect pest control, has become a potential pollutant to pollinators. Previous reports have demonstrated the toxicity of this drug in activating oxidative stress resulting in high mortality in the honey bee Apis mellifera. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid have not been fully elucidated. In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload. This study helps to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid from the perspective of iron metabolism. © 2021",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112709,228,,0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 μg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 μg/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 μg/L and 40 μg/L imidacloprid. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee decision-making and other advanced cognitive functions should be explored.

The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI). Finally, in both insects nAChRs, THI is consistently found to bind more favourably than IMI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2015,10.1016/j.jmgm.2014.10.018,55,,0,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Imidacloprid decreases honey bee survival rates but does not affect the gut microbiome,816,JOUR,"['Raymann, K.', 'Motta, E.V.S.', 'Girard, C.', 'Riddington, I.M.', 'Dinser, J.A.', 'Moran, N.A.']",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have played a role in the increased rate of honey bee colony loss. One of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Although the primary mode of action of imidacloprid is on the insect nervous system, it has also been shown to cause changes in insects' digestive physiology and alter the microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The honey bee gut microbiome plays a major role in bee health. Although many studies have shown that imidacloprid affects honey bee behavior, its impact on the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the gut microbiome composition, survivorship, and susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees. Consistent with other studies, we show that imidacloprid exposure results in an elevated mortality of honey bees in the hive and increases the susceptibility to infection by pathogens. However, we did not find evidence that imidacloprid affects the gut bacterial community of honey bees. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that honey bee gut bacteria can grow in the presence of imidacloprid, and we found some evidence that imidacloprid can be metabolized in the bee gut environment. However, none of the individual bee gut bacterial species tested could metabolize imidacloprid, suggesting that the observed metabolism of imidacloprid within in vitro bee gut cultures is not caused by the gut bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that imidacloprid causes increased mortality in honey bees, but this mortality does not appear to be linked to the microbiome. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",2018,10.1128/AEM.00545-18,84,,0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,

However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy.

Experimental and molecular modeling approaches,398,JOUR,"['Ali, H.M.', 'Abdel-Aty, B.', 'El-Sayed, W.', 'Mariy, F.M.', 'Hegazy, G.M.', 'Mohamed, R.A.', 'Zoghly, H.M.']",Chemosphere,"Although the neonicotinoid insecticides have good selectivity towards insects rather than vertebrates, they have severe effects on honeybee production and pollination activities. Therefore, the effects of imidacloprid (IMI), the most used neonicotinoid, on the two main bioreceptors, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (nAChRα1) of honeybees were examined to identify their roles in honeybee toxicity and possible binding sites which assist in selecting and designing neonicotinoids. In vivo, IMI showed a high inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 5.63 mg/L); however, the effect was much lower in vitro experiment (IC50 719 mg/L). This result induced us to examine the IMI effect on AChE gene expression which revealed that the AChE-2 gene expression was severely affected by IMI explaining the observed high enzyme inhibition. In addition, although toxicity increased by increasing exposure to IMI (LC50 2.9 mg/L after 4h and 0.75 mg/L after 48h), AChE was not elevated (IC50 5.63 and 5.52 mg/L respectively). Besides, Despite resuming most enzyme activity (77% during 2 h and 84.14% after 4 h), a high mortality level was observed with LC50 2.9 mg/L. These results reinforced that the observed high toxicity is a multifactor process. Accordingly, Molecular modeling and docking of IMI into honeybee AChE and nAChRα1were also performed to examine their possible interactions and identify the important binding sites. Results models indicated that the first two binding sites in AChE were found in the esteratic subunit in the active site explaining the observed in vitro inhibition. In nAChRα1, four of the highest five free energy binding sites are located in the large TM3-TM4 loop and one in the extracellular loops. Consequently, the present work revealed that IMI toxicity is attributed to various factors including direct interaction with both AChE and nAChRα1 as well as downregulating AChE-2 gene expression. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141899,356,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Imidacloprid impairs performance on a model flower handling task in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens),243,JOUR,"['Phelps, JD', 'Strang, CG', 'Sherry, DF']",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides collect less pollen on foraging trips. Exposed bumblebees are also slower to learn to handle flowers, which may account for reduced pollen collection. It is unclear, however, why neonicotinoid exposure slows learning to handle flowers. We investigated the effect of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, on bumblebee motor learning using a lab model of flower handling. Bumblebees learned to invert inside a narrow tube and lift a petal-shaped barrier to reach a reward chamber. Imidacloprid-exposed bumblebees showed a dose-dependent delay to solve the task, which resulted from reduced switching between behavioural strategies and a subsequent delay in use of the successful strategy. This effect was consistent in colonies exposed at 10 but not 2.6 ppb, suggesting a variable effect on individuals at lower doses. These results help to explain why exposed bumblebees are slow to learn to handle flowers and collect less pollen on foraging trips.",2020,10.1007/s10646-020-02182-8,29,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Imidacloprid intensifies its impact on honeybee and bumblebee cellular immune response when challenged with LPS (lippopolysacharide) of Escherichia coli,131,JOUR,"['Walderdorff, L', 'Laval-Gilly, P', 'Bonnefoy, A', 'Falla-Angel, J']",JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,"Insect hemocytes play an important role in insects' defense against environmental stressors as they are entirely dependent on their innate immune system for pathogen defense. In recent years a dramatic decline of pollinators has been reported in many countries. The drivers of this declines appear to be associated with pathogen infections like viruses, bacteria or fungi in combination with pesticide exposure. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the impact of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, on the cellular immune response of two pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) during simultaneous immune activation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of Escherichia coli. For this purpose the phagocytosis capacity as well as the production of H2O2 and NO of larval hemocytes, exposed to five different imidacloprid concentrations in vitro, was measured. All used pesticide concentrations showed a weakening effect on phagocytosis with but also without LPS activation. Imidacloprid decreased H2O2 and increased NO production in honeybees. Immune activation by LPS clearly reinforced the effect of imidacloprid on the immune response of hemocytes in all three immune parameters tested. Bumblebee hemocytes appeared more sensitive to imidacloprid during phagocytosis assays while imidacloprid showed a greater impact on honeybee hemocytes during H2O2 and NO production.",2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.05.002,108,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Imidacloprid slows the development of preference for rewarding food sources in bumblebees (Bombus impatiens),837,JOUR,"['Phelps, J.D.', 'Strang, C.G.', 'Gbylik-Sikorska, M.', 'Sniegocki, T.', 'Posyniak, A.', 'Sherry, D.F.']",Ecotoxicology,"Bee pollination is economically and ecologically vital and recent declines in bee populations are therefore a concern. One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1883-3,27,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Imidacloprid-induced impairment of mushroom bodies and behavior of the native stingless bee melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides,978,JOUR,"['van Tomé, H.V.', 'Martins, G.F.', 'Lima, M.A.P.', 'Campos, L.A.O.', 'Guedes, R.N.C.']",PLoS ONE,"Declines in pollinator colonies represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 μg active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. © 2012 Tomé et al.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0038406,7,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

We suppose that caffeine might be one of these nutrients. We exposed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to 0.7 or 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid, 5.0 μg/mL caffeine in syrup, or 5.0 μg/mL caffeine in syrup plus 0.7 or 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid. After 72 h, the oxidative status and the food intake were verified. Imidacloprid increased glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. Caffeine alone or with 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid also stimulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase but did not alter the effect of the insecticide on the catalase activity. A significant reduction in the concentration of the thiol group of proteins was observed in the two imidacloprid-fed groups, and the addition of caffeine protected these groups. Imidacloprid increased the malondialdehyde concentration while the addition of caffeine partially decreased this effect. Food intake was higher for bees treated with 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid. Our results show that imidacloprid increased the food intake resulting in oxidative damage, which was partially reversed by caffeine.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of imidacloprid, orally, topically, and by contact, on A. mellifera workers and to verify the presence of this active ingredient in honey. Toxicity levels were verified by bioassays. In bioassay 1, the levels correspond to the percentages of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01% of the recommended concentration for field application of the commercial product Nortox® (active ingredient imidacloprid), with which we obtained the mean lethal concentration (LC50) in 48 h for A. mellifera, determining the concentration ranges to be used in the subsequent bioassays. Bioassays 2 and 3 followed the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which specify the LC50 (48 h). In bioassay 4, the LC50 (48 h) and the survival rate of bees for a period of 120 h were determined by contact with a surface contaminated with imidacloprid, and in bioassay 5, the interference of the insecticide with the flight behavior of bees was evaluated. Honey samples were collected in agroecological and conventional georeferenced apiaries and traces of the imidacloprid were detected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) with extraction by SPE C18. Bee survival was directly affected by the concentration and exposure time, as well behavioral performance, demonstrating the residual effect of imidacloprid on A. mellifera workers. Honey samples from a conventional apiary showed detection above the maximum residue limits (MRL) allowed by the European Union (0.05 μg mL−1), but samples from other apiaries showed no traces of this insecticide.

Immune gene expression in developing honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) simultaneously exposed to imidacloprid and Varroa destructor in laboratory conditions,737,JOUR,"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Zorc, M.', 'Gregorc, A.', 'Rinehart, T.', 'Adamczyk, J.', 'Narat, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"The impact of widespread pesticide use in agriculture has been a major concern to the beekeeping industry. Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have a negative impact on honey bees. Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages. All tested honey bees exposed to Varroa had significantly elevated DWV loads.

Immune related gene expression in worker honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) pupae exposed to neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor),833,JOUR,"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Cizelj, I.', 'Zorc, M.', 'Čitar, M.', 'Božič, J.', 'Glavan, G.', 'Narat, M.']",PLoS ONE,"Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. © 2017 Tesovnik et al.

Immunosuppression response to the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid in females and males of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis L.,678,JOUR,"['Brandt, A.', 'Hohnheiser, B.', 'Sgolastra, F.', 'Bosch, J.', 'Meixner, M.D.', 'Büchler, R.']",Scientific Reports,"Solitary bees are frequently exposed to pesticides, which are considered as one of the main stress factors that may lead to population declines. A strong immune defence is vital for the fitness of bees. However, the immune system can be weakened by environmental factors that may render bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid can severely affect the immunocompetence of Osmia bicornis. In detail, males exposed to thiacloprid solutions of 200 and 555 µg/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence - the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph - were impaired in males. In females, however, only a concentration of 555 µg/kg elicited similar immunosuppressive effects. Although males are smaller than females, they consumed more food solution. This leads to a 2.77 times higher exposure in males, probably explaining the different concentration thresholds observed between the sexes. In contrast to honeybees, dietary exposure to thiacloprid did not affect melanisation or wound healing in O. bicornis. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of O. bicornis, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1038/s41598-020-61445-w,10,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,
Impact of Chronic Exposure to Two Neonicotinoids on Honey Bee Antennal Responses to Flower Volatiles and Pheromonal Compounds,592,JOUR,"['Favaro, R.', 'Roved, J.', 'Haase, A.', 'Angeli, S.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Volatile compounds provide important olfactory cues for honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), which are essential for their ecology, behavior, and social communication. In the external environment bees locate food sources by the use of floral scents, while inside the hive, pheromones such as the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) and alarm pheromones serve important functions in regulating colony life and inducing aggressive responses against intruders and parasites. Widely reported alterations of various behaviors in- and outside the hive following exposure to pesticides could therefore be associated with a disturbance of odor sensitivity. In the present study, we tested the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides at field concentrations on the ability of honey bees to perceive volatiles at the very periphery of the olfactory system. Bee colonies were subjected to treatments during the summer with either Imidacloprid or Thiacloprid at sublethal concentrations. Antennal responses to apple (Malus domestica L.) flower volatiles were studied by GC-coupled electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD), and a range of volatiles, a substitute of the QMP, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were tested by electroantennography (EAG). Short-term and long-term effects of the neonicotinoid treatments were investigated on bees collected in the autumn and again in the following spring. Treatment with Thiacloprid induced changes in antennal responses to specific flower VOCs, with differing short- and long-term effects. In the short term, increased antennal responses were observed for benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are common flower volatiles but also constituents of the honey bee sting gland secretions. The treatment with Thiacloprid also affected antennal responses to the QMP and the mandibular alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. In the short term, a faster signal degeneration of the response signal to the positive control citral was recorded in the antennae of bees exposed to Thiacloprid or Imidacloprid. Finally, we observed season-related differences in the antennal responses to multiple VOCs. Altogether, our results suggest that volatile-specific alterations of antennal responses may contribute to explaining several behavioral changes previously observed in neonicotinoid-exposed bees. Treatment effects were generally more prominent in the short term, suggesting that adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure may not persist across generations.

Impact of Chronic Neonicotinoid Exposure on Honeybee Colony Performance and Queen Supersedure,289,JOUR,"['Sandrock, C', 'Tanadini, M', 'Tanadini, LG', 'Fauser-Misslin, A', 'Potts, SG', 'Neumann, P']",PLOS ONE,"Background: Honeybees provide economically and ecologically vital pollination services to crops and wild plants. During the last decade elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (-28%) and brood (-13%), as well as a reduction in honey production (-29%) and pollen collections (-19%), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: queen supersedure was observed for 60% of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background. Conclusions/Significance: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner. Further, we highlight the importance of the genetic basis of neonicotinoid susceptibility in honeybees which can vary substantially.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0103592,9,,0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

How such diversity influences neonicotinoid sensitivity of nAChRs of beneficial insect species remains poorly understood. We have identified a RIC-3 variant expressed most abundantly in the thoracic ganglia of honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers and investigated its effects on the functional expression and pharmacology of Amα1/Amα8/Amβ1 and Amα1/Amα2/Amα8/Amβ1 nAChRs expressed in X. laevis oocytes. The AmRIC-3 enhanced the response amplitude to the acetylcholine (ACh) of these A. mellifera nAChRs when its cRNA was injected into oocytes at low concentrations but suppressed the ACh response amplitude at high concentrations. Co-expression of the AmRIC-3 had a minimal impact on the affinity of ACh, but changed the efficacy of imidacloprid and clothianidin, suggesting that the presence and the level of RIC-3 expression can affect the nAChR responses to ACh and neonicotinoids, depending on nAChR subunit composition in honeybees. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024,10.1002/ps.8371,,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

We carried out three independent experiments to study the impact of acute oral treatment of 20 μL TMX at concentrations of 2.4 ppb (0.048 ng/bee) and 10 ppb (0.2 ng/bee) on the homing, flight, learning acquisition and short-term retention ability of A. cerana. The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results: When treated with 10 ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4 ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability. Bees treated with either 2.4 ppb or 10 ppb TMX had significantly lower learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Conclusion: Results suggest that acute oral exposure to 10 ppb of TMX altered the short-distance homing time, flight ability, and learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Our study also highlights the concern that acute oral exposure to a low concentration of 2.4 ppb could have consequences on the behavior of A. creana. Those multiple sublethal alterations on A. cerana's behavior indicate that TMX are likely having complex but negative consequences on bee health in the field. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2019,10.1002/ps.5411,75,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Impact of controlled neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees in a realistic field setting,219,JOUR,"['Arce, AN', 'David, TI', 'Randall, EL', 'Rodrigues, AR', 'Colgan, TJ', 'Wurm, Y', 'Gill, RJ']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

The objective of this study was to investigate the direct contact toxicity of five technical grade insecticides - imidacloprid, clothianidin, delta-methrin, spinosad, and novaluron - currently used, or with potential for use in canola integrated pest management on bees that may forage in canola: common eastern bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson); hereafter bumble bees], alfalfa leafcutting bees [Megachile rotundata (F.)], and Osmia lignaria Cresson. Clothianidin and to a lesser extent imidacloprid were highly toxic to all three species, deltamethrin and spinosad were intermediate in toxicity, and novaluron was nontoxic. Bumble bees were generally more tolerant to the direct contact applications > O. lignaria > leafcutting bees. However, differences in relative toxicities between the three species were not consistent, e.g., whereas clothianidin was only 4.9 and 1.3× more toxic, deltamethrin was 53 and 68× more toxic to leafcutting bees than to bumble bees and O. lignaria, respectively. Laboratory assessment of direct contact toxicity, although useful, is only one measure of potential impact, and mortality under field conditions may differ greatly depending on management practices. Research conducted using only honey bees as the indicator species may not adequately reflect the risk posed by insecticides to wild bees because of their unique biology and differential susceptibility.

One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

We also analyzed the relative amount of hemocytes in TMX and/or Nosema-exposed bees. Newly emerged bees were exposed individually per os to TMX, at doses of 0.0856 ng/bee or 0.00856 ng/bee, or to TMX doses and 60,000 spores of N. ceranae per bee. Eight days after the single exposure, the results showed that TMX was extremely deleterious to the HNS at 0.00856 ng/bee, dramatically inducing morphological changes in HNS cells (trophocytes and oenocytes) and increasing hemocyte number. However, the treatment to TMX at 0.00856 ng/bee with additional NOS inoculation provoked the highest critical damage observed on HNS, collapsing the trophocytes, reducing the surface area of oenocytes, and inducing cell death in pericardial cells. Therefore, a sublethal dose of TMX, applied alone or simultaneously with NOS inoculation, triggered the disruption of the HNS and induced progressive damage on worker bees.

Various pesticides have threatened the abundance and diversity of bumblebees. In addition to direct sublethal effects, pesticides may alter the gut microbial communities of bees. Imidacloprid and flupyradifurone insecticides both bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, the latter was assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied to flowering crops. In this study, we assessed the impacts of these two pesticides on queenless microcolonies and the gut microbiota of Bombus terrestris. We found that 10 mu g/L imidacloprid significantly impeded syrup consumption, and post-poned the egg-laying period, larvae, and pupae development. It decreased the relative abundance of the bumblebee-specific symbionts, Apibacter and Lactobacillus Firm-5. On the contrary, 10 mu g/L flupyradifurone did not reduce syrup consumption, block larvae and pupae development in bumble-bees. Although no significant phenotypes were observed, PICRUST revealed that flupyradifurone suppressed pathways, involving carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, translation, and membrane transport.

Impacts of chronic sublethal exposure to clothianidin on winter honeybees,907,JOUR,"['Alkassab, A.T.', 'Kirchner, W.H.']",Ecotoxicology,"A wide application of systemic pesticides and detection of their residues in bee-collected pollen and nectar at sublethal concentrations led to the emergence of concerns about bees’ chronic exposure and possible sublethal effects on insect pollinators. Therefore, special attention was given to reducing unintentional intoxications under field conditions. The sensitivity of winter bees throughout their long lifespan to residual exposure of pesticides is not well known, since most previous studies only looked at the effects on summer bees. Here, we performed various laboratory bioassays to assess the effects of clothianidin on the survival and behavior of winter bees. Oral lethal and sublethal doses were administered throughout 12-day. The obtained LD50 values at 48, 72, 96 h and 10 days were 26.9, 18.0, 15.1 and 9.5 ng/bee, respectively. Concentrations <20 µg/kg were found to be sublethal. Oral exposure to sublethal doses was carried out for 12-day and, the behavioral functions were tested on the respective 13th day. Although slight reductions in the responses at the concentrations 10 and 15 µg/kg were observed, all tested sublethal concentrations had showed non-significant effects on the sucrose responsiveness, habitation of the proboscis extension reflex and olfactory learning performance. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to 15 µg/kg affected the specificity of the early long-term memory (24 h). Since the tested concentrations were in the range of field-relevant concentrations, our results strongly suggest that related-effects on winter and summer bees’ sensitivity should also be studied under realistic conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2016,10.1007/s10646-016-1657-3,25,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumble bee energy metabolism are revealed under nectar starvation,443,JOUR,"['Fischer, N.', 'Costa, C.P.', 'Hur, M.', 'Kirkwood, J.S.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bumble bees are an important group of insects that provide essential pollination services as a consequence of their foraging behaviors. These pollination services are driven, in part, by energetic exchanges between flowering plants and individual bees. Thus, it is important to examine bumble bee energy metabolism and explore how it might be influenced by external stressors contributing to declines in global pollinator populations. Two stressors that are commonly encountered by bees are insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, and nutritional stress, resulting from deficits in pollen and nectar availability. Our study uses a metabolomic approach to examine the effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on bumble bee metabolism, both alone and in combination with nutritional stress. We hypothesized that exposure to imidacloprid disrupts bumble bee energy metabolism, leading to changes in key metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. We tested this by exposing Bombus impatiens workers to imidacloprid according to one of three exposure paradigms designed to explore how chronic versus more acute (early or late) imidacloprid exposure influences energy metabolite levels, then also subjecting them to artificial nectar starvation. The strongest effects of imidacloprid were observed when bees also experienced nectar starvation, suggesting a combinatorial effect of neonicotinoids and nutritional stress on bumble bee energy metabolism. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on pollinators, and underscores the need for further investigation into the complex interactions between environmental stressors and energy metabolism. © 2023 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169388,912,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

However, with an increased reliance on pesticides to enhance crop production, wild bee communities may inadvertently be affected through exposure to chemical residues. Laboratory and semi-field studies have demonstrated lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on limited genera (e.g., Apis, Bombus, Megachile), yet full field studies evaluating impacts to wild bee communities remain limited. Here, we conducted a two-year field study to assess whether neonicotinoid seed treatment and presence in environmental media (e.g., soil, flowers) influenced bee nest and diet guild abundance and richness. In 2017 and 2018, we planted 23 Missouri agricultural fields to soybeans (Glycine max) using one of three seed treatments: untreated (no insecticide), treated (imidacloprid), or previously-treated (untreated, but neonicotinoid use prior to 2017). During both years, wild bees were collected in study field margins monthly (May to September) in tandem with soil and flowers from fields and field margins that were analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. Insecticide presence in soils and flowers varied over the study with neonicotinoids infrequently detected in both years within margin flowers (0%), soybean flowers (<1%), margin soils (<8%), and field soils (~39%). Wild bee abundance and species richness were not significantly different among field treatments. In contrast, neonicotinoid presence in field soils was associated with significantly lower richness (ground- and aboveground-nesting, diet generalists) of wild bee guilds. Our findings support that soil remains an underexplored route of exposure and long-term persistence of neonicotinoids in field soils may lead to reduced diversity in regional bee communities. Future reduction or elimination of neonicotinoid seed treatment use on areas managed for wildlife may facilitate conservation goals to sustain viable, diverse wild bee populations. © 2021",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147299,786,1.0,1,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,

We relate 18 years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up to cause losses of bee biodiversity.

Since most of the native species do not present economic importance, they may suffer “silent extinction”, due to lack of monitoring of their colonies. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the lethal and sublethal concentrations of the insecticide thiamethoxam, with evaluation of its sublethal effects on mobility, in the stingless bee Plebeia catamarcensis (Holmberg, 1903). Foraging bees were collected and exposed to thiamethoxam to determine lethal (LC50) and sublethal concentrations. The 24 h LC50 was 0.408 ng a.i./μL, a value demonstrating that this species may be as sensitive as other stingless bees already studied. Sublethal concentrations influenced the locomotion abilities of the bees, making them hyperactive when exposed to LC50/10 and lethargic when exposed to LC50/100. The effects of sublethal concentrations on individuals may have collective consequences, especially in colonies with few individuals, as is the case of P. catamarcensis. The findings reinforce the hypothesis that thiamethoxam may contribute to the decline of native stingless bees, which can be significantly impacted when chronically exposed to agricultural production systems that use this insecticide, consequently affecting the ecosystem services provided by these bees. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122742,339,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

Our understanding of the risk of imidacloprid to larvae of the honeybees is still in a very early stage. In this study, the capped-brood, pupation and eclosion rates of the honeybee larvae were recorded after treating them directly in the hive with different dosages of imidacloprid. The brood-capped rates of the larvae decreased significantly when the dosages increased from 24 to 8000 ng/larva. However, there were no significant effects of DMSO or 0.4 ng of imidacloprid per larva on the brood-capped, pupation and eclosion rates. Although the sublethal dosage of imidacloprid had no effect on the eclosion rate, we found that the olfactory associative behavior of the adult bees was impaired if they had been treated with 0.04 ng/larva imidacloprid in the larval stage. These results demonstrate that a sublethal dosage of imidacloprid given to the larvae affects the subsequent associative ability of the adult honeybee workers. Thus, a low dose of imidacloprid may affect the survival condition of the entire colony, even though the larvae survive to adulthood.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0049472,7,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Impaired associative learning after chronic exposure to pesticides in young adult honey bees,793,JOUR,"['Gonalons, C.M.', 'Farina, W.M.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoids are the most widespread insecticides in agriculture, preferred for their low toxicity to mammals and their systemic nature. Nevertheless, there have been increasing concerns regarding their impact on non-target organisms. Glyphosate is also widely used in crops and, therefore, traces of this pesticide are likely to be found together with neonicotinoids. Although glyphosate is considered a herbicide, adverse effects have been found on animal species, including honey bees. Apis mellifera is one of the most important pollinators in agroecosystems and is exposed to both these pesticides. Traces can be found in nectar and pollen of flowers that honey bees visit, but also in honey stores inside the hive. Young workers, which perform in-hive tasks that are crucial for colony maintenance, are potentially exposed to both these contaminated resources. These workers present high plasticity and are susceptible to stimuli that can modulate their behaviour and impact on colony state. Therefore, by performing standardised assays to study sublethal effects of these pesticides, these bees can be used as bioindicators. We studied the effect of chronic joint exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and glyphosate on gustatory perception and olfactory learning. Both pesticides reduced sucrose responsiveness and had a negative effect on olfactory learning. Glyphosate also reduced food uptake during rearing. The results indicate differential susceptibility according to honey bee age. The two agrochemicals had adverse effects on different aspects of honey bee appetitive behaviour, which could have repercussions for food distribution, propagation of olfactory information and task coordination within the nest. © 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.",2018,10.1242/jeb.176644,221,,0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Methods used to study learning processes and foraging behaviour were adapted to test the sublethal effects of the insecticide molecule imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl) at both individual and colony levels under confined conditions. At the individual level, we studied the effects of long term ingestion of 4-40 ppb imidacloprid (11 days administration) on olfactory learning performances using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension on restrained bees. At the colony level, a sugar solution containing 50 ppb of imidacloprid was fed to a colony in a flight cage (14 days administration) to determine the effects (1) on the flight activity as measured with an activity counter set at the hive entrance and (2) on the olfactory discrimination performances on an artificial flower feeder. The olfactory conditioning showed that honey bees surviving the diet contaminated with imidacloprid had reduced olfactory learning performances. Only the concentration of 4 ppb induced a percentage of mortality not significantly different from the control diet after long term ingestion. In the flight cage, the administration of imidacloprid led to a decrease in the flight activity and the olfactory discrimination performances. Thus, the decrease in the learning performances induced by imidacloprid at the individual level was confirmed at the colony level. However, it would be necessary to conduct further work on the dose-reponse relationships, and on the sublethal effects of differents pesticides, before concluding about the hazard of imidacloprid on honey bees.",2001,,,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Impairments in learning and memory performances associated with nicotinic receptor expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera after exposure to a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor,558,JOUR,"['Cartereau, A.', 'Pineau, X.', 'Lebreton, J.', 'Mathé-Allainmat, M.', 'Taillebois, E.', 'Thany, S.H.']",PLoS ONE,"Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the Amelβ1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of Amelα9 and Amelβ2, and down-regulation of Amelα1, Amelα3 and Amelα7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affect honeybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

Implementing IPM in crop management simultaneously improves the health of managed bees and enhances the diversity of wild pollinator communities,87,JOUR,"['Pecenka, JR', 'Ingwell, LL', 'Krupke, CH', 'Kaplan, I']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Impacts of insecticide use on the health of wild and managed pollinators have been difficult to accurately quantify in the field. Existing designs tend to focus on single crops, even though highly mobile bees routinely forage across crop boundaries. We created fields of pollinator-dependent watermelon surrounded by corn, regionally important crops in the Midwestern US. These fields were paired at multiple sites in 2017-2020 with the only difference being pest management regimes: a standard set of conventional management (CM) practices vs. an integrated pest management (IPM) system that uses scouting and pest thresholds to determine if/when insecticides are used. Between these two systems we compared the performance (e.g., growth, survival) of managed pollinators-honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)-along with the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators. Compared to CM fields, IPM led to higher growth and lower mortality of managed bees, while also increasing the abundance (+ 147%) and richness (+ 128%) of wild pollinator species, and lower concentrations of neonicotinoids in the hive material of both managed bees. By replicating realistic changes to pest management, this experiment provides one of the first demonstrations whereby tangible improvements to pollinator health and crop visitation result from IPM implementation in agriculture.",2023,10.1038/s41598-023-38053-5,13,1.0,1,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Improved mitochondrial function corrects immunodeficiency and impaired respiration in neonicotinoid exposed bumblebees,195,JOUR,"['Powner, M.B.', 'Priestley, G.', 'Hogg, C.', 'Jeffery, G.']",PLoS ONE,"Neonicotinoid pesticides undermine pollinating insects including bumblebees. However, we have previously shown that mitochondrial damage induced by neonicotinoids can be corrected by 670nm light exposure. But we do not know if this protection extends to immunity or what the minimum effective level of 670nm light exposure is necessary for protection. We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph. Further, this single 1 min exposure remains effective for 3–6 days. Longer exposures were not more effective.

Improving Mitochondrial Function Protects Bumblebees from Neonicotinoid Pesticides,161,JOUR,"['Powner, MB', 'Salt, TE', 'Hogg, C', 'Jeffery, G']",PLOS ONE,"Global pollination is threatened by declining insect pollinator populations that may be linked to neonicotinoid pesticide use. Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria, producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed. Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure were withdrawn, survival was maintained. Bees and insects generally cannot see deep red light so it does not disturb their behaviour. Hence, we show that deep red light exposure that improves mitochondrial function, reverses the sensory and motor deficits induced by Imidacloprid. These results may have important implications as light delivery is economic and can be placed in hives/colonies.",2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0166531,11,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

European foulbrood, caused by the bacterium Melissococcus plutonius, is a disease of honeybee larvae which causes economic hardship for commercial beekeepers, in particular those whose colonies pollinate blueberries. We report for the first time in Canada, an atypical variant of M. plutonius isolated from a blueberry-pollinating colony. With this isolate, we used an in vitro larval infection system to study the effects of pesticide exposure on the development of European foulbrood disease. Pesticide doses tested were excessive (thiamethoxam and pyrimethanil) or maximal field-relevant (propiconazole and boscalid). We found that chronic exposure to the combination of thiamethoxam and propiconazole significantly decreased the survival of larvae infected with M. plutonius, while larvae chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and/or boscalid or pyrimethanil did not experience significant increases in mortality from M. plutonius infection in vitro. Based on these results, individual, calculated field-realistic residues of thiamethoxam and/or boscalid or pyrimethanil are unlikely to increase mortality from European foulbrood disease in honeybee worker brood, while the effects of field-relevant exposure to thiamethoxam and propiconazole on larval mortality from European foulbrood warrant further study.",2020,10.3390/insects11040252,11,,0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

In situ replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder,991,JOUR,"['Lu, C.', 'Warchol, K.M.', 'Callahan, R.A.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The concern of persistent loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies worldwide since 2006, a phenomenon referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), has led us to investigate the role of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in the emergence of CCD. CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.",2012,,65,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
In vitro effects of imidacloprid on honey bee sperm: evaluation using computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA),165,JOUR,"['Inouri-Iskounen, A.', 'Sadeddine-Zennouche, O.', 'Nait Mouloud, M.', 'Kebieche, M.', 'Iguer-Ouada, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Pesticides are considered as the most important factors of pollinators’ decline. Imidacloprid (IMD), belonging to Neonicotinoids class, is widely used as a powerful insecticide but generating important negative effects on honey bees. The current study investigated the direct effect of IMD on bee spermatozoa. The experimental design consisted of in vitro co-incubation of bee gametes with three different concentrations of IMD 1, 10, and 25 μM for 15 min. Conventional microscopic and Computer-aided sperm analyses (CASA) were concomitantly used with a dual goal: to evaluate objectively the effects of IMD on sperm parameters on the one hand and to report computer kinematic parameters in the control group, without IMD treatment, on the other hand. The results revealed apparent negative effects in a dose-dependent manner with motility collapsing completely at 25 μM of IMD. The current results highlighted the direct impact of IMD on bee spermatozoa and revealing the potential subsequent effects on bee reproduction. This study reported also drone computer sperm parameters that could serve as a reference in the studied region. Bee sperm velocities showed the lowest values ever reported in the different animal species.

From the lethal concentration (LC50) of thiamethoxam for the larvae of the Africanized honeybee, we evaluated the sublethal effects of this insecticide on morphology of the brain. After determine the LC50 (14.34ng/μL of diet) of thiamethoxam, larvae were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam equivalent to 1.43ng/μL by acute and subchronic exposure. Morphological and immunocytochemistry analysis of the brains of the exposed bees, showed condensed cells and early cell death in the optic lobes. Additional dose-related effects were observed on larval development.

In vitro larval rearing method of eusocial bumblebee Bombus terrestris for toxicity test,533,JOUR,"['Kato, Y.', 'Kikuta, S.', 'Barribeau, S.M.', 'Inoue, M.N.']",Scientific Reports,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of wild and agricultural plants but recently have been declining due to various stressors, such as pesticides and diseases. Because of the haplo-diploid sex determination system in hymenopterans, experiments using micro-colonies (small sub colonies without a queen) to identify risks to bumblebee health are limited as they are only able to produce males. Therefore, an experimental protocol for rearing bumblebee larvae in vitro is needed to better understand effects on worker larvae. Here, we aimed to establish a rearing method for larvae of Bombus terrestris for use in risk assessment assays. To confirm the validity of our rearing method, we tested two insecticides used for tomato cultivation, chlorfenapyr and dinotefuran. Bombus terrestris larvae fed with a high nutrient quantity and quality diet increased growth per day. All chlorfenapyr-exposed individuals died within 10 days at 2000-fold dilution, an application dose used for tomatoes. There were significant differences in adult emergence rate among almost all chlorfenapyr treatments. On the other hand, sublethal dinotefuran-exposure did not affect rates of pupation and adult emergence, growth, or larval and pupal periods. Although larvae were smaller than in the natural colony, this rearing method for B. terrestris larvae proved to be effective at evaluating realistic sub-colonies to pesticide exposures. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-19965-0,12,0.0,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Increased Acetylcholinesterase Expression in Bumble Bees During Neonicotinoid-Coated Corn Sowing,106,JOUR,"['Samson-Robert, O', 'Labrie, G', 'Mercier, PL', 'Chagnon, M', 'Derome, N', 'Fournier, V']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"While honey bee exposure to systemic insecticides has received much attention, impacts on wild pollinators have not been as widely studied. Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee neuronal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report in situ that bumble bees living in agricultural areas exhibit signs of neonicotinoid intoxication.",2015,10.1038/srep12636,5,0.0,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Increased survival of honeybees in the laboratory after simultaneous exposure to low doses of pesticides and bacteria,309,JOUR,"['Dickel, F', 'Münch, D', 'Amdam, GV', 'Mappes, J', 'Freitak, D']",PLOS ONE,"Recent studies of honeybees and bumblebees have examined combinatory effects of different stressors, as insect pollinators are naturally exposed to multiple stressors. At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation.",2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0191256,13,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,
Indirect effects of agricultural pesticide use on parasite prevalence in wild pollinators,276,JOUR,"['Evans, AN', 'Llanos, JEM', 'Kunin, WE', 'Evison, SEF']",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,"Insect pollinators appear to be experiencing worldwide declines, a phenomenon that has been correlated both with exposure to chemical pesticides and disease prevalence. These factors have been found to have strong and often interacting negative effects on multiple pollinator species in laboratory based studies, however their interactions in the field are less clear. To try and understand the link between pesticide use on pollinator communities, and how this might impact on disease transmission, we took two complementary approaches. First, we undertook a series of pollinator surveys to assess the abundance and diversity of pollinator groups across British agricultural field sites subject to varying levels of pesticide use. We then screened the offspring of two taxa of tube nesting solitary bees (Osmiabicomis and Megachile spp.) for three parasite groups commonly associated with pollinators. We found lower pollinator abundance, group richness and diversity across agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use. Specifically, there were fewer honey bees, hoverflies, solitary bees and wasps. Surprisingly, we found a lower prevalence of all three parasite groups in O. bicomis offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. We also found a lower prevalence of Ascosphaera but a higher prevalence of Microsporidia in Megachile offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. Together, our results suggest that agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use may be affecting pollinators indirectly by disrupting community structure and influencing disease epidemiology and vectoring opportunities. This highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between pesticide use and disease in both managed and wild bee populations for the future mitigation of pollinator declines.",2018,10.1016/j.agee.2018.02.002,258,1.0,1,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Individual and combined impacts of sulfoxaflor andNosema bombion bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) larval growth,79,JOUR,"['Siviter, H', 'Folly, AJ', 'Brown, MJF', 'Leadbeater, E']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Sulfoxaflor is a globally important novel insecticide that can have negative impacts on the reproductive output of bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. However, it remains unclear as to which life-history stage is critically affected by exposure. One hypothesis is that sulfoxaflor exposure early in the colony's life cycle can impair larval development, reducing the number of workers produced and ultimately lowering colony reproductive output. Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasiteNosema bombi,following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) orN. bombiexposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor andN. bombiexposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically). Ultimately, our results suggest that colony-level consequences of sulfoxaflor exposure for bumblebees may be mediated through direct effects on larvae. As sulfoxaflor is licensed for use globally, our findings highlight the need to understand how novel insecticides impact non-target insects at various stages of their development.",2020,10.1098/rspb.2020.0935,287,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

Inert agricultural spray adjuvants may increase the adverse effects of selected insecticides on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) under laboratory conditions,600,JOUR,"['Wernecke, A.', 'Eckert, J.H.', 'Forster, R.', 'Kurlemann, N.', 'Odemer, R.']",Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection,"Currently, more than 360 spray adjuvants are registered in Germany (September 2021). Unlike plant protection products (PPPs), adjuvants are not subjected to regulatory risk assessment. In practice, numerous combinations of PPPs and adjuvants are therefore possible. Thus, tank mixtures containing insecticides that are classified as non-hazardous to bees up to the highest approved application rate or concentration may raise pollinator safety concerns when mixed with efficacy increasing adjuvants and applied in bee-attractive crops. This study analyzes whether selected “PPP–adjuvant” combinations result in increased contact mortality and pose an elevated risk to honey bees. To answer this question, we chose six common spray adjuvants of different classes for laboratory screening. These were then tested in a total of 30 tank mixtures, each with a neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), diamide (chlorantraniliprole), carbamate (pirimicarb), and butenolide (flupyradifurone) formulation. We adapted an acute contact test (OECD Test Guideline 214) to our needs, e.g., by using a professional spray chamber for more realistic exposures. Our results showed that, in total, 50% of all combinations significantly increased the mortality of caged honey bees in comparison with individual application of insecticides. In contrast, none of the adjuvants alone affected bee mortality (Cox proportional hazard model, p > 0.05). With four of the five insecticide formulations, the organosilicone surfactant Break-Thru® S 301 significantly increased bee mortality within 72 h (for all insecticides except chlorantraniliprole).

Inferring pesticide toxicity to honey bees from a field-based feeding study using a colony model and Bayesian inference,581,JOUR,"['Minucci, J.M.', 'Curry, R.', 'DeGrandi-Hoffman, G.', 'Douglass, C.', 'Garber, K.', 'Purucker, S.T.']",Ecological Applications,"Honey bees are crucial pollinators for agricultural crops but are threatened by a multitude of stressors including exposure to pesticides. Linking our understanding of how pesticides affect individual bees to colony-level responses is challenging because colonies show emergent properties based on complex internal processes and interactions among individual bees. Agent-based models that simulate honey bee colony dynamics may be a tool for scaling between individual and colony effects of a pesticide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are developing the VarroaPop + Pesticide model, which simulates the dynamics of honey bee colonies and how they respond to multiple stressors, including weather, Varroa mites, and pesticides. To evaluate this model, we used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit field data from an empirical study where honey bee colonies were fed the insecticide clothianidin. This allowed us to reproduce colony feeding study data by simulating colony demography and mortality from ingestion of contaminated food. We found that VarroaPop + Pesticide was able to fit general trends in colony population size and structure and reproduce colony declines from increasing clothianidin exposure. The model underestimated adverse effects at low exposure (36 µg/kg), however, and overestimated recovery at the highest exposure level (140 µg/kg), for the adult and pupa endpoints, suggesting that mechanisms besides oral toxicity-induced mortality may have played a role in colony declines. The VarroaPop + Pesticide model estimates an adult oral LD50 of 18.9 ng/bee (95% CI 10.1–32.6) based on the simulated feeding study data, which falls just above the 95% confidence intervals of values observed in laboratory toxicology studies on individual bees. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel method for analyzing colony-level data on pesticide effects on bees and making inferences on pesticide toxicity to individual bees. © 2021 The Authors.

Pesticides can be present in pollen, nectar, and persist in stored food (honey and bee bread), and viruses can be highly prevalent in honey bee colonies. Therefore, the present study describes the influence of chronic co-exposure to thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) on bee survival, virus loads, expression level of immune and detoxication genes, and pesticide metabolism Experiments were performed on honey bees collected from a winter apiary with reduced viral contaminations. No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology. © 2019 Coulon et al.

Influence of combined pesticide and parasite exposure on bumblebee colony traits in the laboratory,203,JOUR,"['Fauser-Misslin, A', 'Sadd, B', 'Neumann, P', 'Sandrock, C']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pollinating insects provide vital ecosystem services of enormous importance for economies and biodiversity. Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines.",2014,10.1111/1365-2664.12188,51,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Influence of pesticide residues on honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colony health in France,996,JOUR,"['Chauzat, M.-P.', 'Carpentier, P.', 'Martel, A.-C.', 'Bougeard, S.', 'Cougoule, N.', 'Porta, P.', 'Lachaize, J.', 'Madec, F.', 'Aubert, M.', 'Faucon, J.-P.']",Environmental Entomology,"A 3-yr field survey was carried out in France, from 2002 to 2005, to study honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colony health in relation to pesticide residues found in the colonies. This study was motivated by recent massive losses of honey bee colonies, and our objective was to examine the possible relationship between low levels of pesticide residues in apicultural matrices (honey, pollen collected by honey bees, beeswax) and colony health as measured by colony mortality and adult and brood population abundance. When all apicultural matrices were pooled together, the number of pesticide residue detected per sampling period (four sampling periods per year) and per apiary ranged from 0 to 9, with the most frequent being two (29.6%). No pesticide residues were detected during 12.7% of the sampling periods. Residues of imidacloprid and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the most frequently detected in pollen loads, honey, and honey bee matrices. Several pairs of active ingredients were present concurrently within honey bees and in pollen loads but not in beeswax and honey samples. No statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues. When pesticide residues from all matrices were pooled together, a mixed model analysis did not show a significant relationship between the presence of pesticide residues and the abundance of brood and adults, and no statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues. Thus, although certain pesticide residues were detected in apicultural matrices and occasionally with another pesticide residual, more work is needed to determine the role these residues play in affecting colony health. © 2009 Entomological Society of America.",2009,10.1603/022.038.0302,38,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

They play important roles in regulating caste differentiation, behavior development, and immune defences in the honey bee, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this study, we explored the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on miRNA expression in this species using deep small RNA sequencing. The results showed that seven miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (q-value <0.01 and |log2(fold-change)| >1) upon exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. Some candidate target genes were related to behavior, immunity, and neural function. Several miRNAs, including ame-miR-124, ame-miR-981, ame-miR-3791, and ame-miR-6038, were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis.

Influence of varroa mite (Varroa destructor) management practices on insecticide sensitivity in the honey bee (Apis mellifera),867,JOUR,"['Rinkevich, F.D.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.B.']",Insects,"Since Varroa mites may cause devastating losses of honey bees through direct feeding, transmitting diseases, and increasing pathogen susceptibility, chemical and mechanical practices commonly are used to reduce mite infestation. While miticide applications are typically the most consistent and efficacious Varroa mite management method, miticide-induced insecticide synergism in honey bees, and the evolution of resistance in Varroa mites are reasonable concerns. We treated colonies with the miticide amitraz (Apivar®), used IPM practices, or left some colonies untreated, and then measured the effect of different levels of mite infestations on the sensitivity of bees to phenothrin, amitraz, and clothianidin. Sensitivity to all insecticides varied throughout the year among and within treatment groups. Clothianidin sensitivity decreased with increasing mite levels, but no such correlation was seen with phenothrin or amitraz. These results show that insecticide sensitivity is dynamic throughout the 5 months test. In-hive amitraz treatment according to the labeled use did not synergize sensitivity to the pesticides tested and this should alleviate concern over potential synergistic effects. Since IPM practices were largely ineffective at reducing Varroa mite infestation, reliance on chemical methods of Varroa mite management is likely to continue. However, miticides must be used judiciously so the long term effectiveness of these compounds can be maximized. These data demonstrate the complex and dynamic variables that contribute to honey bee colony health. The results underscore the importance of controlling for as many of these variables as possible in order to accurately determine the effects of each of these factors as they act alone or in concert with others. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2017,10.3390/insects8010009,8,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ingestible hydrogel microparticles improve bee health after pesticide exposure,430,JOUR,"['Caserto, J.S.', 'Wright, L.', 'Reese, C.', 'Huang, M.', 'Salcedo, M.K.', 'Fuchs, S.', 'Jung, S.', 'McArt, S.H.', 'Ma, M.']",Nature Sustainability,"Bees provide crucial pollination services for crop cultivation, contributing billions of dollars to the global agricultural economy. However, exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids represents a major problem for bee health, necessitating strategies that can improve agricultural sustainability and pollinator health. Here we report a simple and scalable solution, through ingestible hydrogel microparticles (IHMs), which can capture neonicotinoids in vitro and in the bee gastrointestinal tract to mitigate the harmful effects of pesticides. Using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) as a model species and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, we demonstrated by means of lethal and sublethal assays the substantial benefits of IHM treatments. Under lethal exposure of imidacloprid, bumblebees that received IHM treatment exhibited a 30% increase in survival relative to groups without IHM treatment. After a sublethal exposure of 5 ng, IHM treatment resulted in improved feeding motivation and a 44% increase in the number of bees that engaged in locomotor activity. Wingbeat frequency was significantly lower after a single 5 or 10 ng imidacloprid dose; however, IHM treatment improved wingbeat frequency. Overall, the IHMs improved bumblebee health, and with further optimization have the potential to benefit apiculture and reduce risk during crop pollination by managed bees. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",2024,10.1038/s41893-024-01432-5,,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Inhibitory effects of four neonicotinoid active ingredients on acetylcholine esterase activity,57,JOUR,"['Gyori, J.', 'Farkas, A.', 'Stolyar, O.', 'Székács, A.', 'Mörtl, M.', 'Vehovszky, Á.']",Acta Biologica Hungarica,"There is a great concern about the decline of pollinators, and neonicotinoids emerging bee disorders are assumed to play a significant role.

AChE activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, and calculated IC                             50                              values for thiamethoxam (IC                             50                              = 414 μM) and clothianidin (IC                             50                              = 160 μM) were found to be much higher compared to acetamiprid (IC                             50                              = 75.2 μM) and thiacloprid (IC                             50                              = 87.8 μM). The Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots for acetamiprid shows unchanged Vmax and increased Km values with inhibitor concentrations, while analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots shows predominantly competitive mechanism. The inhibition constant value (Ki = 24.3 μM) indicates strong binding of the acetamiprid complex to AChE. Finally, the four tested neonicotinoids are not a uniform group regarding their blocking ability. Our results suggest a previously not established, direct AChE blocking mechanism of neonicotinoids tested, thus the neuronal AChE enzyme is likely among the direct targets of the neonicotinoid insecticides. We conclude, that these AChE inhibitory effects may also contribute to toxic effects on the whole exposed animal.                          © 2018 Akademiai Kiado Rt.

Insecticide Susceptibility in Asian Honey Bees (Apis cerana (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Implications for Wild Honey Bees in Asia,862,JOUR,"['Yasuda, M.', 'Sakamoto, Y.', 'Goka, K.', 'Nagamitsu, T.', 'Taki, H.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"To conserve local biodiversity and ensure the provision of pollination services, it is essential to understand the impact of pesticides on wild honey bees. Most studies that have investigated the effects of pesticides on honey bees have focused on the European honey bee (Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)), which is commonly domesticated worldwide. However, the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is widely distributed throughout Asia, and toxicity data are lacking for this species. This study aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. In this study, we determined the acute contact toxicity in A. cerana to various pesticides, including neonicotinoids, fipronil, organophosphorus, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamate, and anthranilic diamide. Based on the test duration of 48 h of contact LD50 tests, A. cerana was most sensitive to dinotefuran (0.0014 lg/bee), followed by thiamethoxam (0.0024 lg/bee) and fipronil (0.0025 lg/bee). Dinotefuran is used extensively in Asia, thereby potentially creating a substantial hazard. More generally, A. cerana was approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than was A. mellifera to most of the pesticides evaluated. The results of our study suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides should not be considered as a single group that acts uniformly on all honey bees, and that more careful management strategies are required to conserve A. cerana populations than A. mellifera.  © The Authors 2017.",2017,10.1093/jee/tox032,110,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,
Insecticide and low food quality treatments reduce health and pollination services of two key pollinator taxa,130,JOUR,"['Birkenbach, M', 'Straub, F', 'Weihermüller, P', 'Wilfert, L', 'Ayasse, M', 'Kuppler, J']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pesticides and the lack of floral resources are key drivers of insect decline in agricultural areas. Both land-use stressors can have a variety of synergistic and sublethal effects on pollinators, affecting their health and foraging behaviour. Pollinating insects include species with vastly different life histories, giving them potentially different vulnerability and resilience to stressors. However, most research has generally focused on bees. Here, we contrast synergistic effects of nutritional stress and pesticide use on social bumblebees and solitary hoverflies. We experimentally tested the effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid and low-quality food on health traits of Bombus terrestris workers and Episyrphus balteatus adults (ovarian development, body size and colony development or survival). The foraging behaviour of treated pollinators was recorded in a semi-field setup and, for B. terrestris, we measured the pollen amount on the body surface and the pollen deposited on stigmata after a single floral visit. Both stressors affected bumblebee health. Additionally, insecticide-treated workers showed increased flower handling times and flight durations, while low-quality food reduced the amount of pollen on the surface of bumblebees and the pollen deposited on stigmata. Syrphids were mostly affected by low-quality food, which decreased their survival probability and changed their foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we found an interactive effect between the two stressors, reducing E. balteatus ovary development. Synthesis and applications. Insecticide and food stress affected fitness traits of both bumblebees and syrphid flies, possibly reducing pollinator populations under natural conditions. Especially for bumblebees, long-term exposure led to a reduction in the provision of pollination services, both by changing their behaviour and reducing pollen transfer. We found differences between the two pollinator groups, showing that results gained from single groups like bees should not be extrapolated to all pollinators. Interactive effects indicate potential buffering effects of high-quality food against other stressors and highlight the importance of considering synergies between multiple stressors in risk assessments. This further emphasizes the relevance of floral resources such as wild flower strips in agricultural areas to conserve pollinators and pollination services.

Studying bumblebee colonies provisioned with neonicotinoid spiked nectar substitute, we measured brain volume and learning behaviour of 3 or 12-day old adults that had experienced in-hive exposure during brood and/or early-stage adult development. Micro-computed tomography scanning and segmentation of multiple brain neuropils showed exposure during either of the developmental stages caused reduced mushroom body calycal growth relative to unexposed workers. Associated with this was a lower probability of responding to a sucrose reward and lower learning performance in an olfactory conditioning test. While calycal volume of control workers positively correlated with learning score, this relationship was absent for exposed workers indicating neuropil functional impairment. Comparison of 3- and 12-day adults exposed during brood development showed a similar degree of reduced calycal volume and impaired behaviour highlighting lasting and irrecoverable effects from exposure despite no adult exposure.

Insecticides cause transcriptional alterations of endocrine related genes in the brain of honey bee foragers,215,JOUR,"['Fent, K.', 'Haltiner, T.', 'Kunz, P.', 'Christen, V.']",Chemosphere,"Bees are exposed to endocrine active insecticides. Here we assessed expressional alteration of marker genes indicative of endocrine effects in the brain of honey bees. We exposed foragers to chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and thiacloprid and assessed the expression of genes after exposure for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Chlorpyrifos caused the strongest expressional changes at 24 h characterized by induction of vitellogenin, major royal jelly protein (mrjp) 2 and 3, insulin-like peptide (ilp1), alpha-glucosidase (hbg3) and sima, and down-regulation of buffy. Cypermethrin caused minor induction of mrjp1, mrjp2, mmp1 and ilp1. The sima transcript showed down-regulation at 48 h and up-regulation at 72 h. Exposure to thiacloprid caused down-regulation of vitellogenin, mrjp1 and sima at 24 h, and hbg3 at 72 h, as well as induction of ilp1 at 48 h. The buffy transcript was down-regulated at 24 h and up-regulated at 48 h. Despite compound-specific expression patterns, each insecticide altered the expression of some of the suggested endocrine system related genes. Our study suggests that expressional changes of genes prominently expressed in nurse or forager bees, including down-regulation of buffy and mrjps and up-regulation of hbg3 and ilp1 may serve as indicators for endocrine activity of insecticides in foragers. © 2020 The Author(s)",2020,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127542,260,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
"Insight into Olfactory Learning, Memory, and Mortality of Apis mellifera jemenitica after Exposure to Acetamiprid Insecticide",384,JOUR,"['Abuagla, M.I.B.', 'Iqbal, J.', 'Raweh, H.S.A.', 'Alqarni, A.S.']",Insects,"The honey bee, a significant crop pollinator, encounters pesticides through various routes of exposure during foraging and flower visitation. Considering the potential threat of pesticide poisoning, the indigenous Saudi bee Apis mellifera jemenitica is susceptible to the risks associated with acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This study investigates the acetamiprid-induced effects on the survival, olfactory learning, and memory formation of A. m. jemenitica through two exposure routes: topical application and oral ingestion. Field-realistic and serially diluted concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 10 ppm) of acetamiprid led to notable mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment, with peak mortality observed at 24 h and 48 h for both exposure routes. Bee mortality was concentration-dependent, increasing with the rising concentration of acetamiprid at the tested time intervals. Food consumption following oral exposure exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern, steadily decreasing with increasing concentrations of acetamiprid. Oral exposure resulted in a substantially higher cumulative mortality (55%) compared to topical exposure (15%), indicating a significant disparity in bee mortality between the two exposure routes. The 24 h post-treatment LC50 values for acetamiprid were 160.33 and 12.76 ppm for topical application and oral ingestion, respectively. The sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of acetamiprid were 15.23, 34.18, and 61.20 ppm, respectively, following topical exposure, and 2.85, 4.77, and 6.91 ppm, respectively, following oral exposure. The sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid significantly decreased learning during the 2nd–3rd conditioning trials and impaired memory formation at 2, 12, and 24 h following both topical and oral exposure routes, compared to the control bees. Notably, the sublethal concentrations were equally effective in impairing bee learning and memory. Taken together, acetamiprid exposure adversely affected bee survival, hindered learning, and impaired the memory retention of learned tasks. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,10.3390/insects15070473,15,,0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,
Insights into the degradation and toxicity difference mechanism of neonicotinoid pesticides in honeybees by mass spectrometry imaging,138,JOUR,"['Zhang, Y', 'Chen, D', 'Du, MY', 'Ma, LL', 'Li, P', 'Qin, R', 'Yang, JR', 'Yin, ZB', 'Wu, XZ', 'Xu, HH']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Honeybees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and flowering plants, whereas they are confronting decline around the world due to the overuse of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids. The mechanism behind the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on honeybees has attracted considerable interest, yet it remains unknown due to the limited insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in honeybees. Herein, we demonstrated the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDIMSI) for the spatiotemporal visualization of neonicotinoids, such as N-nitroguanidine (dinotefuran) and Ncyanoamidine (acetamiprid) compounds, administered by oral application or direct contact, in the whole-body section of honeybees. The MSI results revealed that both dinotefuran and acetamiprid can quickly penetrate various biological barriers and distribute within the whole-body section of honeybees, but acetamiprid can be degraded much faster than dinotefuran. The degradation rate of acetamiprid is significantly decreased when piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is applied, whereas that of dinotefuran remains almost unchanged. These two factors might contribute to the fact that dinotefuran affords a higher toxicity to honeybees than acetamiprid. Moreover, the toxicity and degradation rate of acetamiprid can be affected by co-application with tebuconazole. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the discrepant toxicity between dinotefuran and acetamiprid does not lie in the difference in their of various barriers of but in the degradation rate of neonicotinoid pesticides within honeybee tissues. Moreover, new perspectives are given to better understand the causes of the current decline in honeybee populations posed by insecticides, providing guidelines for the precise use of conventional agrochemicals and the rational design of novel pesticide candidates.

Insights into the effects of sublethal doses of pesticides glufosinate-ammonium and sulfoxaflor on honey bee health,490,JOUR,"['Castelli, L.', 'Branchiccela, B.', 'Zunino, P.', 'Antúnez, K.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Insect pollinators are threatened worldwide, being the exposure to multiple pesticides one of the most important stressor. The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline. © 2022",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161331,868,,0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Intake of imidacloprid in lethal and sublethal doses alters gene expression in Apis mellifera bees,387,JOUR,"['de Castro Lippi, I.C.', 'da Luz Scheffer, J.', 'de Lima, Y.S.', 'Lunardi, J.S.', 'Astolfi, A.', 'Kadri, S.M.', 'Alvarez, M.V.N.', 'de Oliveira Orsi, R.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bees are important pollinators for ecosystems and agriculture; however, populations have suffered a decline that may be associated with several factors, including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to diseases and parasites and use of pesticides. The extensive use of neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid, as agricultural pesticides, leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in bees, pollen, nectar, and honey, thereby inducing deleterious effects. Forager honey bees face significant exposure to pesticide residues while searching for resources outside the hive, particularly systemic pesticides like imidacloprid. In this study, 360 Apis mellifera bees, twenty-one days old (supposed to be in the forager phase) previously marked were fed syrup (honey and water, 1:1 m/v) containing a lethal dose (0.081 μg/bee) or sublethal dose (0.00081 μg/bee) of imidacloprid. The syrup was provided in plastic troughs, with 250 μL added per trough onto each plastic Petri dish containing 5 bees (50 μL per bee). The bees were kept in the plastic Petri dishes inside an incubator, and after 1 and 4 h of ingestion, the bees were euthanised and stored in an ultra-freezer (−80 °C) for transcriptome analysis. Following the 1-h ingestion of imidacloprid, 1516 genes (73 from lethal dose; 1509 from sublethal dose) showed differential expression compared to the control, while after 4 h, 758 genes (733 from lethal dose; 25 from sublethal) exhibited differential expression compared to the control. All differentially expressed genes found in the brain tissue transcripts of forager bees were categorised based on gene ontology into functional groups encompassing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. These analyses revealed that sublethal doses might be capable of altering more genes than lethal doses, potentially associated with a phenomenon known as insecticide-induced hormesis. Alterations in genes related to areas such as the immune system, nutritional metabolism, detoxification system, circadian rhythm, odour detection, foraging activity, and memory in bees were present after exposure to the pesticide. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of both lethal and sublethal doses of imidacloprid, thereby providing valuable insights for establishing public policies regarding the use of neonicotinoids, which are directly implicated in the compromised health of Apis mellifera bees. © 2024",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173393,940,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,
Interaction between Thiamethoxam and Deformed Wing Virus Type A on Wing Characteristics and Expression of Immune and Apoptosis Genes in Apis mellifera,571,JOUR,"['Phokasem, P.', 'Mookhploy, W.', 'Krongdang, S.', 'Sinpoo, C.', 'Chantawannakul, P.']",Insects,"Honey bees are economically important insects for crop pollination. They play a significant role as pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops and produce economical products, such as honey, royal jelly, wax, pollen, propolis, and venom. Despite their ecological and economical importance, the global honey bee population is in decline due to factors including pathogens, parasites, intensive agriculture, and pesticides. Moreover, these factors may be interlinked and exacerbate the loss of honey bees. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between a pesticide, thiamethoxam, and deformed wing virus type A (DWV-A) to honey bees and the effects on survival rate, wing characteristics, and expression of immune and apoptosis genes in Apis mellifera. We described the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A on honey bee wing characteristics, DWV-A loads, and the expressions of immune (defensin, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin) and apoptosis genes (buffy, apaf1, caspase3-like, caspase8-like, and caspase9-like). Honey bee larvae were fed with three different thiamethoxam doses (0.001, 1.4, and 14.3 ng/µL of the diet). Then, thiamethoxam-treated white-eyed pupae were injected with 107 copy numbers/honey bee of the DWV-A genome. The interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A caused a high mortality rate, crippled wings in newly emerged adult honey bees (100%), and resulted in induced expression of hymenoptaecin gene compared to the control group, while downregulation of caspase8-like, caspase9-like genes compared to the DWV injection group. Therefore, the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A might have a deleterious effect on honey bee lifespan. The results from this study could be used as a tool to combat DWV-A infection and mitigate pesticide usage to alleviate the decrease in the honey bee population. © 2022 by the authors.

"Interaction of Flupyradifurone and Deltamethrin, Two Pesticides Commonly Used for Plant Pest Control, in Honeybees",185,JOUR,"Bava, R.; Lupia, C.; Castagna, F.; Ruga, S.; Nucera, S.; Carresi, C.; Caminiti, R.; Bulotta, R.M.; Naccari, C.; Britti, D.; Palma, E.",Animals,"Nowadays, old-generation pesticides are released into ecosystems alongside new formulations, giving rise to pharmacological interactions (additive, synergistic, and antagonistic effects). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that simultaneous exposure to DMT and FLU doses has on bee health. Groups of twenty honeybees were housed in cages to compose six macro-groups. One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticides’ interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for up to three days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day. When DMT and FLU 50 were administered together, the group that received DMT alone had a lower survival rate. When comparing the survival rates produced by the DMT and FLU 50 combination to those of the group receiving FLU 50 alone, the same was clearly visible. While there was no statistically significant improvement observed when the survival indices of the DMT and FLU 100 combination were compared to those of the group intoxicated with DMT alone, an improvement in survival indices was observed when these were compared with the group intoxicated with FLU 100 alone. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,10.3390/ani14060851,14,,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
"Interaction of acetamiprid, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae in honey bees",405,JOUR,"['Kang, Y.', 'Wu, T.', 'Han, B.', 'Yang, S.', 'Wang, X.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Gao, J.', 'Dai, P.']",Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Health of honey bees is threatened by a variety of stressors, including pesticides and parasites. Here, we investigated effects of acetamiprid, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae, which act either alone or in combination. Our results suggested that interaction between the three factors was additive, with survival risk increasing as the number of stressors increased. Although exposure to 150 μg/L acetamiprid alone did not negatively impact honey bee survival, it caused severe damage to midgut tissue. Among the three stressors, V. destructor posed the greatest threat to honey bee survival, and N. ceranae exacerbated intestinal damage and increased thickness of the midgut wall. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that different combinations of stressors elicited specific gene expression responses in honey bees, and genes involved in energy metabolism, immunity, and detoxification were altered in response to multiple stressor combinations. Additionally, genes associated with Toll and Imd signalling, tyrosine metabolism, and phototransduction pathway were significantly suppressed in response to different combinations of multiple stressors. This study enhances our understanding of the adaptation mechanisms to multiple stressors and aids in development of suitable protective measures for honey bees. Environmental Implication: We believe our study is environmentally relevant for the following reasons: This study investigates combined effects of pesticide, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae. These stressors are known to pose a threat to long-term survival of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and stability of the ecosystems. The research provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of honey bees in response to multiple stressors and developing effective conservation strategies. Further research can identify traits that promote honey bee survival in the face of future challenges from multiple stressors to maintain the overall stability of environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.134380,471,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
"Interaction of field realistic doses of clothianidin and Varroa destructor parasitism on adult honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health and neural gene expression, and antagonistic effects on differentially expressed genes",711,JOUR,"['Morfin, N.', 'Goodwin, P.H.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",PLoS ONE,"While many studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor on honey bees (Apis mellifera), more information on the combined effects of such stressors on gene expression, including neural related genes, and their impact on biological pathways is needed. This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors. The reduced numbers of DEGs and KEGG pathways associated with the DEGs for the combined stressors compared to the stressors alone indicates that the interaction of the stressors is not additive or synergistic, but antagonistic. The possible implications of the antagonistic effect on the number of DEGs are discussed. © 2020 Morfin et al.

"Interaction of varroa destructor and sublethal clothianidin doses during the larval stage on subsequent adult honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health, cellular immunity, deformed wing virus levels and differential gene expression",714,JOUR,"['Morfin, N.', 'Goodwin, P.H.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",Microorganisms,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) are exposed to many parasites, but little is known about interactions with abiotic stressors on their health, particularly when affected as larvae. Larvae were exposed singly and in combination to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and three sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin to evaluate their effects on survivorship, weight, haemocyte counts, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression of the adult bees that subsequently developed. Clothianidin significantly reduced bee weight at the highest dose and was associated with an increase in haemocyte counts at the lowest dose, whereas V. destructor parasitism increased DWV levels, reduced bee emergence, lowered weight and reduced haemocyte counts. An interaction between the two stressors was observed for weight at emergence. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), V. destructor infestation resulted in broader down-regulatory effects related to immunity that was often shared with the combined stressors, while clothianidin resulted in a broader up-regulatory effect more related to central metabolic pathways that was often shared with the combined stressors. Parasites and abiotic stressors can have complex interactions, including additive effects on reduced weight, number of up-regulated DEGs and biological pathways associated with metabolism. © 2020 by the authors.

Interaction patterns and combined toxic effects of acetamiprid in combination with seven pesticides on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.),16,JOUR,"['Wang, Y.', 'Zhu, Y.C.', 'Li, W.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (ACT) and seven pesticides [abamectin (ABA), emamectin benzoate (EMB), dicrotophos (DIC), bifenthrin (BIF), cypermethrin (CYP), lambda-cyhalothrin (LCY) and tetraconazole (TET)] are widely applied agrochemicals worldwide. Since most previous studies on these pesticides are performed merely based on toxicity tests with individual active ingredients, only finite knowledge is available on the mixture toxicities of these formulated compounds to crop pollinators. In this study, we examined their toxicities of binary, ternary, quaternary, quinquenary, senary, septenary and octonary mixtures to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) with feeding toxicity test. Results showed that EMB and ABA had the highest toxicities to A. mellifera with LC50 values of 0.033 (0.028–0.038) and 0.047 (0.039–0.056) μg a. i. mL−1 after exposure for 7 days, respectively, followed by DIC with an LC50 value of 1.22 (1.01–1.41) μg a. i. mL−1. In contrast, relatively low toxicities were found from pyrethroid insecticides, ACT, and TET with their LC50 values ranged from 44.76 (38.75–50.89) to 251.7 (198.4–297.3) μg a. i. mL−1. Most of pesticide mixtures containing ACT and TET elicited synergistic interactions to honey bees. Besides, four pesticide mixtures of ACT + BIF, ACT + BIF + CYP, ACT + BIF + LCY and ACT + CYP + DIC + EMB also displayed synergistic effects. Among 98 tested binary to octonary mixtures of ACT in combination with seven pesticides, 44.90% of combinations exhibited synergistic effects on honey bees. Considering ACT was permitted to use on flowering crops, more attention should be paid to its application in the fields due to the synergistic effects of ACT in combination with other pesticides on A. mellifera under laboratory conditions. © 2019",2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.110100,190,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about how co-exposure to stress factors can alter the survival and behavior of free-living honey bees in colony conditions. We therefore studied the potential interaction between a neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, and a highly prevalent honey bee pathogen, Deformed wing virus (DWV). For this purpose, tagged bees were exposed to DWV by feeding or injection, and/or to field-relevant doses of thiamethoxam, then left in colonies equipped with optical bee counters to monitor flight activity. DWV loads and the expression of immune genes were quantified. A reduction in vitellogenin expression level was observed in DWV-injected bees and was associated with precocious onset of foraging. Combined exposure to DWV and thiamethoxam did not result in higher DWV loads compared to bees only exposed to DWV, but induced precocious foraging, increased the risk of not returning to the hive after the first flight, and decreased survival when compared to single stress exposures. We therefore provided the first evidence for deleterious interactions between DWV and thiamethoxam in natural conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Coulon, Dalmon, Di Prisco, Prado, Arban, Dubois, Ribière-Chabert, Alaux, Thiéry and Le Conte.",2020,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00766,11,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weakened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a synergistic interaction and in the long term a higher susceptibility of the colony to pathogens.

How both factors affect gene expression and honey bee survival are well studied. However, only a few studies dealt with the interactions of the two factors. Here we studied the effects of both, when alone and in combination, on honey bee survival and expression changes of immune and detoxification genes. Newly emerged bees were randomly assigned four different treatments: control bees, bees exposed to thiamethoxam, bees exposed to thiamethoxam and then infected with Nosema, and bees infected with N.ceranae only. When combined with Nosema, thiamethoxam caused a significant reduction in survival from the control, but this reduction is not significantly different from N. ceranae alone. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused significantly increased expressions compared to the control for the genes of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptacin, but significantly decreased expression for the defensin gene. When the two factors were combined, the expression patterns were similar to N.ceranae infection alone (apidaecin, defencin and hymenoptaecin), except abaecin, which was increased compared to Nosema infected bees. For detoxification genesCCE8 and CYP315A1, thiamethoxam caused significantly increased gene expression but Nosema caused significantly decreased expression. When combined, the two factors did not show a further increase in Mortality compared to Nosema infection alone.

However, the impacts of parasitic Nosema ceranae to host fitness during long-term pesticide exposure-induced stress is largely unknown. In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to a sublethal dose of dinotefuran, in the presence or absence of N. ceranae, was examined in terms of survival, food consumption, detoxification enzyme activities and gut microbial community. The interaction between dinotefuran and Nosema ceranae on the survival of honey bee was synergistic. Co-exposure to dinotefuran and N. ceranae led to less food consumption and greater changes of enzyme activities involved in defenses against oxidative stress. Particularly, N. ceranae and dinotefuran-N. ceranae co-exposure significantly impacted the gut microbiota structure and richness in adult honey bees, while dinotefuran alone did not show significant alternation of core gut microbiota compared to the control group. We herein demonstrated that chronical exposure to dinotefuran decreases honey bee's survival but is not steadily associated with the gut microbiota dysbiosis; by contrast, N. ceranae parasitism plays a dominant role in the combination in influencing the gut microbial community of the host honey bee.

Due to wild bee sensitivity data shortage, it is unclear if the honey bee Apis mellifera is a suitable surrogate species in the current EU risk assessment scheme. Furthermore, the underlying causes for sensitivity differences in bees are not established. We assessed the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of dimethoate towards multiple bee species, generated a species sensitivity distribution and derived a hazardous dose (HD5). Furthermore, we performed a regression analysis with body weight and dimethoate toxicity. HD5 lower 95% confidence limit was equal to honey bee mean LD50 when applying a safety factor of 10. Body weight proved to be a predictor of interspecific bee sensitivity but did not explain the pattern completely. Using acute toxicity values from honey bees and a safety factor of 10 seems to cover the interspecific sensitivity range of bees in the case of dimethoate. Acute endpoints of proposed additional test species, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris and the red mason bee Osmia bicornis, do not improve the risk assessment for the entire group.

One recurring concern is that the current frameworks may be biased towards assessing risks to the honey bee. This paradigm requires extrapolating toxicity information across bee species. Most research effort has therefore focused on quantifying differences in sensitivity across species. However, our understanding of how responses to pesticides may vary within a species is still very poor. Here we take the first steps towards filling this knowledge gap by comparing acute, lethal hazards in sexes and castes of the eusocial bee Bombus terrestris and in sexes of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis after oral and contact exposure to the pesticides sulfoxaflor, Amistar (azoxystrobin) and glyphosate. We show that sensitivity towards pesticides varies significantly both within and across species. Bee weight was a meaningful predictor of pesticide susceptibility. However, weight could not fully explain the observed differences, which suggests the existence of unexplored mechanisms regulating pesticide sensitivity across bee sexes and castes.

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services. Pesticide risk assessments should include bee species other than honeybees and assess a range of behaviours to elucidate the impact of sublethal effects.

Is Osmia bicornis an adequate regulatory surrogate? Comparing its acute contact sensitivity to Apis mellifera,1039,JOUR,"['Uhl, P', 'Awanbor, O', 'Schulz, RS', 'Brühl, CA']",PLOS ONE,"Bees provide essential ecosystem services and help maintain floral biodiversity. However, there is an ongoing decline of wild and domesticated bee species. Since agricultural pesticide use is a key driver of this process, there is a need for a protective risk assessment. To achieve a more protective registration process, two bee species, Osmia bicornis/Osmia cornuta and Bombus terrestris, were proposed by the European Food Safety Authority as additional test surrogates to the honey bee Apis mellifera. We investigated the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of multiple commercial insecticide formulations towards the red mason bee (O. bicornis) and compared these values to honey bee regulatory endpoints. In two thirds of all cases, O. bicornis was less sensitive than the honey bee. By applying an assessment factor of 10 on the honey bee endpoint, a protective level was achieved for 87% (13 out 15) of all evaluated products. Our results show that O. bicornis is rarely an adequate additional surrogate species for lower tier risk assessment since it is less sensitive than the honey bee for the majority of investigated products. Given the currently limited database on bee species sensitivity, the honey bee seems sufficiently protective in acute scenarios as long as a reasonable assessment factor is applied. However, additional surrogate species can still be relevant for ecologically meaningful higher tier studies.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0201081,14,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Is a strobilurin fungicide capable of inducing histopathological effects on the midgut and Malpighian tubules of honey bees?,73,JOUR,"['Batista, AC', 'Domingues, CED', 'Costa, MJ', 'Silva-Zacarin, ECM']",JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH,"Bees that forage in agricultural plantations and surroundings are exposed to pesticide residues, which can cause sublethal effects in individuals and consequently compromise the performance of the colony. Regarding the honey bees, beekeepers can be hampered by decreased production of honey and other bee products. Although the effects of insecticides on bees are widely studied for obvious reasons, there is growing evidence that fungicides, too, are not harmless to bees. However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees. For this reason, we aimed to perform a histopathological diagnosis and cell death immunolabeling in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Africanized honey bee workers throughout continuous oral exposure (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h) to low concentrations of picoxystrobin (9 ppb and 18 ppb), a strobilurin fungicide. Although there were no histopathological effects on the Malpighian tubules, an organ that plays a role in excretion, these effects were observed in the midgut of bees exposed to both concentrations of picoxystrobin. Morphological alterations, as well as positive-labeling for cell death, were observed in the midgut of exposed bees over time (from 24 to 96 h after the beginning of exposure). Although the data have shown evidence of intestinal epithelial renewal in response to cytotoxic effects, i.e., recovery after short-time exposure, this organ may have its nutrient absorption functions compromised in the long-term, which may lead to symptoms of malnutrition and affect the individual's performance, which could, in turn, affect the whole colony.",2020,10.1080/00218839.2020.1724678,59,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,
Is pollinator visitation of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) influenced by cultivar or pesticide treatment?,180,JOUR,"['Stejskalová, M.', 'Konradyová, V.', 'Suchanová, M.', 'Kazda, J.']",Crop Protection,"Beneficial insects, such as Apis mellifera (honey bees) and Bombus sp. (bumble bees), play important roles in the environment as pollinators, and they are directly affected by agronomical practices, such as pesticide spraying or the selection of crop cultivar. Sunflower is an important resource for these pollinators, and its yield is highly dependent on pollination. Six sunflower hybrid cultivars (ES Biba, Gonzalo, Drake, Vellox, NK Neoma, and P63LE10) were used to compare the visitation rates (VR) of pollinators during flowering in three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). From this set, cultivar P63LE10 was selected to evaluate how pesticide treatments (mixture of two insecticide products containing acetamiprid and pirimicarb, respectively, and two fungicide products containing propiconazole plus prochloraz and dimoxystrobin plus boscalid, respectively) affect pollinator visitation. The amount of pesticide residue in sunflower inflorescences was analyzed to determine the content over the duration of the experiments. The sunflower cultivar P63LE10 was significantly the most attractive to both groups of pollinators in 2017. This cultivar was visited by the highest number of honey bees also in the other years. For bumble bees, cultivar P63LE10, along with cultivars NK Neoma and Vellox, had the highest visitation rates in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, plants treated by the fungicide dimoxystrobin plus boscalid had the highest visitation rates for both groups of pollinators. For bumble bees plants treated with this fungicide were significantly more visited (VR 23.1 ± 2.1%) than these treated with insecticide with pirimicarb (16.4 ± 2%) and the untreated control (17.9 ± 1.7%), and for honey bees plants treated with dimoxystrobin plus boscalid were significantly more visited (VR 24 ± 4.5%) than all other treatments except with acetamiprid (20.5 ± 3.5%). The residues of tested pesticides were found in blooms for the whole time of the experiment (range of values for 2016 and 2017 [ng/g]: acetamiprid 144–6, 3360–56; pirimicarb 177–12, 223–10; prochloraz 380–6, 1970–912; propiconazole 324–17, 1024–1018; boscalid 216–154, 9600–1319; dimoxystrobin 452–137, 6560–911). The influence of cultivar was more important than pesticide treatment in the selection of a preferred food source by pollinators. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.018,114,0.0,1,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Isolation of carboxylesterase (esterase FE4) from Apis cerana cerana and its role in oxidative resistance during adverse environmental stress,275,JOUR,"['Ma, ML', 'Jia, HH', 'Cui, XP', 'Zhai, N', 'Wang, HF', 'Guo, XQ', 'Xu, BH']",BIOCHIMIE,"Carboxylesterases (CarEs) play vital roles in metabolising different physiologically important endogenous compounds and in detoxifying various harmful exogenous compounds in insects. Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples. Together, these data suggest that AcceFE4 may be involved in the oxidative resistance response during adverse stress.

Joint Toxicity of Acetamiprid and Co-Applied Pesticide Adjuvants on Honeybees under Semifield and Laboratory Conditions,29,JOUR,"['Chen, L.', 'Yan, Q.', 'Zhang, J.', 'Yuan, S.', 'Liu, X.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The evaluation of adverse effects of pesticides, pesticide adjuvants, and their combination on honeybees is hampered by a lack of colony-level bioassays reflecting productivity and survival over longer term exposure. In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees. Measures should be taken to manage the environmental risk of pesticide adjuvants during the process of formulation development and registration.

Joint toxic effects of thiamethoxam and flusilazole on the adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),506,JOUR,"['Wang, D.', 'Lv, L.', 'Gao, Z.', 'Zhu, Y.-C.', 'Weng, H.', 'Yang, G.', 'Wang, Y.']",Environmental Pollution,"Insect pollinators are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of many pesticides. However, traditional environmental risk assessment is only carried out based on ecotoxicological data of single substances. In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L−1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L−1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators. Meanwhile, the activities of SOD, caspase 3, caspase 9, and PPO, as well as the expressions of six genes (abaecin, dorsal-2, defensin-2, vtg, caspase-1, and CYP6AS14) associated with oxidative stress, immune response, lifespan, cell apoptosis, and detoxification metabolism were noteworthily varied in the individual and mixture challenges than at the baseline level. These data revealed that it is imminently essential to investigate the combined toxicity of pesticides since the toxicity evaluation from individual compounds toward honey bees may underestimate the toxicity in realistic conditions. Overall, the present results could help understand the potential contribution of pesticide mixtures to the decline of bee populations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120806,317,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Juvenile hormone and transcriptional changes in honey bee worker larvae when exposed to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam,588,JOUR,"['Li, H.', 'Liu, S.', 'Chen, L.', 'Luo, J.', 'Zeng, D.', 'Li, X.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Thiamethoxam, an insecticide with high usage and large amounts of environmental residues, has been reported to affect the pupation and survival of honey bee larvae at sublethal concentrations. The molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we measured the response of juvenile hormone (JH) to environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), monitored the dynamic changes in the transcription of genes encoding major JH metabolic enzymes (CYP15A1, FAMET, JHAMT and JHE) using RT-qPCR, and analysed the transcriptome changes in worker larvae under thiamethoxam stress using RNA-seq. Thiamethoxam significantly increased the levels of JH3 in honey bee larvae, but no significant changes in the transcript levels of the four major metabolic enzymes were observed. Thiamethoxam exposure resulted in 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). P450 CYP6AS5 was upregulated, and some ion-related, odourant-related and gustatory receptors for sugar taste genes were altered significantly. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption were influenced by thiamethoxam. These changes may do harm to honey bee caste differentiation, foraging behaviour related to sensory perception and nutrient levels of bee colonies. These results represent the first assessment of the effects of thiamethoxam on JH in honey bee larvae and provides a new perspective and molecular basis for the study of JH regulation and thiamethoxam toxicity to honey bees. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112744,225,,0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,
LD50 values may be misleading predictors of neonicotinoid toxicity across different bee species,764,JOUR,"['Mayack, C.', 'Boff, S.']",Uludag Aricilik Dergisi,"The importance of not only honey bees (Apis mellifera) but also other non-managed bee species and their pollination services has come to light with their recently reported declines. One contributing factor in these declines is thought to be sub-lethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides such as thiacloprid. However, current government regulatory agencies do not require the assessment of insecticide toxicity on bee species other than the honey bee, even though previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to insecticides is not likely to be generalizable from honey bees to non-managed bee species. Replicating standardized protocols and testing five different doses of thiacloprid on individual caged bees, we assessed the acute contact toxicity by calculating mortality and the lethal dose (LD50) value for three bee species with different life history traits: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis. We found that Apis mellifera and Osmia bicomis had significantly higher mortality in comparison to Bombus terrestris, but there was no dose-dependent response for any of the three bee species. Bee size and sex were also not useful predictors of thiacloprid toxicity. These results suggest that solely relying on LD50 values, especially when they do not produce a dose-dependent response, may be misleading when assessing insecticide toxicity risk for honey bees and other non-managed bee species.

We also tested the pea aphid, Acyrthasiphon pisum (Harris), to calculate selectivity ratios for these beneficial species, which coexist with the aphid pest in Washington State pea and alfalfa ecosystems. Topical toxicity was estimated for all species and ranged 0.0002-0.45 micrograms per insect for diazinon, 0.000031-0.04 micrograms per insect for imidacloprid, and 0.0015-6.11 micrograms per insect for RH-7988. Selectivity ratios based on these values spanned 0.02-47.4, 12.9-1,290.3, and 13.3-4,073 for diazinon, imidacloprid, and RH-7988, respectively. Risk assessment indices based on probit substitution (estimate of mortality of beneficial species at LD(90) for the pest) and 2 standard methods for bees, a sequential testing scheme and a hazard index gave variable predictions of the compatibility of these compounds with integrated pest management. We conclude that predictive methods must advance to consider relative exposure rates to pesticides, aspects of chemical fate, and behavior of the organisms concerned if they are to be useful.

Land-use-associated stressors interact to reduce bumblebee health at the individual and colony level,474,JOUR,"['Straub, F.', 'Birkenbach, M.', 'Leonhardt, S.D.', 'Ruedenauer, F.A.', 'Kuppler, J.', 'Wilfert, L.', 'Ayasse, M.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"In agricultural landscapes, bees face a variety of stressors, including insecticides and poor-quality food. Although both stressors individually have been shown to affect bumblebee health negatively, few studies have focused on stressor interactions, a scenario expected in intensively used agricultural landscapes. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, a key pollinator in agricultural landscapes, we conducted a fully factorial laboratory experiment starting at nest initiation. We assessed the effects of food quality and insecticides, alone and in interaction, on health traits at various levels, some of which have been rarely studied. Pollen with a diluted nutrient content (low quality) reduced ovary size and delayed colony development. Wing asymmetry, indicating developmental stress, was increased during insecticide exposure and interactions with poor food, whereas both stressors reduced body size. Both stressors and their interaction changed the workers' chemical profile and reduced worker interactions and the immune response. Our findings suggest that insecticides combined with nutritional stress reduce bumblebee health at the individual and colony levels, thus possibly affecting colony performance, such as development and reproduction, and the stability of plant-pollinator networks. The synergistic effects highlight the need of combining stressors in risk assessments and when studying the complex effects of anthropogenic stressors on health outcomes.  © 2023 The Authors.",2023,10.1098/rspb.2023.1322,290,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,

Such crops represent an important source of forage for bees, which is often scarce in agro-ecosystems. However, this benefit has often been overlooked in the design of previous field studies, leaving the net impact of neonicotinoid treated crops on bees relatively unknown. Here, we determine the combined benefit (forage) and cost (insecticide) of oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds on Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera colonies. In April 2014, 36 colonies per species were located adjacent to three large oilseed rape fields (12 colonies per field). Another 36 were in three nearby locations in the same agro-ecosystem, but several kilometers distant from any oilseed rape fields. We found that Bombus colony growth and reproduction were unaffected by location (distant versus adjacent) following the two month flowering period. Apis colony and queen survival were unaffected. However, there was a small, but significant, negative relationship between honey and pollen neonicotinoid contamination and Apis colony weight gain. We hypothesize that any sublethal effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on Bombus colonies are potentially offset by the additional foraging resources provided. A better understanding of the ecological and agronomic factors underlying neonicotinoid residues is needed to inform evidence-based policy. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",2017,10.1021/acs.est.7b02236,51,0.0,1,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,

Many aspects have to be considered to avoid confounding effects which is probably the reason why they are not regularly performed in the context of risk assessments of plant protection products to pollinating insects. However, if conducted appropriately their contribution is most valuable. In this paper we identify the requirements of a large-scale monitoring study for the assessment of side-effects of clothianidin seed-treated winter oilseed rape on three species of pollinating insects (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) and present how these requirements were implemented. Two circular study sites were delineated next to each other in northeast Germany and comprised almost 65 km2 each. At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado®). The comparison of environmental conditions at the study sites indicated that they are as similar as possible in terms of climate, soil, land use, history and current practice of agriculture as well as in availability of oilseed rape and non-crop bee forage. Accordingly, local environmental conditions were considered not to have had any confounding effect on the results of the monitoring of the bee species. Furthermore, the study area was found to be representative for other oilseed rape cultivation regions in Europe. © 2016, The Author(s).",2016,10.1007/s10646-016-1724-9,25,0.0,1,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

At each site, three locations were directly adjacent to oilseed rape fields and three locations were situated 400 m away from the nearest oilseed rape field. Thus, 96 hives were exposed to fully flowering oilseed rape crops. Colony sizes and weights, the amount of honey harvested, and infection with parasites and diseases were monitored between April and September 2014.

Tank mixtures are often common practice by farmers, and mostly their effects on honey bees are not routinely assessed. To enable a realistic assessment of laboratory-reported effects of a combination of the insecticide thiacloprid and fungicide prochloraz on honey bees, a large-scale field study with spray application in winter oilseed rape was conducted in four regions in Germany. Several parameters were investigated, including mortality, flight activity, and colony development. Residue analysis of various materials (e.g., dead bees, nectar, and pollen) was conducted to assess exposure level. We observed several intoxication symptoms 2 h after application, including a high number of moribund bees and dead bees on the first day after application (DAA +1) compared to the control. Adverse effects were observed on the number of open brood cells, with a significant reduction of approximately 22% compared to control over the experimental period. High residue concentrations were detected on flowers and dead bees on the day of application, which decreased rapidly within six days. The residue concentrations detected were higher in bee-collected materials than in materials stored in the hive. In conclusion, exposure to a combination containing thiacloprid-prochloraz poses a high risk to honey bees.

Larval Pollen stress increases adult susceptibility to clothianidin in honey bees,766,JOUR,"['Mogren, C.L.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.B.']",Insects,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under scrutiny for their potential role in honey bee declines. Additionally, reduced access to forage in agricultural areas creates the potential for risk interactions with these pesticides in regions critical for honey production. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient access to pollen during larval development could mitigate stress associated with oral clothianidin exposure in honey bee adults. An apiary was established where pollen traps deprived half of the colonies of pollen, which was then supplemented to the others. Adults were fed 0, 10, 40, 200, or 400 µg/L clothianidin in the laboratory, and larval and adult lipids and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared between feeding treatments. Survival at sublethal concentrations of clothianidin was significantly reduced for adult bees reared in pollen deprived colonies. Adult SOD activity was affected by clothianidin dose but not larval feeding treatment, though within the pollen-deprived cohort, SOD was greater in controls than those fed clothianidin. Larval SOD differed between field replicates, with supplemented colonies having slightly higher activity levels during a period of pollen dearth, indicating that supplementation during these periods is particularly important for mitigating oxidative stress within the hive. Larval lipids were significantly higher in supplemented colonies during a substantial pollen flow, though adult lipids were unaffected by feeding treatment. These results suggest that during periods of pollen dearth, oxidative stress and adult worker longevity will be improved by supplementing colonies with locally collected pollen. © 2019 by the authors.

"Larval exposure to field-realistic concentrations of clothianidin has no effect on development rate, over-winter survival or adult metabolic rate in a solitary bee, Osmia bicornis",864,JOUR,"['Nicholls, E.', 'Fowler, R.', 'Niven, J.E.', 'Gilbert, J.D.', 'Goulson, D.']",PeerJ,"There is widespread concern regarding the effects of agro-chemical exposure on bee health, of which neonicotinoids, systemic insecticides detected in the pollen and nectar of both crops and wildflowers, have been the most strongly debated. The majority of studies examining the effect of neonicotinoids on bees have focussed on social species, namely honey bees and bumble bees. However, most bee species are solitary, their life histories differing considerably from these social species, and thus it is possible that their susceptibility to pesticides may be quite different. Studies that have included solitary bees have produced mixed results regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on survival and reproductive success. While the majority of studies have focused on the effects of adult exposure, bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here we examined the effect of exposure of Osmia bicornis larvae to a range of field-realistic concentrations (0-10 ppb) of the neonicotinoid clothianidin, observing no effect on larval development time, overwintering survival or adult weight. Flow-through respirometry was used to test for latent effects of larval exposure on adult physiological function. We observed differences between male and female bees in the propensity to engage in discontinuous gas exchange; however, no effect of larval clothianidin exposure was observed. Our results suggest that previously reported adverse effects of neonicotinoids on O. bicornis are most likely mediated by impacts on adults. © 2017 Nicholls et al.",2017,10.7717/peerj.3417,2017,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,

However, the present work provides the first evidence of impaired learning and memory in adult bees that were fed thiamethoxam (0.6 ng/bee) during the larval stage. We also show no alterations in learning and memory in bees after infection with American foulbrood at the larval stage. The present study contributes to our knowledge of the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee larvae and adults. © 2017 International Bee Research Association.",2017,10.1080/00218839.2017.1332541,56,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

In case pesticide exposure to bees is likely, toxicity tests are performed with honey bees (Apis mellifera), with a tiered approach, for which validated and internationally accepted test protocols exist. However, concerns have grown regarding the protection of non-Apis bees [bumble bees (Bombus spp.), solitary and stingless bees], given their different life cycles and therefore distinct exposure routes. Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient. In addition, new insights needed to develop a standardized test protocol were acquired, such as testing of a positive control for the first time and selection of male and female individuals at egg level. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112143,215,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

These chemical compounds reach the hive through forager bees, and once there, they can be ingested by the larvae. We evaluated the effects of repeated larval exposure to neonicotinoid insecticide, both in isolation and in combination with strobilurin fungicide, at environmentally relevant doses. The total consumption of the contaminated diet was 23.63 ng fungicide/larvae (pyraclostrobin) and 0.2364 ng insecticide/larvae (clothianidin). The effects on post-embryonic development were evaluated over time. Additionally, we assessed the survival pattern of worker bees after emergence, and the pesticides’ effects on the behavior of newly emerged workers and young workers. Young bees that were exposed to the fungicide and those subjected to co-exposure to both pesticides during larval phase showed behavioral changes. The insecticide, both in isolation and in combination with fungicide reduced the bees’ longevity; this effect of larval exposure to pesticides was stronger in bees that were exposed only to the insecticide. Although the larvae did not have sensitivity to exposure to pesticides, they showed later effects after emergence, which may compromise the dynamics of the colony, contributing to the reduction of the populations of bees in agroecosystems. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,10.1038/s41598-019-39383-z,9,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

The latter showed a 48-h oral LD50 value (153ng per bee) five times higher than that of imidacloprid (30ng per bee). Chronic feeding tests indicated that the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) of imidacloprid and of 5-OH-imidacloprid on mortality of winter bees were 24 and 120 μg kg-1 respectively. Behavioural effects of imidacloprid and 5-OH-imidacloprid were studied using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension response at two periods of the year. Winter bees surviving chronic treatment with imidacloprid and 5-OH-imidacloprid had reduced learning performances. The LOEC of imidacloprid was lower in summer bees (12 μg kg-1) than in winter bees (48 μg kg-1), which points to a greater sensitivity of honeybees behaviour in summer bees, compared to winter bees. © 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.",2003,10.1002/ps.631,59,,0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,
Lethal and sub-lethal effects of spinosad on bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson),1005,JOUR,"['Morandin, L.A.', 'Winston, M.L.', 'Franklin, M.T.', 'Abbott, V.A.']",Pest Management Science,"Recent developments of new families of pesticides and growing awareness of the importance of wild pollinators for crop pollination have stimulated interest in potential effects of novel pesticides on wild bees. Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control, 0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg-1, during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment. At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild (0.2-0.8 mg kg-1) we detected minimal negative effects to bumble bee colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at 8.0 mg kg-1 spinosad, about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a 'worst case' field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg-1 were slower foragers on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad treated colonies. Inclusion of similar sub-lethal assays to detect effects of pesticides on pollinators would aid in development of environmentally responsible pest management strategies. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005,10.1002/ps.1058,61,,0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,

We also made progress toward developing reliable methodology for testing pesticides on wild bees for use in pesticide registration by using field and laboratory experiments. Bee larvae were exposed to control, low (3 or 6 ppb), intermediate (30 ppb), or high (300 ppb) doses of either imidacloprid or clothianidin in pollen. Field experiments on both bee species involved injecting the pollen provisions with the corresponding pesticide. Only O. lignaria was used for the laboratory experiments, which entailed both injecting the bee's own pollen provisions and replacing the pollen provision with a preblended pollen mixture containing imidacloprid. Larval development, emergence, weight, and mortality were monitored and analyzed. There were no lethal effects found for either imidacloprid or clothianidin on O. lignaria and M. rotundata. Minor sublethal effects were detected on larval development for O. lignaria, with greater developmental time at the intermediate (30 ppb) and high doses (300 ppb) of imidacloprid. No similar sublethal effects were found with clothianidin on M. rotundata. We were successful in creating methodology for pesticide testing on O. lignaria and M. rotundata; however, these methods can be improved upon to create a more robust test. We also identified several parameters and developmental stages for observing sublethal effects.

Because insecticides are used during bloom to manage insect pests, bumble bees may be at risk of exposure. We therefore assessed the susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life span, and reproduction. The highest concentration of deltamethrin (17 mg a.i./L) reduced feeding. Workers treated with deltamethrin had shortened life spans and produced fewer males. Flubendiamide (2000 mg a.i./L) and spinetoram (0.8 mg a.i./L) caused no sublethal effects.

In recent years, neonicotinoids are widely used against a broad spectrum sucking pests. However, they also pose a major threat to the beekeeping industry. The present study aimed to quantify the impact of thiamethoxam, a second-generation, broad-spectrum neonicotinoid on foraging behavior, colony performance, and survival of Apis mellifera L. in mustard crop under semi-field (cage) and field conditions. Under semi-field conditions, the foraging activity of A. mellifera on mustard bloom reduced significantly on the 2nd day after spray of thiamethoxam as compared to pre-count and control. Significant decrease in brood area (7th to 21st day), nectar stores (7th to 28th day), and pollen stores (7th to 21st day) were also recorded after the spray. The bee mortality under semi-field conditions was significantly higher on the 1st and 2nd day after spray in comparison to control. Under field conditions, average bee activity remained statistically low up to the 12th day after spray on mustard bloom in comparison to pre-count and control. The effect of thiamethoxam under field conditions was less pronounced for bee mortality and colony parameters. Based on LD50, thiamethoxam was proved toxic to adults and larvae of A. mellifera. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2022,10.1007/s11356-021-16426-5,29,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Lethal and sublethal side-effect assessment supports a more benign profile of spinetoram compared with spinosad in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris,990,JOUR,"['Besard, L.', 'Mommaerts, V.', 'Abdu-Alla, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to identify the potential side effects of the novel naturalyte insecticide spinetoram in comparison with spinosad on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. The potential lethal effects together with the ecologically relevant sublethal effects on aspects of bumblebee reproduction and foraging behaviour were evaluated. Bumblebee workers were exposed via direct contact with wet and dry residues under laboratory conditions to spinetoram at different concentrations, starting from the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) and then different dilutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10 000 of the MFRC), and compared with spinosad. In addition, the side effects via oral exposure in supplemented sugar water were assessed. RESULTS: Direct contact of B. terrestris workers with wet residues of spinosad and spinetoram showed spinetoram to be approximately 52 times less toxic than spinosad, while exposure to dry residues of spinetoram was about 8 times less toxic than exposure to those of spinosad. Oral treatment for 72 h (acute) indicated that spinetoram is about 4 times less toxic to B. terrestris workers compared with spinosad, while exposure for a longer period (i.e. 11 weeks) showed spinetoram to be 24 times less toxic. In addition, oral exposure to the two spinosyns resulted in detrimental sublethal effects on bumblebee reproduction. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for spinosad was 1/1000 of the MFRC, and 1/100 of the MFRC for spinetoram. Comparison between the chronic exposure bioassays assessing the sublethal effects on nest reproduction, with and without allowing for foraging behaviour, showed that the respective NOEC values for spinosad and spinetoram were similar over the two bioassays, indicating that there were no adverse effects by either spinosyn on the foraging of B. terrestris workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results indicate that the use of spinetoram is safer for bumblebees by direct contact and oral exposure than the use of spinosad, and therefore it can be applied safely in combination with B. terrestris. Another important conclusion is that the present data provide strong evidence that neither spinosyn has a negative effect on the foraging behaviour of these beneficial insects. However, before drawing final conclusions, spinetoram and spinosad should also be evaluated in more realistic field-related situations for the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour with the use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",2011,10.1002/ps.2093,67,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

The effects of mixtures of heavy metals and pesticides are rarely studied in bees, even though bees are likely to be exposed to these contaminants in both agricultural and urban environments. In this study, the lethal toxicity of Cr alone and in combination with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin and the ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide propiconazole was assessed in Apis mellifera adults. The LD50 and lowest benchmark dose of Cr as Cr(NO3)3, revealed a low acute oral toxicity on honey bee foragers (2049 and 379 mg L−1, respectively) and the Cr retention (i.e. bee ability to retain the heavy metal in the body) was generally low compared to other metals. A modified method based on the binomial proportion test was developed to analyse synergistic and antagonistic interactions between the three tested contaminants. The combination of an ecologically-relevant field concentration of chromium with clothianidin and propiconazole did not increase bee mortality. On the contrary, the presence of Cr in mixture with propiconazole elicited a slight antagonistic effect. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.10.068,191,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Long-term dynamics of honey bee colonies following exposure to chemical stress,749,JOUR,"['Colin, T.', 'Meikle, W.G.', 'Paten, A.M.', 'Barron, A.B.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Pesticide residues have been linked to reduced bee health and increased honey bee colony failure. Most research to date has investigated the role of pesticides on individual honey bees, and it is still unclear how trace levels of pesticides change colony viability and productivity over seasonal time scales. To address this question we exposed standard bee colonies to chemical stressors known to have negative effects on individual bees, and measured the productivity of bee colonies across a whole year in two environments: near Tucson Arizona and Sydney Australia. We exposed hives to a trace amount of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and to the acaricide thymol, and measured capped brood, bee and honey production, as well as the temperature and foraging force of the colonies. The effect of imidacloprid on colony dynamics differed between the two environments. In Tucson we recorded a positive effect of imidacloprid treatment on bee and brood numbers. Thymol was associated with short-term negative effects on bee numbers at both locations, and may have affected colony survival at one location. The overall benefits of thymol for the colonies were unclear. We conclude that long-term and colony-level measures of the effects of agrochemicals are needed to properly understand risks to bees. © 2019",2019,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.402,677,,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,

However, little is known about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.",2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0506,285,,0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Low doses of neonicotinoid pesticides in food rewards impair short-term olfactory memory in foraging-age honeybees,286,JOUR,"['Wright, GA', 'Softley, S', 'Earnshaw, H']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Neonicotinoids are often applied as systemic seed treatments to crops and have reported negative impact on pollinators when they appear in floral nectar and pollen. Recently, we found that bees in a two-choice assay prefer to consume solutions containing field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiamethoxam (TMX), to sucrose alone. This suggests that neonicotinoids enhance the rewarding properties of sucrose and that low, acute doses could improve learning and memory in bees. To test this, we trained foraging-age honeybees to learn to associate floral scent with a reward containing nectar-relevant concentrations of IMD and TMX and tested their short (STM) and long-term (LTM) olfactory memories. Contrary to our predictions, we found that none of the solutions enhanced the rate of olfactory learning and some of them impaired it. In particular, the effect of 10 nM IMD was observed by the second conditioning trial and persisted 24 h later. In most other groups, exposure to IMD and TMX affected STM but not LTM. Our data show that negative impacts of low doses of IMD and TMX do not require long-term exposure and suggest that impacts of neonicotinoids on olfaction are greater than their effects on rewarding memories.",2015,10.1038/srep15322,5,,0,0.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (LC50/100: 0.014651 ng imidacloprid mu L-1 diet) on the distribution of certain proteins identified in the brain of Apis mellifera worker bees using a MALDI-imaging approach. This technique enables proteomic analysis of tissues in situ by monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biochemical processes occurring at a specific time in specific brain neuropils. For this purpose, foraging bees were exposed to an 8-day diet containing a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid corresponding to the LC50/100. Bees were collected on day 8 of exposure, and their brains analyzed using protein density maps. RESULTS The results showed that exposure to imidacloprid led to a series of biochemical changes, including alterations in synapse regulation, apoptosis regulation and oxidative stress, which may adversely impair the physiology of these colony bees. CONCLUSION Worker bee contact with even tiny amounts of imidacloprid had potent effects leading to the overexpression of a series of proteins related to important cellular processes that were possibly damaged by the insecticide.

Managing nuclei in insect-proof tunnel as an observation tool for foraging bees : sublethal effects of deltamethrin and imidacloprid,1044,CONF,"['Colin, ME', 'Le Conte, Y', 'Vermandere, JP']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES,"A 8 x 20 m insect-proof tunnel is used to separate the experimental bees from those of the nearby colonies and to make certain of their food source. Nuclei enclosing one-fourth Dadant frame, are made with Plexiglas sides allowing a complete observation of the insects. After the nuclei are filled with pollen, brood and 1,000 adult bees, foraging bees are trained to visit a feeding station placed at the center of the tunnel, which means a 10 m distance from the entrance of the nuclei. The day-time of the disposal of the sugar solution is to be strictly regarded. When the foragers are well trained to forage a sucrose solution, a contaminated one is offered the following days. Criteria of observation can be (i) the foragers recruitment, (ii) the number of feeding bees and their behaviour at the feeder, (iii) the return flights, (iv) the trophallaxis inside the nucleus. Such a protocol has been put into practice to demonstrate the alteration of the homing flight in bees exposed to sublethal doses of deltamethrin (Vandame et al., 1995). Since, it has been improved and revealed some features of the toxicity of imidacloprid at sublethal doses.",2001,,,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Measuring foraging preferences in bumble bees: a comparison of popular laboratory methods and a test for sucrose preferences following neonicotinoid exposure,638,JOUR,"['Richman, S.K.', 'Muth, F.', 'Leonard, A.S.']",Oecologia,"Animals develop food preferences based on taste, nutritional quality and to avoid environmental toxins. Yet, measuring preferences in an experimental setting can be challenging since ecologically realistic assays can be time consuming, while simplified assays may not capture natural sampling behavior. Field realism is a particular challenge when studying behavioral responses to environmental toxins in lab-based assays, given that toxins can themselves impact sampling behavior, masking our ability to detect preferences. We address these challenges by comparing different experimental methods for measuring sucrose concentration preference in bumble bees (Bombus impatiens), evaluating the utility of two preference chamber-based methods (ad libitum versus a novel restricted-sampling assay) in replicating bees’ preferences when they fly freely between artificial flowers in a foraging arena. We find that the restricted-sampling method matched a free-flying scenario more closely than the ad libitum protocol, and we advocate for expanded use of this approach, given its ease of implementation. We then performed a second experiment using the new protocol to ask whether consuming the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid, known to suppress feeding motivation, interfered with the expression of sucrose preferences. After consuming imidacloprid, bees were less likely to choose the higher-quality sucrose even as they gained experience with both options. Thus, we provide evidence that pesticides interfere with bees’ ability to discriminate between floral rewards that differ in value. This work highlights a simple protocol for assessing realistic foraging preferences in bees and provides an efficient way for researchers to measure the impacts of anthropogenic factors on preference expression. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,10.1007/s00442-021-04979-8,196,,0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
"Mechanism for the differential toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides in the honey bee, Apis mellifera",1015,JOUR,"['Iwasa, T.', 'Motoyama, N.', 'Ambrose, J.T.', 'Roe, R.M.']",Crop Protection,"Laboratory bioassays were conducted to determine the contact honey bee toxicity of commercial and candidate neonicotinoid insecticides. The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with LD50 values of 18ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22ng for clothianidin, 30ng for thiamethoxam, 75ng for dinotefuran and 138ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with LD50 values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6μg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50μg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees. When honey bees were placed in cages in forced contact with alfalfa treated with acetamiprid and the synergist, triflumizole, in combination at their maximum recommended application rates, no mortality was detected above that of the control. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

An in silico study was conducted to investigate the various metabolism of imidacloprid and thiacloprid. The binding potency of thiacloprid was stronger and a stable π-π interaction with Phe121 and the N–H⋯N hydrogen bond with Asn214 are found in the CYP9Q3-thiacloprid system but absent in imidacloprid, which might affect the potential metabolic activity. Moreover, the values of highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy and the vertical ionization potential (IP) of two compounds demonstrated that thiacloprid is more likely to oxidation. The findings revealed the probable binding modes of imidacloprid and thiacloprid with CYP9Q3 and might facilitate future design of the low bee toxicity neonicotinoid insecticides. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022,10.1016/j.jmgm.2022.108257,116,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

Melatonin enhances the antioxidant capacity to rescue the honey bee Apis mellifera from the ecotoxicological effects caused by environmental imidacloprid,569,JOUR,"['Li, Z.', 'Duan, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Qin, Q.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees. Melatonin secretion may be a defense mechanism to mitigate imidacloprid toxicity. © 2022 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113622,239,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Metabolic profiling of Apis mellifera larvae treated with sublethal acetamiprid doses,498,JOUR,"['Shi, X.', 'Shi, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Wu, X.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Acetamiprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide used in crop protection worldwide. Such widespread application can pose risks to pollinator insects, particularly to honeybees (Apis mellifera); therefore, the evaluation of the harmful effects of acetamiprid is necessary. Recent studies report behavior and gene expression dysfunction in honeybees, related to acetamiprid contamination. However, most studies do not consider potential metabolism disorders. To examine the effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on the hemolymph metabolism of honeybees, worker bee larvae(2 days old) were fed with sucrose water containing different concentrations of acetamiprid (0, 5, and 25 mg/L) until capped (6 days old). The hemolymph (200 μL) of freshly capped larvae was collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall, increasing acetamiprid exposure induced greater metabolic variations in worker bee larvae(treated groups compared to untreated). In the positive ion mode, 36 common differential metabolites in the acetamiprid-treated groups were screened from the identified differential metabolites. Of these, 19 metabolites were upregulated, and 17 were downregulated. 10 common differential metabolites were screened in the negative ion mode. 3 metabolites were upregulated, and 7 metabolites were downregulated. These common metabolites included traumatic acid, indole etc. These commonly differentiated metabolites were classified as compounds with biological roles, lipids, and phytochemical compounds, and others. The metabolic pathways of common differentiated metabolites with significant differences (P < 0.05) included the metabolism of tryptophan, purines, phenylalanine, etc. As the concentration of acetamiprid increased, the content of traumatic acid increased, the content of tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine and indole decreased, and the content of lipids also decreased. Our results revealed that the damage to honeybee larvae increased when the acetamiprid solution formulations residue in their food had a concentration higher than 5 mg/L, causing metabolic disorders in various substances in larvae. Analysis of these metabolic processes can provide a theoretical basis for further research on the metabolism of acetamiprid-treated honeybees and elucidate the detoxification mechanisms. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114716,254,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Metabolisation of thiamethoxam (a neonicotinoid pesticide) and interaction with the Chronic bee paralysis virus in honeybees,834,JOUR,"['Coulon, M.', 'Schurr, F.', 'Martel, A.-C.', 'Cougoule, N.', 'Bégaud, A.', 'Mangoni, P.', 'Dalmon, A.', 'Alaux, C.', 'Le Conte, Y.', 'Thiéry, R.', 'Ribière-Chabert, M.', 'Dubois, E.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Pathogens and pesticides are likely to co-occur in honeybee hives, but much remains to be investigated regarding their potential interactions. Here, we first investigated the metabolisation kinetics of thiamethoxam in chronically fed honeybees. We show that thiamethoxam, at a dose of 0.25 ng/bee/day, is quickly and effectively metabolised into clothianidin, throughout a 20 day exposure period. Using a similar chronic exposure to pesticide, we then studied, in a separate experiment, the impact of thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) co-exposure in honeybees. The honeybees were exposed to the virus by contact, mimicking the natural transmission route in the hive. We demonstrate that a high dose of thiamethoxam (5.0 ng/bee/day) can cause a synergistic increase in mortality in co-exposed honeybees after 8 to 10 days of exposure, with no increase in viral loads. At a lower dose (2.5 ng/bee/day), there was no synergistic increase of mortality, but viral loads were significantly higher in naturally dead honeybees, compared with sacrificed honeybees exposed to the same conditions. These results show that the interactions between pathogens and pesticides in honeybees can be complex: increasing pesticide doses may not necessarily be linked to a rise in viral loads, suggesting that honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might change with pesticide exposure. © 2017 The Authors",2018,10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.10.009,144,,0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

However, it also simultaneously has adverse effects on the health of important pollinators, such as honey bees. Previous studies have reported that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impaired immunocompetence, learning and memory performance, and homing behaviour in honey bees. In the present study, using LC-MS-based combined with GC–MS-based metabolomic approaches, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the head of honey bee after subchronic exposure to 2 mg/L thiacloprid over 3 days. The estimated total dose of thiacloprid fed to each bee was 0.12 μg. The results showed that there were 115 metabolites significantly affected in thiacloprid-treated bees compared to control. The metabolites with high level of abundance enriched to wide range pathways associated with oxidative stress and detoxification suggest that the honey bees have activated their detoxification system to resistant toxicity of thiacloprid. While, the reduction of serotonin suggest thiacloprid may hinder the brain activity implicated in learning and behaviour development.

Currently, the number of pollinators is decreasing worldwide, which is attributed mostly to the widespread use of pesticides. The aim of this work was to develop a method for assessing the genotoxicity of pesticides for the Bombus terrestris L. bumblebee using long-range PCR of mitochondrial DNA fragments. We have developed a panel of primers and assessed the genotoxicity of the following pesticides: imidacloprid, rotenone, deltamethrin, difenocanozole, malathion, metribuzin, penconazole, esfenvalerate, and dithianon. All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA. The mtDNA damage was observed for all studied pesticides. Most of the studied pesticides caused significant damage to mtDNA in vitro and in vivo when ingested. Our results indicate that all tested pesticides, including herbicides and fungicides, can have a toxic effect on pollinators. However, the extent of pesticide-induced mtDNA damage in the flight muscles was significantly less upon the contact compared to the oral administration. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104675,169,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Here we report our recent investigation on how imidacloprid, one of the major neonicotinoids, affects worker bees by profiling the transcriptomes of various ages of bees exposed to different doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage. The results show that imidacloprid treatments during the larval stage severely altered the gene expression profiles and may induce precocious foraging. Differential expression of foraging regulators was found in 14-day-old treated adults. A high transcriptome similarity between larvae-treated 14-day-old adults and 20-day-old controls was also observed, and the similarity was positively correlated with the dose of imidacloprid. One parts per billion (ppb) of imidacloprid was sufficient to generate a long-term impact on the bee’s gene expression as severe as with 50 ppb imidacloprid.

It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L−1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L−1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP.

In the present work, in silico tools, such as molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict if environmental chemicals have stronger binding affinities to honey bee antennal odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) than the representative floral odors citralva, eugenol, and the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine. Based on structural analysis, 21 chemicals from crop pesticides, household appliances, cosmetics, food, public health-related products, and other sources, many of which are pervasive in the hive environment, have higher binding affinities than the floral odors. These results suggest that chemical exposures are likely to interfere with the honey bee's sense of smell and this disruptive mechanism may be responsible for the lower associative learning and memory based on olfaction found in bees exposed to pesticides. Moreover, bees mainly rely on olfactory cues to perceive their environment and orient themselves as well as to discriminate and identify their food, predators, nestmates, and diseased individuals that need to be removed with hygienic behavior. In summary, sub-lethal exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to colony collapse in several ways from the disruption of proper olfaction functioning.",2023,10.1002/jmr.3008,36,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Modified neonicotinoid insecticide with bi-directional selective toxicity and drug resistance,299,JOUR,"['Zhao, Y.', 'Li, Y.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"A three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model was established based on the molecular structures and the negative logarithm of experimental lethal concentration 50 values (pLC50) of neonicotinoid insecticides. Then, the mechanisms of bi-directional selective toxic effects and drug resistance were determined using homology modeling and molecular docking analyses. The results of the model showed that the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 12- positions of neonicotinoid insecticides strongly affected their toxicity, and that the introduction of bulky or electropositive groups at these positions could increase the pLC50 values. Using Compound 19 as a template, we designed 37 derivatives with greater toxicity (increased by 0.04–11.45%). Among them, 20 derivatives had bioconcentrations lower than that of Compound 19 (reduced by 0.38–147.88%). Further screening of Compound 19 and the 20 derivatives mentioned above by homology modeling and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) molecular docking analyses showed that 10 derivatives had bi-directional selective toxic effects against pests and bees. Further docking analyses of Compound 19 and these 10 derivatives identified that Derivative-33 showed decreased docking with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S transferase (GST) in pests and enhanced docking with these enzymes in bees, indicating bi-directional selective resistance for pests and bees. Accordingly, Derivative-33 was selected as a new insecticide with high toxicity to pests and low toxicity to bees (bi-directional selective toxicity), low resistance in pest populations, and high resistance in bee populations. This study provides valuable reference data and will be useful for the development of strategies to produce new environmentally friendly pesticides. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.08.055,164,,0,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Thus, we investigated the agonist actions of neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin) on A. mellifera α1 (Amα1)/chicken β2 hybrid nAChRs in Xenopus laevis oocytes according to the subunit stoichiometry of (Amα1)3(β2)2 and (Amα1)2(β2)3 using voltage-clamp electrophysiology. ACh activated (Amα1)3(β2)2 and (Amα1)2(β2)3 nAChRs with similar current amplitude. We investigated the agonist activity of imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin for the two hybrid nAChRs and found that: 1) imidacloprid showed higher affinity than clothianidin, whereas clothianidin showed higher efficacy than imidacloprid for the nAChRs; 2) Thiacloprid showed the highest agonist affinity and the lowest efficacy for the nAChRs. The Amα1/β2 subunit ratio influenced the efficacy of imidacloprid and thiacloprid, but hardly affected that of clothianidin. Hydrogen bond formation by the NH group in clothianidin with the main chain carbonyl of the loop B may account, at least in part, for the unique agonist actions of clothianidin on the hybrid nAChRs tested. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.02.011,166,,0,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Molecular Effects of Neonicotinoids in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),888,JOUR,"['Christen, V.', 'Mittner, F.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

However, little is known about whether OBPs perform other functions in insects, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. Within this study, an OBP gene (AccOBP10) was isolated and identified from A. c. cerana. Both homology and phylogenetic relationship analyses indicated that the amino acid sequence of AccOBP10 had a high degree of sequence identity with other members of the gene family. Analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that AccOBP10 mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the venom gland than in other tissues. The mRNA transcript expression of AccOBP10 was upregulated by low temperature (4 degrees C), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), pyridaben, methomyl and imidacloprid but downregulated by heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet light, vitamin C, mercuric chloride, cadmium chloride, paraquat and phoxim. Expression of AccOBP10 under abiotic stress was analysed by western blotting, and the results were consistent with those of qRT-PCR. And as a further study of AccOBP10 function, we demonstrated that knockdown of AccOBP10 by RNA interference could slightly increase the expression levels of some stress-related genes.

In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a member of the alpha-crystallin/sHSP family, termed AccHsp27.6, was isolated from Apis cerana cerana. The full-length cDNA is 1,014 bp in length and contains a 708-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.53. Seven putative heat shock elements and three NF-kappa B binding sites were present in the 5'-flanking region, suggesting a possible function in immunity. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that AccHsp27.6 was expressed in all tested tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, expression of the AccHsp27.6 transcript was induced by exposure to heat shock, H2O2, a number of different chemicals (including SO2, formaldehyde, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and the pesticides phoxime and acetamiprid), and the microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, the mRNA expression could be repressed by CO2, the pesticides pyriproxyfen and cyhalothrin, and the microbes Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Its flowers constitute important sources for bees and beekeepers take advantage of this and keep their honey bee colonies within or near the plantations for honey production. Nonetheless, these plantations are susceptible to pests, such as the eucalyptus weevil Gonipterus platensis. To control this weevil, some plantations must be treated with pesticides, which might harm non-target organisms. This study aimed to perform a multifactorial assessment of the health status and development of Apis mellifera iberiensis colonies in two similar landscape windows dominated by Eucalyptus globulus plantations - one used as control and the other with insecticide treatment. In each of the two selected areas, an apiary with five hives was installed and monitored before and after a single application of the insecticide acetamiprid (40 g a.i./ha). Colony health and development, resources use, and pesticide residues accumulation were measured. The results showed that the application of acetamiprid in this area did not alter the health status and development of the colonies. This can be explained by the low levels of residues of acetamiprid detected only in pollen and bee bread samples, ~52 fold lower than the sublethal effect threshold. This could be attributed to the low offer of resources during and after the application event and within the application area, with the consequent foraging outside the sprayed area during that period. Since exposure to pesticides in such complex landscapes seems to be dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources, we highlight some key monitoring parameters and tools that are able to provide reliable information on colony development and use of resources. These tools can be easily applied and can provide a better decision-taking of pesticide application in intensive production systems to decrease the risk of exposure for honey bees. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157030,844,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

Colony development was evaluated by monitoring the colony mass, forager activity was assessed, both at the hive and within the crop, and the contribution of oilseed rape to the pollen stored within the colony was analysed. ResultsPollen collected from the treated crop contained residues of 1.0 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and 3.0 mu g CGA322704 (metabolite likely equivalent to clothiandin) kg(-1), and nectar contained residues of 1.8 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and no metabolite. No residues of thiamethoxam or CGA322704 were detected in samples from the control fields. Up to 93% of bumblebee collected pollen sampled from within the colonies originated from oilseed rape, and B. terrestris were observed actively foraging on all the fields. Colonies on all three fields showed similar rates of mass gain during the exposure phase and comparable production of gynes and drones.

In the present study, the effects of chronic FPF exposure on bees were systematically investigated at the individual behavioral, tissue, cell, enzyme activity, and the gene expression levels. Chronic exposure (14 d) to FPF led to reduced survival (12 mg/L), body weight gain (4 and 12 mg/L), and food utilization efficiency (4 and 12 mg/L). Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis. FPF exposure (4 and 12 mg/L) led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activity. Notably, gene expression analysis indicated significant dysregulation of apoptosis, immune, detoxification, sucrose responsiveness and memory-related genes, suggesting the involvement of different pathways in FPF-induced toxicity.

Multiple stressors interact to impair the performance of bumblebee Bombus terrestris colonies,668,JOUR,"['Botías, C.', 'Jones, J.C.', 'Pamminger, T.', 'Bartomeus, I.', 'Hughes, W.O.H.', 'Goulson, D.']",Journal of Animal Ecology,"Bumblebees are constantly exposed to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses which they must defend themselves against to survive. Pathogens and pesticides represent important stressors that influence bumblebee health, both when acting alone or in combination. To better understand bumblebee health, we need to investigate how these factors interact, yet experimental studies to date generally focus on only one or two stressors. The aim of this study is to evaluate how combined effects of four important stressors (the gut parasite Nosema ceranae, the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin and the EBI fungicide tebuconazole) interact to affect bumblebees at the individual and colony levels. We established seven treatment groups of colonies that we pulse exposed to different combinations of these stressors for 2 weeks under laboratory conditions. Colonies were subsequently placed in the field for 7 weeks to evaluate the effect of treatments on the prevalence of N. ceranae in inoculated bumblebees, expression levels of immunity and detoxification-related genes, food collection, weight gain, worker and male numbers, and production of worker brood and reproductives. Exposure to pesticide mixtures reduced food collection by bumblebees. All immunity-related genes were upregulated in the bumblebees inoculated with N. ceranae when they had not been exposed to pesticide mixtures, and bumblebees exposed to the fungicide and the pyrethroid were less likely to have N. ceranae. Combined exposure to the three-pesticide mixture and N. ceranae reduced bumblebee colony growth, and all treatments had detrimental effects on brood production. The groups exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticide produced 40%–76% fewer queens than control colonies. Our findings show that exposure to combinations of stressors that bumblebees frequently come into contact with have detrimental effects on colony health and performance and could therefore have an impact at the population level. These results also have significant implications for current practices and policies for pesticide risk assessment and use as the combinations tested here are frequently applied simultaneously in the field. Understanding the interactions between different stressors will be crucial for improving our ability to manage bee populations and for ensuring pollination services into the future. © 2020 British Ecological Society",2021,10.1111/1365-2656.13375,90,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,

The use of chaperone proteins has been key to successful functional expression of these receptors in heterologous systems, permitting functional and pharmacological studies of insect nAChRs with particular subunit composition. Here, we report the first use of the chaperone protein, NACHO, to enable functional expression of an insect nAChR, the α6 subunit from Apis mellifera, in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is also the first report of functional expression of a homomeric insect α6 nAChR. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology we show that the acetylcholine EC50 of the α6 receptor is 0.88 μM and that acetylcholine responses are antagonized by α-bungarotoxin. Spinosad showed agonist actions and kept the ion channel open when co-applied with acetylcholine, reinforcing the α6 nAChR subunit as a key molecular target for the spinosyn class of insecticide.

Native vegetation embedded in landscapes dominated by corn and soybean improves honey bee health and productivity,315,JOUR,"['Zhang, G', 'Murray, CJ', 'Clair, ALS', 'Cass, RP', 'Dolezal, AG', 'Schulte, LA', 'Toth, AL', ""O'Neal, ME""]",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Balancing demand for food while supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in landscapes committed to crop production may require integrating conservation with agriculture. Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

Natural habitat partially mitigates negative pesticide effects on tropical pollinator communities,121,JOUR,"['Obregon, D', 'Guerrero, OR', 'Stashenko, E', 'Poveda, K']",GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION,"Land-use change and pesticides have been identified as two of the main causes behind pollinator decline. Understanding how these factors affect crop pollinator communities is crucial to inform practices that generate optimal pollination and ensure sustainable food production. In this study, we investigated the effects of landscape composition and pesticide residues on bee communities and their pollination services in Solanum quitoense Lam. ""lulo"" crops in Colombia. On 10 farms, located along a gradient of land use change that varied from 0.15 to 0.62 in their natural habitat proportion, we characterized the bee community visiting the crop, and carried out pollination experiments with bagged and open inflorescences to later estimate fruit set, weight, and diameter at every site. Additionally, we performed pesticide analysis on collected anthers through liquid chromatography to estimate pesticide risk coming from the crop fields using hazard quotients (HQ). Bee abundance and species richness decreased with increased HQ, but these negative pesticide effects were less detrimental in farms with higher natural habitat proportions. However, this buffer effect was lost at sites with very high HQs. Imidacloprid was frequently found in the anthers and there were extremely high concentrations in some farms (0.6 to 13,063 mu g/kg), representing the molecule of greatest risk for bees in this context. Pollinator's importance to crop yield was demonstrated in the exclusion experiments, where we found a reduction in fruit set (51%), weight (39%), and diameter (25%). We found a significant effect of bee richness on fruit set, while landscape composition and HQ had no significant effect on fruit set, suggesting that the last two factors do not affect yield directly, but indirectly through a decrease in pollinator diversity. Our results provide novel evidence that natural habitat loss due to the expansion of pastures for cattle ranching and pesticide residues in anthers reduce bee diversity and abundance in this Andean cropping system, but strategies to protect and restore natural habitat can help to buffer, until certain levels, these negative effects.",2021,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01668,28,1.0,1,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

We treated female bees of two common pollinator species in Europe, Osmia bicornis and Bombus terrestris, with a field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. We tested its effects on the foraging behavior of O. bicornis under semi-natural conditions and on the antennal sensitivity of both bee species to common floral volatiles by using electroantennography. Clothianidin negatively affected the foraging behavior in O. bicornis by decreasing the number of flowers visited per foraging flight and by increasing the time per flower visit and the searching time between two flowers. It also decreased the antennal sensitivity to 2-phenylethanol in the two bee species. Thus, clothianidin is clearly a threat for bees via its effects on their foraging behavior and antennal sensitivity and is hence probably detrimental for pollination and the reproductive success of bees. © Copyright © 2021 Straub, Orih, Kimmich and Ayasse.",2021,10.3389/fevo.2021.697355,9,0.0,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Negative but antagonistic effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor on Apis mellifera honey bee food glands,499,JOUR,"['Bruckner, S.', 'Straub, L.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Williams, G.R.']",Chemosphere,"Collaborative brood care by workers is essential for the functionality of eusocial Apis mellifera honey bee colonies. The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies. Therefore, our findings highlight the need to further study how ubiquitous stressors like V. destructor and neonicotinoids interact to affect honey bees. © 2022 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137535,313,,0,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

We examined for the first time the multidimensional effects of field-realistic concentrations of two common neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) on drone honeybee survival, behaviour and physiology using individuals reared and maintained as adults in the field. Our data showed that neonicotinoids reduced honeybee drone survival by 51%, increased drifting behaviour to non-maternal colonies by 100%, delayed flight activities by 3 days and reduced number of living sperm by 28%. However, they did not influence the sperm concentration produced by the drones, the strength of the drone's maternal colonies or the total number of drones produced by those colonies.

Such declines are known to be driven by a number of interacting factors. Decreases in bee populations may also negatively impact the key ecosystem service, pollination, that they provide. Pesticides and parasites are often cited as two of the drivers of bee declines, particularly as they have previously been found to interact with one another to the detriment of bee health. Here we test the effects of an insecticide, sulfoxaflor, and a highly prevalent bumble bee parasite, Crithidia bombi, on the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. After exposing colonies to realistic doses of either sulfoxaflor and/or Crithidia bombi in a fully crossed experiment, colonies were allowed to forage on field beans in outdoor exclusion cages. Foraging performance was monitored, and the impacts on fruit set were recorded. We found no effect of either stressor, or their interaction, on the pollination services they provide to field beans, either at an individual level or a whole colony level. Further, there was no impact of any treatment, in any metric, on colony development. Our results contrast with prior findings that similar insecticides (neonicotinoids) impact pollination services, and that sulfoxaflor impacts colony development, potentially suggesting that sulfoxaflor is a less harmful compound to bee health than neonicotinoids insecticides. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",2023,10.1038/s41598-023-43215-6,13,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

Neonicotinoid Pesticides Are More Toxic to Honey Bees at Lower Temperatures: Implications for Overwintering Bees,675,JOUR,"['Saleem, M.S.', 'Huang, Z.Y.', 'Milbrath, M.O.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is an important pollinator as well as an important test model for pesticide effects on other insect pollinators. Honey bees have been experiencing high mortality in both the United States and worldwide. Pesticide exposure has been identified as one of the many stressors causing this mortality. Effects of various pesticides have been measured for multiple responses such as learning, memory performance, feeding activity, and thermoregulation. These studies were conducted at many different temperatures (11–35°C); however, few studies compared toxicity of the same pesticide to bees at different temperatures. It is possible that the same pesticide might show different toxicity to honey bees at different temperatures. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered low doses of two neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) at three different temperature scenarios (35°C, 24°C, and a varying temperature) and determined the effects on honey bee survivorship. We discovered that honey bees are much more sensitive to the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam at a constant 24°C or at a varying temperature (night at 13°C and day at 24°C) compared to bees at 35°C. These results suggest that honey bee colonies during winter time will be more sensitive to pesticides. Doses of neonicotinoids that are safe to colonies during summer might kill them during the winter time. © Copyright © 2020 Saleem, Huang and Milbrath.",2020,10.3389/fevo.2020.556856,8,,0,,0.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Neonicotinoid clothianidin adversely affects insect immunity and promotes replication of a viral pathogen in honey bees,974,JOUR,"['Di Prisco, G.', 'Cavaliere, V.', 'Annoscia, D.', 'Varricchio, P.', 'Caprio, E.', 'Nazzi, F.', 'Gargiulo, G.', 'Pennacchio, F.']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Large-scale losses of honey bee colonies represent a poorly understood problem of global importance. Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-κB immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-κB activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-κB signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.",2013,10.1073/pnas.1314923110,110,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Neonicotinoid contamination in conservation areas affects bees more sharply than beetles,188,JOUR,"['Tetlie, J.', 'Harmon-Threatt, A.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The neurotoxic insecticide class of neonicotinoids has become one of the most widely used groups of pesticides globally. Their long half-lives and high water solubility increase their potential to linger and affect numerous organisms long after application. A prominent concern associated with residual contamination is the negative impact that neonicotinoids can have on beneficial arthropods such as bees and certain groups of beetles. Many studies have looked at the effects neonicotinoids have on arthropod communities in lab settings; however, comparatively few studies have looked at these groups in neonicotinoid-contaminated restored prairie habitats. These habitats are often restored from or located near agriculture and are almost ubiquitously contaminated with neonicotinoids. Our one-year manipulated field study compared native bee nesting rates and beetle community assemblages between paired clothianidin-contaminated and non-contaminated restored prairie plots. Native bee nesting probability and nesting abundance increased by 46% and 172%, respectively, in sites contaminated with clothianidin. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in beetle family assemblages, abundance, or richness between clothianidin-contaminated and control sites. These results suggest that neonicotinoid contamination of natural habitats can have numerous environmental consequences for arthropods and that these effects are not always consistent between taxa. Understanding how neonicotinoid contamination affects beneficial groups such as bees and arthropod community assemblages is crucial for characterizing the risks these chemicals pose to ecologically imperative taxa.

Most studies on their influence on pollinators have focused on honey bees given the suitability of this insect for controlled behavioral testing and raising. Yet, studies on pesticide impact should also contemplate tropical species, which contribute a major part of biodiversity and which have remained so far neglected. Here we focused on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata and asked if the widely used neonicotinoid imidacloprid disrupts its learning and memory capabilities. We fed stingless bees with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 ng of imidacloprid, tested their innate appetitive responsiveness and trained them to associate odors and sucrose reward using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. The same experiments were performed on Africanized honey bees. One hour after intoxication, both species decreased their innate responsiveness to sucrose but the effect was more accentuated in stingless bees. In both species, learning and memory were affected in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that pesticides have dramatic consequences on tropical bee species and claim for rational policies regulating their use in the tropics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162859,877,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

We find that exposure to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid impairs nursing and alters social and spatial dynamics within nests, but that these effects vary substantially with time of day. In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy.

Here, we controlled honey bee colony exposure to field-relevant concentrations of 2 neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) in pollen and simultaneously manipulated intracolony genetic heterogeneity. We showed that exposure increased rates of Varroa destructor (Anderson and Trueman) parasitism and that while increased genetic heterogeneity overall improved survivability, it did not reduce the negative effect size of neonicotinoid exposure.

Neonicotinoid insecticide interact with honeybee odorant-binding protein: Implication for olfactory dysfunction,209,JOUR,"['Li, HL', 'Wu, F', 'Zhao, L', 'Tan, J', 'Jiang, HT', 'Hu, FL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES,"The decline of bee population has caused great concern in recent years. A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before. This study may benefit to evaluate the effect of neonicotinoid insecticides on the olfactory cognitive behavior of bees involved in the crops pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

"Neonicotinoid pesticide applications affect pollinator abundance and visitation, leading to implications for sunflower production (Helianthus annuus L.)",529,JOUR,"['Saleem, M.S.', 'Akbar, M.F.', 'Javed, M.A.', 'Sultan, A.']",Cogent Food and Agriculture,"Pesticides are considered a risk to pollinators; however, little is known about the possible effects of their injudicious use on pollinators, including the ecosystem services provided to crops and wildflowers. Recently, great attention has been paid to the effects of neonicotinoids pesticides on pollinators and their potential role in harming the health of bees all over the world. Sunflowers, being self-incompatible plants, rely on insects, primarily bees, for effective cross-pollination and successful seed-set. Ensuring the presence of sufficient pollinators in the field is crucial for facilitating pollen movement between flowers and promoting optimal seed development. However, the reliance on insect-mediated cross-pollination also makes sunflowers susceptible to pest attacks, which can negatively impact seed production. To mitigate these potential threats and achieve increased seed yields, careful consideration is given to the judicious use of pesticides. Striking the right balance between providing adequate pollinators and implementing appropriate pest management strategies is vital for maximizing sunflower crop productivity. To reveal such potential impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides, we undergo the current study that aimed to estimate flower visitation and pollination in a sunflower crop by applying three neonicotinoid insecticides i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, including the control group for two years i.e. 2020, and 2021. In all experimental plots, we quantified floral visitors for fourteen days at three different times (8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm). Floral visitors were divided into three groups, Apis bees, Non-Apis bees, and butterflies. After the maturation period, the achenes from each capitulum were separated and brought for weight. We discovered that this study confirmed the adverse effect of neonicotinoids pesticides on sunflower production. Our research revealed that the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam had a negative impact on the visitation of Apis bees, with reductions of 19%, 18.5%, and 23% respectively, as compared to the control group during the year 2020. Furthermore, these pesticides also caused a decrease in the visitation of Non-Apis bees by 15%, 15%, and 17% respectively. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 17.4%, 14.6%, and 15.8% for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam respectively. Based on our research conducted in the year 2021, the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam caused a reduction of 22.5%, 24%, and 25.5% respectively in the visitation of Apis bees, as compared to the control group. Similarly, non-Apis bees experienced a decrease in visitation by 19.5%, 23.5%, and 25% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 18.2%, 22.2%, and 26% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the use of these pesticides affected the diversity of floral visitors and contributed to a decline in the number of fruit during the year 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the abundance of floral visitors, the mass of fruits, and the quantity of oil in the seeds were significantly lower after treatment with neonicotinoid pesticides, thus evidencing its negative effect on sunflower productivity.

Neonicotinoid pesticide exposure impairs crop pollination services provided by bumblebees,346,JOUR,"['Stanley, DA', 'Garratt, MPD', 'Wickens, JB', 'Wickens, VJ', 'Potts, SG', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Recent concern over global pollinator declines has led to considerable research on the effects of pesticides on bees(1-5). Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems.",2015,10.1038/nature16167,528,0.0,0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Neonicotinoid pesticide limits improvement in buzz pollination by bumblebees,327,JOUR,"['Whitehorn, PR', 'Wallace, C', 'Vallejo-Marin, M']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Neonicotinoid pesticides have been linked to global declines of beneficial insects such as bumblebees. Exposure to trace levels of these chemicals causes sub-lethal effects, such as reduced learning and foraging efficiency. Complex behaviours may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids. Such behaviours may include buzz pollination (sonication), in which pollinators, usually bees, use innate and learned behaviours to generate high-frequency vibrations to release pollen from flowers with specialised anther morphologies. This study assesses the effect of field-realistic, chronic exposure to the widely-used neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on the development of sonication buzz characteristics over time, as well as the collection of pollen from buzz-pollinated flowers. We found that the pollen collection of exposed bees improved less with increasing experience than that of unexposed bees, with exposed bees collecting between 47% and 56% less pollen by the end of 10 trials. We also found evidence of two distinct strategies for maximising pollen collection: (1) extensions to the duration of individual buzzes and (2) extensions of the overall time spent buzzing. We find new complexities in buzz pollination, and conclude that the impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide may seriously compromise this important ecosystem service.",2017,10.1038/s41598-017-14660-x,7,,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

Declines in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for synergistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure (-50%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors reduced also food consumption (-48%) and haemolymph levels of glucose (-60%) and trehalose (-27%).

Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness). As decreased genetic diversity among worker bees is known to negatively affect colony vitality, neonicotinoids may have a cryptic effect on colony health by reducing the mating frequency of queens.",2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0186109,12,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

The behavioral changes we observed in honey bees chronically exposed to neonicotinoid via diet could negatively affect individual honey bee performance of hive duties and consequently, colony survival during cold weather. © 2021 International Bee Research Association.",2021,10.1080/00218839.2021.1908739,60,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Neonicotinoids Interfere with Specific Components of Navigation in Honeybees,207,JOUR,"['Fischer, J', 'Müller, T', 'Spatz, AK', 'Greggers, U', 'Grünewald, B', 'Menzel, R']",PLOS ONE,"Three neonicotinoids, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiacloprid, agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the central brain of insects, were applied at non-lethal doses in order to test their effects on honeybee navigation. A catch-and-release experimental design was applied in which feeder trained bees were caught when arriving at the feeder, treated with one of the neonicotinoids, and released 1.5 hours later at a remote site. The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar. The initial flight phase controlled by the recently acquired navigation memory (vector memory) was less compromised than the second phase that leads the animal back to the hive (homing flight). The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory. These findings are discussed in the context of the application of neonicotinoids in plant protection.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091364,9,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neonicotinoids and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris): Effects on nectar consumption in individual workers,924,JOUR,"['Thompson, H.M.', 'Wilkins, S.', 'Harkin, S.', 'Milner, S.', 'Walters, K.F.A.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to quantify whether the presence of three different neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam or clothianidin) in sucrose solution results in antifeedant effects in individual worker bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), and, if so, whether this effect is reversible if bees are subsequently offered untreated feed. RESULTS: Bees exposed to imidacloprid displayed a significant dose-dependent reduction in consumption at 10 and 100 μg L-1, which was reversed when untreated feed was offered. No consistent avoidance/antifeedant response to nectar substitute with thiamethoxam was detected at the more field-realistic dose rates of 1 and 10 μg L-1, and exposure to the very high 100 μg L-1 dose rate was followed by 100% mortality of experimental insects. No reduction in food intake was recorded at 1 μg clothianidin L-1, reduced consumption was noted at 10 μg clothianidin L-1 and 100% mortality occurred when bees were exposed to rates of 100 μg clothianidin L-1. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of a direct antifeedant effect of imidacloprid and clothianidin in individual bumblebees but highlights that this may be a compound-specific effect. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.",2015,10.1002/ps.3868,71,,0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Neonicotinoids decrease sucrose responsiveness of honey bees at first contact,810,JOUR,"['Démares, F.J.', 'Pirk, C.W.W.', 'Nicolson, S.W.', 'Human, H.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"For two decades, neonicotinoid insecticides have been extensively used worldwide. Targeting neuronal receptors, they have deleterious effects on the behaviour and physiology of many insects. Bees are exposed to these insecticides in pollen and nectar while providing pollination services to agricultural crops, and neonicotinoids have been shown to impair navigation and decrease their foraging activity. We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested. This attenuation of sucrose response is further evidence that neonicotinoids are multisensory disruptors, with potent actions against pollinators and other beneficial insects at first contact. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.05.004,108,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Neonicotinoids disrupt circadian rhythms and sleep in honey bees,68,JOUR,"['Tackenberg, M.C.', 'Giannoni-Guzmán, M.A.', 'Sanchez-Perez, E.', 'Doll, C.A.', 'Agosto-Rivera, J.L.', 'Broadie, K.', 'Moore, D.', 'McMahon, D.G.']",Scientific Reports,"Honey bees are critical pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture, but their numbers have significantly declined. Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1038/s41598-020-72041-3,10,,0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Neonicotinoids impact bumblebee colony fitness in the field; a reanalysis of the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency 2012 experiment,373,JOUR,"['Goulson, D']",PEERJ,"The causes of bee declines remain hotly debated, particularly the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides. In 2013 the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices. It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.",2015,10.7717/peerj.854,3,0.0,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Neonicotinoids in the agroecosystem: In-field long-term assessment on honeybee colony strength and microbiome,654,JOUR,"['Alberoni, D.', 'Favaro, R.', 'Baffoni, L.', 'Angeli, S.', 'Di Gioia, D.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bees can be severely affected by various plant protection products (PPP). Among these, neonicotinoid insecticides are of concern as they have been shown to be responsible for extensive honeybee colonies death when released into the environment. Also, sublethal neonicotinoid doses contaminating single honeybees and their colonies (e.g. through contaminated pollen) are responsible for honeybees physiological alterations with probable implication also on microbiome functionality. Honeybees show symbiotic interactions with specific gut bacteria that can enhance the adult host performances. Among the known mechanisms, the modulation of the immune system, the degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites, pollen digestion, and hormonal signaling, are the most important functional benefits for the host honeybee. To date, few research efforts have aimed at revealing the impact of PPP on the gut microbial community of managed and wild honeybees. The majority of the existing literature relays on cage or semifield tests of short duration for research investigating neonicotinoids-gut microbiome interactions. This research wanted to unravel the impact of two neonicotinoids (i.e. imidacloprid and thiacloprid) in natural field conditions up to 5 weeks of exposure. A long-term impact of neonicotinoids on gut microbial community of honeybees was observed. The alterations affected several microbial genera and species such as Frischella spp., lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, whose shifting is implicated in intestinal dysbiosis. Long-term impact leading to dysbiosis was detected in case of exposure to imidacloprid, whereas thiacloprid exposure stimulated temporary dysbiosis. Moreover, the microbial diversity was significantly reduced in neonicotinoid-treated groups. Overall, the reported results support a compromised functionality of the gut microbial community, that might reflect a lower efficiency in the ecosystemic functionality of honeybees. © 2020",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144116,762,,0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells, indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior. Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level, only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental effects of clothianidin were observed. Given these findings, neonicotinoid risk needs to be considered independently for each compound and target species. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",2016,10.1038/srep24764,6,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,
"New approaches to old problems: Removal of phospholipase A2 results in highly active microsomal membranes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera",253,JOUR,"['Zaworra, M.', 'Nauen, R.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Over the last 50 years numerous studies were published by insect toxicologists using native microsomal membrane preparations in order to investigate in vitro cytochrome P450-(P450) mediated oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, including insecticides. Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites. Our work provides access to a new and simple in vitro tool to study honey bee phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics utilising the entire range of microsomal cytochrome P450s. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.014,161,,0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

However, toxicological understanding of neonicotinoid insecticides on gut microbiota is limited. In the present study, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were exposed to a series of nitenpyram for 14 days. Results indicated that nitenpyram exposure decreased the survival and food consumption of honey bees. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that nitenpyram caused significant alterations in the relative abundance of several key gut microbiotas, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis and immunity. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis, we identified a total of 526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly altered between nitenpyram-treated and control honey bee gut, including several genes related to metabolic, detoxification and immunity. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed nitenpyram affected several biological processes, of which most were related to metabolism. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in honey bee caused by nitenpyram may influence metabolic homeostasis and immunity of bees, and further decrease food consumption and survival of bees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113671,258,,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
No effect of low-level chronic neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebee learning and fecundity,177,JOUR,"['Piiroinen, S', 'Botías, C', 'Nicholls, E', 'Goulson, D']",PEERJ,"In recent years, many pollinators have declined in abundance and diversity worldwide, presenting a potential threat to agricultural productivity, biodiversity and the functioning of natural ecosystems. One of the most debated factors proposed to be contributing to pollinator declines is exposure to pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic insecticide. Also, newly emerging parasites and diseases, thought to be spread via contact with managed honeybees, may pose threats to other pollinators such as bumblebees. Compared to honeybees, bumblebees could be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stressors due to their smaller and more short-lived colonies. Here, we studied the effect of field-realistic, chronic clothianidin exposure and inoculation with the parasite Nosema ceranae on survival, fecundity, sugar water collection and learning using queenless Bombus terrestris audax microcolonies in the laboratory. Chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin had no significant effects on the traits studied. Interestingly, pesticide exposure in combination with additional stress caused by harnessing bees for Proboscis Extension Response (PER) learning assays, led to an increase in mortality. In contrast to previous findings, the bees did not become infected by N. ceranae after experimental inoculation with the parasite spores, suggesting variability in host resistance or parasite virulence. However, this treatment induced a slight, short-term reduction in sugar water collection, potentially through stimulation of the immune system of the bees. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin does not have adverse effects on bumblebee fecundity or learning ability.",2016,10.7717/peerj.1808,4,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Here, we conducted a highly replicated full-factorial semi-field experiment with the solitary bee Osmia bicornis, an important pollinator of crops and wild plants in Europe, and Phacelia tanacetifolia as a model crop. We show that spray applications of the insecticide sulfoxaflor (product Closer) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (product Amistar), both alone and combined, had no significant negative impacts on adult female survival or the production, mortality, sex ratio and body size of offspring when sulfoxaflor was applied five days before crop flowering. Our results indicate that for O. bicornis (1) the risk of adverse impacts of sulfoxaflor (Closer) on fitness is small when applied at least five days before crop flowering and (2) that azoxystrobin (Amistar) has a low potential of exacerbating sulfoxaflor effects under field-realistic conditions. © 2022 The Author(s)",2022,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107252,164,0.0,0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,
No evidence for negative impacts of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on bee olfactory conditioning or working memory,770,JOUR,"['Siviter, H.', 'Scott, A.', 'Pasquier, G.', 'Pull, C.D.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",PeerJ,"Systemic insecticides such as neonicotinoids and sulfoximines can be present in the nectar and pollen of treated crops, through which foraging bees can become acutely exposed. Research has shown that acute, field realistic dosages of neonicotinoids can negatively influence bee learning and memory, with potential consequences for bee behaviour. As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm. Our results suggest that despite a shared mode of action between sulfoxaflor and neonicotinoidbased insecticides, widely-documented effects of neonicotinoids on bee cognition may not be observed with sulfoxaflor, at least at acute exposure regimes.

Data show that field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect both population density and the fitness of solitary bees. However, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using an established semi-field experimental set-up and Osmia cornuta as a solitary bee model, we examined the effects of field-realistic concentrations of a common neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin) on male larvae and adults. Besides measuring lethal (i.e., overwintering success and adult survival) and sub-lethal endpoints (i.e., emergence mass and emergence duration), we examined, for the first time, potential effects on the male reproductive physiology of a solitary bee (i.e., sperm quantity and viability). The data revealed no significant effects on any of the measured response variables. This may be due to the low degree of clothianidin exposure (0.56 ng g−1) and/or the apparent low susceptibility of solitary bee larvae to neonicotinoids. Furthermore, it is conceivable that ideal foraging conditions, combined with optimal weather and lack of other environmental stressors, may have improved the ability of bees to cope with the insecticide. To reliably assess and understand the environmental hazards of agrochemicals, a holistic approach, including laboratory, semi-field and field data is required.

Ecotoxicogenomics, including transcriptomics, measures responses in individual organisms at the molecular level which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying phenotypic responses induced by one or more stressors and link impacts on individuals to populations. Here, fifth instar honey bee larvae were sampled from a previously reported field experiment exploring the phenotypic impacts of environmentally realistic chronic exposures of the pesticide imidacloprid (5 mu g.kg(-1) for six weeks) and the acaricide thymol (250 g.kg(-1) applied via Apiguard gel in-hive for four weeks), both separately and in combination. RNA-seq was used to discover individual and interactive chemical effects on larval gene expression and to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to reported adult and colony phenotypes. The separate and combined treatments had distinct gene expression profiles which represented differentially affected signaling and metabolic pathways. The molecular signature of the mixture was characterised by additive interactions in canonical stress responses associated with oxidative stress and detoxification, and non-additive interactions in secondary responses including developmental, neurological, and immune pathways. Novel emergent impacts on eye development genes correlated with long-term defects in visual learning performance as adults.

In a 15-day cage experiment, three cohorts of one-day-old sister bees emerged in incubators, were distributed into cages, and maintained at three different temperatures (26 °C, 32 °C, 38 °C). Each cohort was fed a protein patty and three concentrations of imidacloprid-tainted sugar (0 ppb, 5 ppb and 20 ppb) ad libitum. Honey bee mortality, syrup and patty consumption were monitored daily over 15 days. Bees were sampled every three days for a total of five time points. RT-qPCR was used to longitudinally assess gene regulation of Vg, mrjp1, Rsod, AChE-2 and Trx-1 using RNA extracted from whole bee bodies. Kaplan–Meier models show that bees kept at both non-optimal temperatures (26 °C and 38 °C) were more susceptible to imidacloprid, with significantly higher mortality (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the control. At 32 °C, no differences in mortality (P = 0.3) were recorded among treatments. In both imidacloprid treatment groups and the control, the expression of Vg and mrjp1 was significantly downregulated at 26 °C and 38 °C compared to the optimal temperature of 32 °C, indicating major influence of ambient temperature on the regulation of these genes. Within the ambient temperature groups, both imidacloprid treatments exclusively downregulated Vg and mrjp1 at 26 °C. AChE-2 and the poorly characterized Rsod gene were both consistently upregulated at the highest temperature (38 °C) compared to the ideal temperature (32 °C) in all treatment groups. Trx-1 showed no effect to both temperature and imidacloprid treatments and was regulated in an age-related manner.

We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation.

Parallel, a laboratory study was conducted investigating whether pesticide exposure alone without the influence of flight activity caused similar expression patterns as in the RFID experiment. No significant effect on survival, homing flight duration, or return rate of exposed bees was detected. The overall time foragers spent outside the hive was significantly reduced post-exposure. Irrespective of the treatment group, a correlation was observed between cox5a, cox5b, cox17 and hbg-3 expression and prolonged homing flight duration. Our results suggest that flight behavior can impact gene expression and exposure to pesticides adversely affects the expression of genes that are important for maintaining optimal flight capacity. Our laboratory-based experiment showed significantly altered expression levels of cox5a, cox6c, and cox17. However, further work is needed to identify transcriptional profiles responsible for prolonged homing flight duration. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,10.1038/s41598-024-73235-9,14,,0,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

We conducted a semi-field experiment to examine the single and interactive effects of the novel insecticide flupyradifurone (FPF) and nutritional stress on fitness proxies in the solitary bee Osmia bicornis. Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure. Within the first day after application of FPF, mortality of bees feeding on buckwheat was 29 times higher compared with control treatments, while mortality of FPF exposed and control bees was similar in the other two plant species. Moreover, we found negative synergistic impacts of FPF and nutritional stress on offspring production, flight activity, flight duration and flower visitation frequency. These results reveal that environmental policies and risk assessment schemes that ignore interactions among anthropogenic stressors will fail to adequately protect bees and the pollination services they provide.  © 2022 The Authors.",2022,10.1098/rspb.2022.1013,289,,0,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,
One size does not fit all: Caste and sex differences in the response of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to chronic oral neonicotinoid exposure,257,JOUR,"['Mobley, MW', 'Gegear, RJ']",PLOS ONE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in the rapid global decline of bumblebees over recent years, particularly in agricultural and urban areas. While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.",2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0200041,13,,0,1.0,0.0,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

However, the widespread use of insecticides such as neonicotinoids may affect the survival, development, behavior, and maintenance of bee colonies. Therefore, in this study we evaluated the impacts of three neonicotinoid insecticides on the survival and walking abilities of the Africanized honeybee A. mellifera and stingless bee S. postica. A. mellifera was more susceptible than S. postica to all neonicotinoids tested. The median lethal concentrations LC50 values estimated for acetamiprid, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid were 189.62, 22.78, and 142.31 ng µL–1 of diet for A. mellifera, and 475.94, 89.11, and 218.21 ng µL–1 of diet for S. postica, respectively. All tested neonicotinoids affected the speed, distance traveled, duration and frequency of resting, and continuous mobility of both bee species. The results showed that in spite of the different susceptibility to compounds with cyano and nitro radicals, the behavioral variables showed different levels of commitment according to the molecule insecticide and bee species.

However, the sublethal effects of pesticide residue levels found in pollen and nectar on pollinators have been studied little. The aim of our research was to study whether oral exposure to the thiacloprid levels found in pollen and nectar affect the learning and long-term memory of bumble bees. We tested the effects of two exposure levels of thiacloprid-based pesticide (Calypso SC480) on buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) in laboratory utilizing a learning performance and memory tasks designed to be difficult enough to reveal large variations across the individuals. Results: The lower exposure level of the thiacloprid-based pesticide impaired the bees’ learning performance but not long-term memory compared to the untreated controls. The higher exposure level caused severe acute symptoms, due to which we were not able to test the learning and memory. Conclusions: Our results show that oral exposure to a thiacloprid-based pesticide, calculated based on residue levels found in pollen and nectar, not only causes sublethal effects but also acute lethal effects on bumble bees. Our study underlines an urgent demand for better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment, and of the effects of those residue levels on pollinators.

However, pesticide risk assessment tests pesticides in isolation from other stresses, i.e., on otherwise healthy bees. Through molecular analysis, the specific impacts of a pesticide or its interaction with another stressor can be elucidated. Molecular mass profiling by MALDI BeeTyping((R)) was used on bee haemolymph to explore the signature of pesticidal and parasitic stressor impacts. This approach was complemented by bottom-up proteomics to investigate the modulation of the haemoproteome. We tested acute oral doses of three pesticides-glyphosate, Amistar and sulfoxaflor-on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, alongside the gut parasite Crithidia bombi. We found no impact of any pesticide on parasite intensity and no impact of sulfoxaflor or glyphosate on survival or weight change. Amistar caused weight loss and 19-41% mortality. Haemoproteome analysis showed various protein dysregulations. The major pathways dysregulated were those involved in insect defences and immune responses, with Amistar having the strongest impact on these dysregulated pathways. Our results show that even when no response can be seen at a whole organism level, MALDI BeeTyping((R)) can detect effects.

Past insecticide exposure reduces bee reproduction and population growth rate,619,JOUR,"['Stuligross, C.', 'Williams, N.M.']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Pesticides are linked to global insect declines, with impacts on biodiversity and essential ecosystem services. In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed “carryover” effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Performance of honey bee colonies under a long-lasting dietary exposure to sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid,872,JOUR,"['Siede, R.', 'Faust, L.', 'Meixner, M.D.', 'Maus, C.', 'Grünewald, B.', 'Büchler, R.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Substantial honey bee colony losses have occurred periodically in the last decades. The drivers for these losses are not fully understood. The influence of pests and pathogens are beyond dispute, but in addition, chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides has been suggested to affect the performance of honey bee colonies. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations (one realistic worst-case concentration) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to honey bee colonies in a three year replicated colony feeding study. RESULTS: Thiacloprid did not significantly affect the colony strength. No differences between treatment and control were observed for the mortality of bees, the infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the infection levels of viruses. No colony losses occurred during the overwintering seasons. Furthermore, thiacloprid did not influence the constitutive expression of the immunity-related hymenoptaecin gene. However, upregulation of hymenoptaecin expression as a response to bacterial challenge was less pronounced in exposed bees than in control bees. CONCLUSION: Under field conditions, bee colonies are not adversely affected by a long-lasting exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid. No indications were found that field-realistic and higher doses exerted a biologically significant effect on colony performance. © 2017 The Authors.

Two apiaries were located in two independent neonicotinoid-treated cornfield areas and two others in two independent untreated cornfield areas used as controls. These experimental hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of one year. Trapped pollen was collected and microscopically identified to define the visited flowers and the amount of corn pollen collected by bees. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to detect pesticide residues in honeybee foragers and trapped pollen. Honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid-treated cornfields expressed significantly higher varroa mite loads than those in untreated cornfields. However, brood production and colony weight were less disturbed by the treatment factor. Sublethal doses of neonicotinoids were detected in the trapped corn pollen and none in bee foragers. Overall, our results show that forager bees collected 20% of corn pollen containing variable concentrations of neonicotinoids.

Pest management practices impact Helicoverpa armigera infestation and foraging behaviour of pollinators in sunflower,101,JOUR,"['Shankar, U.', 'Mukhtar, Y.']",International Journal of Pest Management,"Field experiments for two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) were conducted to record population dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera Hubner and foraging behaviour of pollinators in sunflower before and after undertaking pest management practices. The study disclosed that H. armigera (larvae) crossed ETL (Economic Threshold Level) from 10th SW (Standard Week), warranting application of pest management measures. Many pollinator species were observed foraging on sunflowers during the same time. The least foraging by pollinators was recorded in early morning and late evening hours, depicting avoidance of insecticide application when pollinator foraging activity is maximum. A combination of synthetic and bio-insecticides (Chlorantraniliprole, Bt-kurstaki, Emamectin-benzoate, Spinosad, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Novaluron, and Neem-oil) were tested for their efficacy against H. armigera and impact on foraging behaviour of pollinators. Bio-insecticide-treated plots recorded significantly higher number of foraging pollinators as compared to synthetic-insecticide-treated plots. Of the insecticides used, Chlorantraniliprole showed highest efficacy against H. armigera but recorded lowest foraging activity of pollinators in both the years of study.

Pesticide exposure affects flight dynamics and reduces flight endurance in bumblebees,255,JOUR,"['Kenna, D', 'Cooley, H', 'Pretelli, I', 'Rodrigues, AR', 'Gill, SD', 'Gill, RJ']",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The emergence of agricultural land use change creates a number of challenges that insect pollinators, such as eusocial bees, must overcome. Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.",2019,10.1002/ece3.5143,9,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

Here we exposed honey bee colonies during three brood generations to sub-lethal doses of a widely used pesticide, imidacloprid, and then subsequently challenged newly emerged bees with the gut parasite, Nosema spp. The pesticide dosages used were below levels demonstrated to cause effects on longevity or foraging in adult honey bees. Nosema infections increased significantly in the bees from pesticide-treated hives when compared to bees from control hives demonstrating an indirect effect of pesticides on pathogen growth in honey bees. We clearly demonstrate an increase in pathogen growth within individual bees reared in colonies exposed to one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide, imidacloprid, at below levels considered harmful to bees. The finding that individual bees with undetectable levels of the target pesticide, after being reared in a sub-lethal pesticide environment within the colony, had higher Nosema is significant.

"Pesticide hazard, floral resource availability and natural enemies interactively drive the fitness of bee species depending on their crop fidelity",1042,JOUR,"['Knauer, A', 'Naef, C', 'Albrecht, M']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Pesticides, loss of floral resources and parasitism are considered drivers of wild bee decline in agroecosystems, but their interactions are poorly understood under field conditions. Negative impacts are predicted to vary across species of distinct crop fidelity because of the associated consequences for pesticide exposure and dependence on wild flowers. We experimentally established populations of two solitary bee species in apple orchards with distinct pesticide hazard and flower availability in surrounding landscapes. The number of nesting females, their reproduction and offspring survival and parasitism rate were tracked throughout apple bloom. We show that in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta, which showed a strong preference to forage in apple orchards, the number of females remaining at nesting sites towards the end of apple bloom and the overall reproductive success of the released bees declined with pesticide hazard. In contrast, the closely related Osmia bicornis, which showed a lower preference for apple, was not affected by pesticide use in orchards. Floral resource distribution furthermore modulated parasitism rates in both species: while large amounts of locally available resources reduced offspring parasitism, it increased with relatively higher food availability in the landscapes surrounding focal orchards, probably due to the bees foraging on a larger scale and thus longer periods during which nests remained unattended. Our findings provide novel insights into the complex interplay of pesticide exposure, flower availability and parasitism risk driving population dynamics of bees in agroecosystems. They show that in particular the most reliable crop pollinator species are especially harmed by high pesticide use in crops. Our study underpins the key role of reducing pesticide risks for pollinators through effective regulation of potentially hazardous agrochemicals and the promotion of alternative pest regulation approaches along with conserving and restoring flower-rich habitats to sustain pollinator populations in agroecosystems.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171058,922,0.0,1,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Pesticide reduces bumblebee colony initiation and increases probability of population extinction,836,JOUR,"['Baron, G.L.', 'Jansen, V.A.A.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Nature Ecology and Evolution,"Pollinators are in global decline and agricultural pesticides are a potential driver of this. Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies - an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,10.1038/s41559-017-0260-1,1,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Pesticide risk assessment at the molecular level using honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes: A complementary approach,649,JOUR,"['Haas, J.', 'Nauen, R.']",Environment International,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) first-tier pesticide risk assessment is largely based on standardized laboratory toxicity bioassays after both acute and chronic exposure. Recent research on honey bee cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) uncovered CYP9Q3 as the molecular determinant mediating neonicotinoid insecticide selectivity and explaining why certain neonicotinoids such as thiacloprid show > 1000-fold lower acute toxicity than others (e.g. imidacloprid). Here this knowledge is leveraged for mechanistic risk assessment at the molecular level using a fluorescence-based high-throughput in vitro assay, predicting the interaction of diverse pesticidal chemotypes, including azole fungicides, with recombinantly expressed honey bee CYP9Q enzymes, known to metabolize thiacloprid, acetamiprid and tau-fluvalinate. Some azole fungicides were shown to be synergistic in combination with certain insecticides, including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, whereas others such as prothioconazole were not. We demonstrate that biochemical CYP9Q2/CYP9Q3 inhibition data of azoles revealed a striking correlation with their synergistic potential at the organismal level, and even allow to explain combined toxicity effects observed for tank mixtures under field conditions. Our novel toxicogenomics-based approach is designed to complement existing methods for pesticide risk assessment with unprecedented screening capacity, by utilizing honey bee P450 enzymes known to confer pesticide selectivity, in order to biochemically address issues of ecotoxicological concern. © 2020 The Author(s)",2021,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106372,147,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Pesticide risk assessment: honeybee workers are not all equal regarding the risk posed by exposure to pesticides,226,JOUR,"['Barascou, L', 'Sene, D', 'Le Conte, Y', 'Alaux, C']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Toxicological studies in honeybees have long shown that a single pesticide dose or concentration does not necessarily induce a single response. Inter-individual differences in pesticide sensitivity and/or the level of exposure (e.g., ingestion of pesticide-contaminated matrices) may explain this variability in risk posed by a pesticide. Therefore, to better inform pesticide risk assessment for honeybees, we studied the risk posed by pesticides to two behavioral castes, nurse, and forager bees, which are largely represented within colonies and which exhibit large differences in their physiological backgrounds. For that purpose, we determined the sensitivity of nurses and foragers to azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) upon acute or chronic exposure. Azoxystrobin was found to be weakly toxic to both types of bees. However, foragers were more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than nurses upon acute and chronic exposure. This phenomenon was not explained by better sulfoxaflor metabolization in nurses, but rather by differences in body weight (nurses being 1.6 times heavier than foragers). Foragers consistently consumed more sugar syrup than nurses, and this increased consumption was even more pronounced with pesticide-contaminated syrup (at specific concentrations). Altogether, the stronger susceptibility and exposure of foragers to sulfoxaflor contributed to increases of 2 and tenfold for the acute and chronic risk quotients, respectively, compared to nurses. In conclusion, to increase the safety margin and avoid an under-estimation of the risk posed by insecticides to honeybees, we recommend systematically including forager bees in regulatory tests.",2022,10.1007/s11356-022-21969-2,29,,0,,1.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Field studies demonstrated that agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect wild bee species1,2, leading to restrictions on these compounds3. However, besides neonicotinoids, field-based evidence of the effects of landscape pesticide exposure on wild bees is lacking. Bees encounter many pesticides in agricultural landscapes4–9 and the effects of this landscape exposure on colony growth and development of any bee species remains unknown. Here we show that the many pesticides found in bumble bee-collected pollen are associated with reduced colony performance during crop bloom, especially in simplified landscapes with intensive agricultural practices. Our results from 316 Bombus terrestris colonies at 106 agricultural sites across eight European countries confirm that the regulatory system fails to sufficiently prevent pesticide-related impacts on non-target organisms, even for a eusocial pollinator species in which colony size may buffer against such impacts10,11. These findings support the need for postapproval monitoring of both pesticide exposure and effects to confirm that the regulatory process is sufficiently protective in limiting the collateral environmental damage of agricultural pesticide use. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,10.1038/s41586-023-06773-3,628,0.0,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
"Pharmacology of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of cultured Kenyon cells of the honeybee, Apis mellifera",423,JOUR,"['Wüstenberg, D.G.', 'Grünewald, B.']","Journal of Comparative Physiology A: Neuroethology, Sensory, Neural, and Behavioral Physiology","We investigated the pharmacology of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor of honeybee Kenyon cells, a subset of olfactory interneurons, which are crucial for olfactory learning and memory. Whole-cell currents were recorded using patch-clamp techniques. Pressure application of agonists induced inward currents in cultured Kenyon cells at holding potentials of -110 mV. Acetylcholine or carbamylcholine were full agonists, nicotine, epibatidine and cytisine were only partial agonists. Coapplications of these partial agonists with acetylcholine reduced the current amplitude. The most efficient antagonists were dihydroxy-β-erythroidine (EC50 = 0.5 pmol·l-1) and methyllycaconitine (EC50 = 24 pmol·l-1). The open channel blocker mecamylamine, d-tubocurarine and hexamethonium were rather weak blockers of the honeybee nicotinic response. Bath applications of the muscarinic antagonist atropine inhibited nicotinic currents dependent on concentration (EC50 = 24.3 μmol·l-1). Muscarine, pilocarpine or oxotremorine (1 mmol·l-1) did not induce any measurable currents. The non-cholinergic drugs strychnine, bicuculline and picrotoxin partially and reversibly blocked the acetylcholine-induced currents. Our results indicate the expression of only one nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype in cultured Kenyon cells. Muscarinic as well as non-cholinergic antagonists also inhibit the receptor function, distinguishing the honeybee nicotinic receptor from the ""typical"" nicotinic receptor of vertebrates and from many described insects receptors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",2004,10.1007/s00359-004-0530-7,190,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,
Phylogenomic and functional characterization of an evolutionary conserved cytochrome P450-based insecticide detoxification mechanism in bees,556,JOUR,"['Haas, J.', 'Hayward, A.', 'Buer, B.', 'Maiwald, F.', 'Nebelsiek, B.', 'Glaubitz, J.', 'Bass, C.', 'Nauen, R.']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"The regulatory process for assessing the risks of pesticides to bees relies heavily on the use of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, as a model for other bee species. However, the validity of using A. mellifera as a surrogate for other Apis and non-Apis bees in pesticide risk assessment has been questioned. Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear. Here we used a phylogenomic approach to identify > 100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families. Functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species revealed that P450-mediated detoxification of certain systemic insecticides, including the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the butenolide flupyradifurone, is conserved across all major bee pollinator families. However, our analyses also reveal that CYP9Q-related genes are not universal to all bee species, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes. Thus, our results reveal an evolutionary conserved capacity to metabolize certain insecticides across all major bee families while identifying a small number of bee species where this function may have been lost. Furthermore, they illustrate the potential of a toxicogenomic approach to inform pesticide risk assessment for nonmanaged bee species by predicting the capability of bee pollinator species to break down synthetic insecticides. copyright © 2022 the Author(s).",2022,10.1073/pnas.2205850119,119,0.0,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Physiological analysis and transcriptome analysis of asian honey bee (Apis cerana cerana) in response to sublethal neonicotinoid imidacloprid,684,JOUR,"['Gao, J.', 'Jin, S.-S.', 'He, Y.', 'Luo, J.-H.', 'Xu, C.-Q.', 'Wu, Y.-Y.', 'Hou, C.-S.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Diao, Q.-Y.']",Insects,"Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is the most important Chinese indigenous species, while its toxicological characteristic against neonicotinoids is poorly known. Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up-and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian honey bee in response to neonicotinoids sublethal toxicity, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyse the physiological and biochemical changes in female adult Osmia bicornis bees upon continuous oral exposure to three insecticide-based agrochemicals – i.e. Dursban 480 EC (active ingredient - a.i. chlorpyrifos), Sherpa 100 EC (a.i. cypermethrin), and Mospilan 20 SP (a.i. acetamiprid), in a toxicokinetic manner (feeding with either insecticide-contaminated food or uncontaminated food (controls) for 8 d in the contamination phase followed by 8 d of decontamination (i.e. feeding with uncontaminated food)). All three tested agrochemicals altered the energetic budget of bees by the deprivation of energy derived from lipids and carbohydrates (but not proteins) and/or a decrease in respiration based metabolic rate (energy consumption) compared to the controls. The activities of acetylcholinesterase and glutathione-S-transferase enzymes were not altered by insecticides at tested concentrations. These results show that chronic exposure to at least some pesticides even at relatively low concentrations may cause severe physiological disruptions that could potentially be damaging for the solitary bees. © 2021 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113095,230,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,
Physiological effects of field concentrations and sublethal concentrations of sulfoxaflor on Apis mellifera,400,JOUR,"['Wang, S.', 'Fan, W.', 'Ji, W.', 'Wang, K.', 'Gull, S.', 'Li, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Ji, T.', 'Liu, J.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Bees (Apis mellifera), as important pollinators of agricultural crops, are at risk when pesticides are used. Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of sulfoxaflor and its effect on the A. mellifera exposure. RESULTS: Initially, developmental indicators such as larval survival, pupation, and eclosion were inhibited by 5.0 mg/L (field concentration) sulfoxaflor. In the pupal stage, fat content was significantly increased, while the glycogen content decreased. In addition, A. mellifera heads were treated with 2.0 mg/L (sublethal concentration) of sulfoxaflor and analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome results indicated that 2.0 mg/L amounts of sulfoxaflor have adverse effects on the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Sulfoxaflor down-regulated the expression of many genes involved in immunity, detoxification, the myosin cytoskeleton, sensory neurons, and odor-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: Field concentration and sublethal concentration were used for the combined analysis of honeybees. The effect of sublethal concentration of sulfoxaflor on honeybees was studied for the first time from the perspective of transcriptome sequencing of honeybee head. A preliminary study was carried out on the stress of sulfoxaflor at sublethal concentration on honeybee workers, which has certain research significance and can provide theoretical basis for the use of sulfoxaflor in the field environment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024,10.1002/ps.8326,80,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,
Physiological responses of the stingless bee Partamona helleri to oral exposure to three agrochemicals: impact on antioxidant enzymes and hemocyte count,396,JOUR,"['Botina, L.L.', 'Barbosa, W.F.', 'Viana, T.A.', 'de Oliveira Faustino, A.', 'Martins, G.F.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Agrochemicals pose significant threats to the survival of bees, yet the physiological impacts of sublethal doses on stingless bees remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to three commercial formulations of agrochemicals [CuSO4 (leaf fertilizer), glyphosate (herbicide), and spinosad (bioinsecticide)] on antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde content (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and total hemocyte count (THC) in the stingless bee Partamona helleri. Foragers were exposed to lethal concentrations aimed to kill 5% (LC5) of CuSO4 (120 μg mL−1) or spinosad (0.85 μg mL−1) over a 24-h period. Glyphosate-exposed bees received the recommended label concentration (7400 μg mL−1), as they exhibited 100% survival after exposure. Ingestion of CuSO4 or glyphosate-treated diets by bees was reduced. Levels of NO and catalase (CAT) remained unaffected at 0 h or 24 h post-exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher at 0 h compared to 24 h, although insignificantly so when compared to the control. Exposure to CuSO4 reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity at 0 h but increased it after 24 h, for both CuSO4 and glyphosate. MDA levels decreased after 0 h exposure to CuSO4 or spinosad but increased after 24 h exposure to all tested agrochemicals. THC showed no difference among glyphosate or spinosad compared to the control or across time. However, CuSO4 exposure significantly increased THC. These findings shed light on the physiological responses of stingless bees to agrochemicals, crucial for understanding their overall health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34790-w,31,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Planting of neonicotinoid-coated corn raises honey bee mortality and sets back colony development,878,JOUR,"['Samson-Robert, O.', 'Labrie, G.', 'Chagnon, M.', 'Fournier, V.']",PeerJ,"Worldwide occurrences of honey bee colony losses have raised concerns about bee health and the sustainability of pollination-dependent crops. While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments. © 2017 Samson-Robert et al.",2017,10.7717/peerj.3670,2017,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Pollen diet mediates how pesticide exposure impacts brain gene expression in nest-founding bumble bee queens,134,JOUR,"['Costa, CP', 'Leza, M', 'Duennes, MA', 'Fisher, K', 'Vollaro, A', 'Hur, M', 'Kirkwood, JS', 'Woodard, SH']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"A primary goal in biology is to understand the effects of multiple, interacting environmental stressors on organisms. Wild and domesticated bees are exposed to a wide variety of interacting biotic and abiotic stressors, with widespread declines in floral resources and agrochemical exposure being two of the most important. In this study, we used examinations of brain gene expression to explore the sublethal consequences of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and pollen diet composition in nest-founding bumble bee queens. We demonstrate for the first time that pollen diet composition can influence the strength of bumble bee queen responses to pesticide exposure at the molecular level. Specifically, one pollen mixture in our study appeared to buffer bumble bee queens entirely against the effects of pesticide exposure, with respect to brain gene expression. Additionally, we detected unique effects of pollen diet and sustained (versus more temporary) pesticide exposure on queen gene expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that nutritional status can help buffer animals against the harmful effects of other stressors, including pesticides, and highlight the importance of using molecular approaches to explore sublethal consequences of stressors.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155216,833,,0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Therefore, a better understanding on how the availability and quality of pollen diets can modulate honeybee sensitivity to pesticides is required. For that purpose, we evaluated the toxicity of acute exposure and chronic exposures to field realistic and higher concentrations of azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) in honeybees provided with pollen diets of differing qualities (named S and BQ pollens). We found that pollen intake reduced the toxicity of the acute doses of pesticides. Contrary to azoxystrobin, chronic exposures to sulfoxaflor increased by 13- to 12-fold bee mortality, which was reduced by pollen intake. Most importantly, the risk of death upon exposure to a high concentration of sulfoxaflor was significantly lower for the S pollen diet when compared with the BQ pollen diet. This reduced pesticide toxicity was associated with a higher gene expression of vitellogenin, a glycoprotein that promotes bee longevity, a faster sulfoxaflor metabolization and a lower concentration of the phytochemical p-coumaric acid, known to upregulate detoxification enzymes. Thus, our study revealed that pollen quality can influence the ability of bees to metabolize pesticides and withstand their detrimental effects, providing another strong argument for the restoration of suitable foraging habitat.",2021,10.1098/rsos.210818,8,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes. Trialling the framework in our study system, we found that our focal insecticide, thiacloprid, improved red clover seed yield with no detected effects on its key pollinator, B. terrestris, and that the presence of red clover in the landscape can benefit pollinator populations.",2022,10.1111/1365-2664.14244,59,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Polyphenols as food supplement improved food consumption and longevity of honey bees (Apis mellifera) intoxicated by pesticide thiacloprid,643,JOUR,"['Hýbl, M.', 'Mráz, P.', 'Šipoš, J.', 'Hoštičková, I.', 'Bohatá, A.', 'Čurn, V.', 'Kopec, T.']",Insects,"Malnutrition is one of the main problems related to the global mass collapse of honey bee colonies, because in honey bees, malnutrition is associated with deterioration of the immune system and increased pesticide susceptibility. Another important cause of mass bee colonies losses is the use of pesticides. Therefore, the goal of this study was to verify the influence of polyphenols on longevity, food consumption, and cytochrome P450 gene expression in worker bees intoxicated by thiacloprid. The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. © 2021 by the authors.

Population decline in a ground-nesting solitary squash bee (Eucera pruinosa) following exposure to a neonicotinoid insecticide treated crop (Cucurbita pepo),644,JOUR,"['Willis Chan, D.S.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Scientific Reports,"Insect pollinators are threatened by multiple environmental stressors, including pesticide exposure. Despite being important pollinators, solitary ground-nesting bees are inadequately represented by pesticide risk assessments reliant almost exclusively on honeybee ecotoxicology. Here we evaluate the effects of realistic exposure via squash crops treated with systemic insecticides (Admire-imidacloprid soil application, FarMore FI400-thiamethoxam seed-coating, or Coragen-chlorantraniliprole foliar spray) for a ground-nesting bee species (Hoary squash bee, Eucera pruinosa) in a 3-year semi-field experiment. Hoary squash bees provide essential pollination services to pumpkin and squash crops and commonly nest within cropping areas increasing their risk of pesticide exposure from soil, nectar, and pollen. When exposed to a crop treated at planting with soil-applied imidacloprid, these bees initiated 85% fewer nests, left 5.3 times more pollen unharvested, and produced 89% fewer offspring than untreated controls. No measurable impacts on bees from exposure to squash treated with thiamethoxam as a seed-coating or foliage sprayed with chlorantraniliprole were found. Our results demonstrate important sublethal effects of field-realistic exposure to a soil-applied neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bee behaviour and reproductive success. Soil must be considered a potential route of pesticide exposure in risk assessments, and restrictions on soil-applied insecticides may be justified, to mitigate impacts on ground-nesting solitary bee populations and the crop pollination services they provide. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,10.1038/s41598-021-83341-7,11,0.0,0,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of land use on honey bee and stingless bee populations. Research was conducted in Bogor and Malang to compare between two different geographical areas. Managed bees such as honey bees (Apis cerana and A. mellifera) and stingless bees (Tetragonula laeviceps) were investigated to examine the effect of agricultural intensification. Field experiments were conducted by placing beehives in selected habitats (i.e., beekeeper gardens, forests areas, and agriculture areas). Population growth and neonicotinoid residue analysis of bees in different hive locations were measured to study the effect of habitat type. Population growth of bees represents the forager abundance and colony weight. Based on the analysis, we found that habitat type affected forager abundance and colony weight of honey bees (p < 0.05), although the patterns were different between species, region, as well as season.

Positive correlation between pesticide consumption and longevity in solitary bees: Are we overlooking fitness trade-offs?,677,JOUR,"['Strobl, V.', 'Camenzind, D.', 'Minnameyer, A.', 'Walker, S.', 'Eyer, M.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Straub, L.']",Insects,"The ubiquitous use of pesticides is one major driver for the current loss of biodiversity, and the common practice of simultaneously applying multiple agrochemicals may further contribute. Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup® and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival; however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction. The data suggest that a focus on survival can lead to false-negative results and it appears inevitable to include fitness or at least tokens of fitness at the earliest stage in future risk assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that sub-lethal exposure to neurotoxic, neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect pollinator immunocompetence and could amplify the effects of diseases, likely contributing to pollinator declines. However, a direct pathway connecting neonicotinoids and immune functions remains elusive. In this study we show that haemocytes and non-neural tissues of the honeybee Apis mellifera express the building blocks of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are the target of neonicotinoids. In addition, we demonstrate that the haemocytes, which form the cellular arm of the innate immune system, actively express choline acetyltransferase, a key enzyme necessary to synthesize acetylcholine. In a last step, we show that the expression of this key enzyme is affected by field-realistic doses of clothianidin, a widely used neonicotinoid.

"Potential risk to pollinators from neonicotinoid applications to host trees for management of spotted lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae)",17,JOUR,"['Elmquist, J.', 'Biddinger, D.', 'Phan, N.T.', 'Moural, T.W.', 'Zhu, F.', 'Hoover, K.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are used to manage spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula (White); hereafter SLF), a recently introduced pest in the United States. Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)), then compared these RQs to a level of concern. For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees.

"Potential source of ecofriendly insecticides: Essential oil induces avoidance and cause lower impairment on the activity of a stingless bee than organosynthetic insecticides, in laboratory",665,JOUR,"['Matos, W.B.', 'Santos, A.C.C.', 'Lima, A.P.S.', 'Santana, E.D.R.', 'Silva, J.E.', 'Blank, A.F.', 'Araújo, A.P.A.', 'Bacci, L.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The negative effect of insecticides on bees has been reported as one of the factors associated with the decline in population of these pollinators. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of the stingless bee Nannotrigona aff. testaceicornis (Lepeletier, 1836) to a promising source of new insecticide molecules obtained from Lippia sidoides (rosemary pepper) essential oil (EO) and its major compounds (thymol, ρ-cymene, and (E)-caryophyllene), comparing them to commercial insecticides (organosynthetic: imidacloprid, deltamethrin and semisynthetic: spinetoram). For this, stingless bees were exposed by contact with these compounds to evaluate the lethal and sublethal (locomotion and flight orientation) toxicity. The L. sidoides EO and its major compounds have low lethal toxicity to forager worker bees (N. aff. testaceicornis). The organosynthetics imidacloprid (LD50 = 0.00146 µg bee−1) and deltamethrin (LD50 = 0.0096 µg bee−1) were about 209,589 and 31,875 times more toxic, respectively, than the least toxic natural compound, (E)-caryophyllene (LD50 = 306 µg bee−1). Locomotion ability and flight orientation were little affected by spinetoram and by L. sidoides EO and its major compounds, however, were greatly reduced by the imidacloprid and deltamethrin insecticides. Besides shows low lethal and sublethal toxicity, the bioinsecticides were also avoided by the forager bees. Individuals treated with the L. sidoides EO and thymol were avoided by the untreated bees. Therefore, the natural products studied here were promising due to their recognized effectiveness against pest insects and greater safety to bees N. aff. testaceicornis. © 2020 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111764,209,,0,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Programmed Cell Death in the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Worker Brain Induced by Imidacloprid,925,JOUR,"['Wu, Y.-Y.', 'Zhou, T.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Dai, P.-L.', 'Xu, S.-F.', 'Jia, H.-R.', 'Wang, X.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Honey bees are at an unavoidable risk of exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are used worldwide. Compared with the well-studied roles of these pesticides in nontarget site (including midgut, ovary, or salivary glands), little has been reported in the target sites, the brain. In the current study, laboratory-reared adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL technique for DNA labeling. We observed significantly increased apoptotic markers in dose- and time-dependent manners in brains of bees exposed to imidacloprid. Neuronal activated caspase-3 and mRNA levels of caspase-1, as detected by immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively, were significantly increased, suggesting that sublethal doses of imidacloprid may induce the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the overlap of apoptosis and autophagy in neurons was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It further suggests that a relationship exists between neurotoxicity and behavioral changes induced by sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that there is a need to determine reasonable limits for imidacloprid application in the field to protect pollinators. © The Authors 2015.

Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor,544,JOUR,"['Shi, T.', 'Meng, L.', 'Jiang, X.', 'Cao, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022,10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105168,186,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,
Quantitative correlation between molecular similarity and receptor-binding activity of neonicotinoid insecticides,433,JOUR,"['Nakayama, A', 'Sukekawa, M']",PESTICIDE SCIENCE,"Quantitative correlation between molecular similarity and receptor-binding activity of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid and acetamiprid was studied by using a method of similarity index and semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations. A series of compounds having an aromatic ring and a cyclic or acyclic amine moiety with an electron-withdrawing group were subjected to the similarity-activity analysis. Energy-minimum structures and electrostatic properties of the molecules were obtained by MNDO-PM3. The electrostatic similarity of each molecule compared with the most active compounds was found to correlate significantly with the binding activity to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in honey bee when the two molecules were superimposed to maximize the molecular shape similarity by simplex procedure. This indicates that molecular similarity in terms of electrostatic properties is important for activity, as well as superimposability in terms of molecular shape, A schematic model of interaction between neonicotinoids and nAChR is proposed according to the results of similarity-activity analyses.

Queen bee acceptance under threat: Neurotoxic insecticides provoke deep damage in queen-worker relationships,779,JOUR,"['Otesbelgue, A.', 'dos Santos, C.F.', 'Blochtein, B.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Virgin queens (gynes) exhibit a range of behaviors in order to be accepted as the leader of colony. However, environmental neurotoxic insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the larval food of queens from Plebeia droryana, a species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers. Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression) from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.048,166,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Quinuclidine compounds differently act as agonists of Kenyon cell nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and induced distinct effect on insect ganglionic depolarizations,536,JOUR,"['Mathé-Allainmat, M', 'Swale, D', 'Leray, X', 'Benzidane, Y', 'Lebreton, J', 'Bloomquist, JR', 'Thany, SH']",INVERTEBRATE NEUROSCIENCE,"We have recently demonstrated that a new quinuclidine benzamide compound named LMA10203 acted as an agonist of insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Its specific pharmacological profile on cockroach dorsal unpaired median neurons (DUM) helped to identify alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive nAChR2 receptors. In the present study, we tested its effect on cockroach Kenyon cells. We found that it induced an inward current demonstrating that it bounds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on Kenyon cells. Interestingly, LMA10203-induced currents were completely blocked by the nicotinic antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin. We suggested that LMA10203 effect occurred through the activation of alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive receptors and did not involve alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive nAChR2, previously identified in DUM neurons. In addition, we have synthesized two new compounds, LMA10210 and LMA10211, and compared their effects on Kenyon cells. These compounds were members of the 3-quinuclidinyl benzamide or benzoate families. Interestingly, 1 mM LMA10210 was not able to induce an inward current on Kenyon cells compared to LMA10211. Similarly, we did not find any significant effect of LMA10210 on cockroach ganglionic depolarization, whereas these three compounds were able to induce an effect on the central nervous system of the third instar M. domestica larvae.

RFID tracking of sublethal effects of two neonicotinoid insecticides on the foraging behavior of Apis mellifera,982,JOUR,"['Schneider, C.W.', 'Tautz, J.', 'Grünewald, B.', 'Fuchs, S.']",PLoS ONE,"The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ≥0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ≥1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides. © 2012 Schneider et al.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0030023,7,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,
RNA-seq reveals disruption of gene regulation when honey bees are caged and deprived of hive conditions,774,JOUR,"['Alburaki, M.', 'Karim, S.', 'Lamour, K.', 'Adamczyk, J.', 'Stewart, S.D.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"In this study, we present phenotypic and genetic data characterizing the impact of imidacloprid and caging stress on honey bee Apis mellifera physiological responses and regulation of 45 genes using targeted-RNA seq. The term ‘caging stress’ characterizes the effects of depriving honey bees of all hive aspects and conditions. Two cohorts of 1 day old sister bees were subjected to different conditions. One cohort was caged and fed different imidacloprid-tainted sugar solutions and the second was marked and introduced back to its natal hive. Physiological bee parameters and diet behavior were monitored daily for caged bees over several weeks. Bee samples from both cohorts were sampled weekly for RNA sequencing and oxidative stress analyses. Imidacloprid induced significant protein damage and post-ingestive aversion responses in caged bees, leading to lower tainted syrup consumption and higher water intake compared with the controls. No differentially expressed genes were observed among caged bees in regards to imidacloprid treatment. However, significant upregulation in antioxidant genes was recorded in caged bees as compared with hive bees, with overwhelming downregulation in all gene categories in caged bees at week 4. We identified two sets of genes that were constantly regulated in caged bees, including Rsod with unknown function in insects that could potentially characterize caging stress in honey bees. © 2019.

To explore the molecular mechanisms of neonicotinoid toxicity to bees, the different binding modes of imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and flupyradifurone with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α1β1 and cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3) were studied using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. These mechanisms provided a basis for the design of compounds with a potential low bee toxicity. Consequently, we designed and synthesized a series of triazinone derivatives and assessed their bioassays. Among them, compound 5a not only displayed substantially insecticidal activities against Aphis glycines (LC50 = 4.40 mg/L) and Myzus persicae (LC50 = 6.44 mg/L) but also had low toxicity to Apis mellifera. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings further confirmed that compound 5a interacted with the M. persicae nAChR α1 subunit but not with the A. mellifera nAChR α1 subunit.

Re-using food resources from failed honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies and their impact on colony queen rearing capacity,471,JOUR,"['Tokach, R.', 'Smart, A.', 'Wu-Smart, J.']",Scientific Reports,"For over a decade, beekeepers have experienced high losses of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies due to a variety of stressors including pesticide exposure. Some of these chemical stressors may residually remain in the colony comb and food resources (pollen and nectar) of failed colonies and be later re-used by beekeepers when splitting and building back new colonies. The practice of re-using comb from previously perished colonies (termed “deadout”) is common in beekeeping practice, but its role in affecting colony health is not well understood. Here, we evaluate the impact of reused, pesticide-contaminated “deadout” combs on colony function during the process of replacing a queen bee. Queenless microcolonies were established to monitor queen rearing capacity in two treatment groups: (1) colonies given frames containing food resources from deadout colonies in control “clean” apiaries and, (2) colonies given frames containing “contaminated” resources from deadout colonies originating from apiaries experiencing chronic pesticide exposure from widespread systemic pesticide pollution (including neonicotinoid insecticides: clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Results indicate that colonies given pesticide-contaminated resources produced fewer queen cells per colony and had a lower proportion of colonies successfully raising a functional, diploid egg-laying queen. This research highlights the deleterious effects of re-using deadout combs from colonies previously lost due to pesticide contamination. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.",2023,10.1038/s41598-023-44037-2,13,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Real-time monitoring of honeybee colony daily activity and bee loss rates can highlight the risk posed by a pesticide,453,JOUR,"['Barascou, L.', 'Godeau, U.', 'Pioz, M.', 'Martin, O.', 'Sené, D.', 'Crauser, D.', 'Le Conte, Y.', 'Alaux, C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Information on honeybee foraging performance and especially bee loss rates at the colony level are crucial for evaluating the magnitude of effects due to pesticide exposure, thereby ensuring that protection goals for honeybee colonies are met (i.e. threshold of acceptable effects). However, current methods for monitoring honeybee foraging activity and mortality are very approximate (visual records) or are time-limited and mostly based on single cohort analysis. We therefore assess the potential of bee counters, that enable a colony-level and continuous monitoring of bee flight activity and mortality, in pesticide risk assessment. After assessing the background activity and bee loss rates, we exposed colonies to two concentrations of sulfoxaflor (a neurotoxic insecticide) in sugar syrup: a concentration that was considered to be field realistic (0.59 μg/ml) and a higher concentration (2.36 μg/ml) representing a worst-case exposure scenario. We did not find any effect of the field-realistic concentration on flight activity and bee loss rates. However, a two-fold decrease in daily flight activity and a 10-fold increase in daily bee losses were detected in colonies exposed to the highest sulfoxaflor concentration as compared to before exposure. When compared to the theoretical trigger values associated with the specific protection goal of 7 % colony-size reduction, the observed fold changes in daily bee losses were often found to be at risk for colonies. In conclusion, the real-time and colony-level monitoring of bee loss rates, combined with threshold values indicating at which levels bee loss rates threaten the colony, have great potential for improving regulatory pesticide risk assessments for honeybees under field conditions. © 2023",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163928,886,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Reconciling laboratory and field assessments of neonicotinoid toxicity to honeybees,930,JOUR,"['Henry, M.', 'Cerrutti, N.', 'Aupinel, P.', 'Decourtye, A.', 'Gayrard, M.', 'Odoux, J.-F.', 'Pissard, A.', 'Rüger, C.', 'Bretagnolle, V.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"European governments have banned the use of three common neonicotinoid pesticides due to insufficiently identified risks to bees. This policy decision is controversial given the absence of clear consistency between toxicity assessments of those substances in the laboratory and in the field. Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies’ demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures. This study reconciles the conflicting laboratory and field toxicity assessments of neonicotinoids on honeybees and further highlights the difficulty in actually detecting non-intentional effects on the field through conventional risk assessment methods. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Reduced species richness of native bees in field margins associated with neonicotinoid concentrations in non-target soils,729,JOUR,"['Main, A.R.', 'Webb, E.B.', 'Goyne, K.W.', 'Mengel, D.']","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Native bees are in decline as many species are sensitive to habitat loss, climate change, and non-target exposure to synthetic pesticides. Recent laboratory and semi-field assessments of pesticide impacts on bees have focused on neonicotinoid insecticides. However, field studies evaluating influences of neonicotinoid seed treatments on native bee communities of North America are absent from the literature. On four Conservation Areas of Missouri, we sampled row-cropped (treated, n = 15) and reference (untreated, n = 9) agricultural fields, and their surrounding field margins for neonicotinoids in soil and non-target vegetation (i.e., native wildflowers). Wildflowers were further collected and screened for the presence of fungicides. Concurrently, we sampled native bees over three discrete time points throughout the agricultural growing season to assess potential impacts of seed treatment use on local bee populations over time. Neonicotinoids were detected in 87% to 100% of treated field soils and 22% to 56% of reference field soils. In adjacent field margin soils, quantifiable concentrations were measured near treated (53% to 93% detection) and untreated fields (33% to 56% detection). Fungicides were detected in < 40% of wildflowers, whereas neonicotinoids were rarely detected in field margin vegetation (< 7%). Neonicotinoid concentrations in margin soils were negatively associated with native bee richness (β = −0.21, P < 0.05). Field margins with a combination of greater neonicotinoid concentrations in soil and fungicides in wildflowers also contained fewer wild bee species (β = −0.21, P < 0.001). By comparison, bee abundance was positively influenced by the number of wildflower species in bloom with no apparent impact of pesticides. Results of this study indicate that neonicotinoids in soil are a potential route of exposure for pollinator communities, specifically ground-nesting species. Importantly, native bee richness in non-target field margins may be negatively affected by the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in agroecosystems. © 2019",2020,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106693,287,1.0,1,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT50s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides,969,JOUR,"['Matsumoto, T.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid.",2013,,66,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

The repellency study was carried out in a large-scale field trial in SE Norway in 2013. On average for observations during the first week after spraying, 17 and 40% less honey bees (P =.03) and 26 and 20% less bumble bees (P =.36) were observed on plots sprayed with the pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and alpha-cypermethrin, respectively, than on unsprayed control plots. No pollinator repellency was found on plots sprayed with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Compared with unsprayed control the seed yield increases were 22% on plots sprayed with thiacloprid vs. 12–13% on plots sprayed with pyrethroids (P =.10). Follow-up studies in 2014–2016 focused on the effect of thiacloprid on bumble bee colony development in commercially reared nests of Bombus terrestris placed into red clover seed crops at the start of flowering. Unsprayed control crops were compared with crops sprayed either at the bud stage or when 18–44% of flower heads were in full bloom. Chemical analyses of adult bumble bees showed that thiacloprid was taken up in bees when crops were sprayed during flowering, but not detected when crops were sprayed at the bud stage. The bumble bees in late-sprayed crops also developed weaker colonies than in unsprayed crops. Dead bees with a high internal concentration of thiacloprid were found in one crop sprayed during the night at 35% flowering. This shows that thiacloprid is not bee-safe if sprayed after anthesis and that spraying has to be conducted at the bud stage to reduce its contamination of nectar and pollen. © 2019, © 2019 Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO).",2019,10.1080/09064710.2019.1596301,69,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Repression and recuperation of brood production in Bombus terrestris bumble bees exposed to a pulse of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid,968,JOUR,"['Laycock, I.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",PLoS ONE,"Currently, there is concern about declining bee populations and some blame the residues of neonicotinoid pesticides in the nectar and pollen of treated crops. Bumble bees are important wild pollinators that are widely exposed to dietary neonicotinoids by foraging in agricultural environments. In the laboratory, we tested the effect of a pulsed exposure (14 days 'on dose' followed by 14 days 'off dose') to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on the amount of brood (number of eggs and larvae) produced by Bombus terrestris L. bumble bees in small, standardised experimental colonies (a queen and four adult workers). During the initial 'on dose' period we observed a dose-dependent repression of brood production in colonies, with productivity decreasing as dosage increased up to 98 μg kg-1 dietary imidacloprid. During the following 'off dose' period, colonies showed a dose-dependent recuperation such that total brood production during the 28-day pulsed exposure was not correlated with imidacloprid up to 98 μg kg-1. Our findings raise further concern about the threat to wild bumble bees from neonicotinoids, but they also indicate some resilience to a pulsed exposure, such as that arising from the transient bloom of a treated mass-flowering crop. © 2013 Laycock, Cresswell.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0079872,8,,0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Reproductive fitness of honey bee queens exposed to thiamethoxam during development,642,JOUR,"['Kozii, I.V.', 'Barnsley, S.', 'Silva, M.C.B.D.', 'Wood, S.C.', 'Klein, C.D.', 'de Mattos, I.M.', 'Zabrodski, M.W.', 'Silva, R.D.C.M.', 'Fabela, C.I.O.', 'Guillemin, L.', 'Dvylyuk, I.', 'Ferrari, M.C.O.', 'Simko, E.']",Veterinary Pathology,"The productivity and survival of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies depend on queen bee health. Colony-level neonicotinoid exposure has negative effects on reproductive fitness of honey bee queens. However, it is unclear if the observed effects are a direct outcome of neonicotinoid toxicity or result from suboptimal care of developing queens by exposed workers. The aim of this study was to evaluate larval survival, reproductive fitness, and histopathology of honey bee queens exposed to incremental doses (0, 5, 50 ng) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (THI) applied directly to individual late larvae (7 days post-oviposition) of queens. The 5 ng dose represents a calculated high environmental level of exposure for honey bee queen larvae. Morphometric evaluation revealed that the total area of mandibular gland epithelium in queens exposed to 5 and 50 ng THI was reduced by 14% (P =.12) and 25% (P =.001), respectively. Decreased mandibular gland size may alter pheromone production, which could in part explain previously observed negative effects of THI on the reproductive fitness of queens. We also found that late larval exposure to THI reduced larval and pupal survival and decreased sperm viability in mated queens. These changes may interfere with queen development and reproductive longevity. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,10.1177/03009858211031845,58,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,
"Residual determination and acute toxicity of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the neotropical stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula Latreille, 1811 (Apidae: Meliponini)",438,JOUR,"['Biscassi, G.F.', 'Rabêlo, W.F.', 'Sardeli, R.', 'Rodrigues Garcia, G.R.', 'Brigante, J.', 'Daam, M.A.', 'José dos Santos Neto, Á.', 'Moscardi dos Santos, D.', 'Vieira, E.M.']",Chemosphere,"Bees play a crucial role as natural pollinators, ensuring the maintenance and stability of the world's biodiversity and agricultural crops. Native bees in neotropical regions belong to the Meliponini tribe, a larger group that differs significantly in behavior and biology from honeybees (e.g., Apis mellifera) and solitary bees (e.g., Osmia spp.). Hence, the exposure and effects of pesticides is also likely to vary among these different species. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to determine the presence of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the Brazilian native stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula (local common name: Jataí). The method used for the chemical analysis involved a QuEChERS technique combined with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The developed method was subsequently used to analyze collected field samples. In addition, the acute toxicity of the pesticide to T. angustula was evaluated in a laboratory bioassay evaluating both lethal and sublethal endpoints. The analytical method was successfully developed with detection and quantification limits of 1.55 and 5 μg L−1, respectively, along with a linear range of 1–5 ng mL−1. Clothianidin was detected in environmental samples (9.2–32.9 ng g−1), and the exposure experiments demonstrated acute oral toxicity to adults of T. angustula, (24 h-LD50 of 0.16 ng a.i./bee), as well as no significative interference in acetylcholinesterase activity. Considering the obtained toxicity endpoints for T. angustula and those reported in the literature for other bee species, this study revealed that T. angustula is more (lethally) sensitive to clothianidin than other bee species, including those commonly used in environmental risk assessment studies. This thus also supports the call for using native test species in (regional) risk assessment evaluations. © 2023",2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140878,349,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year. All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples. No negative effects of neonicotinoids on the bee mortality, brood development, strength, and honey yield of healthy bee colonies were found throughout the study period.

Responses of honey bees to lethal and sublethal doses of formulated clothianidin alone and mixtures,799,JOUR,"['Yao, J.', 'Zhu, Y.C.', 'Adamczyk, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has sparked concern over the toxicity risk to honey bees (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + λ -cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%. The LC 50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient, which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee (LD 50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 μl per bee per day. In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC 50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville (MS, United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations, clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2018.",2018,10.1093/jee/toy140,111,,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10,,0,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,
Risk assessment for side-effects of neonicotinoids against bumblebees with and without impairing foraging behavior,998,JOUR,"['Mommaerts, V.', 'Reynders, S.', 'Boulet, J.', 'Besard, L.', 'Sterk, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Ecotoxicology,"Bombus terrestris bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers, and in modern agriculture they are used to guarantee pollination of vegetables and fruits. In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2010,10.1007/s10646-009-0406-2,19,,0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

A wide variety of insecticides are used to manage D. citri populations within citrus groves in Florida. However, in areas shared by citrus growers and beekeepers the use of insecticides may increase the risks of Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) loss and contaminated honey. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri. Diflubenzuron was not toxic to A. mellifera in the field as compared with untreated control plots. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity of A. mellifera was higher than in untreated controls when A. mellifera were exposed to 14 days old residues. The results indicate that diflubenzuron may be safe to apply in citrus when A. mellifera are foraging, while most insecticides used for management of D. citri in citrus are likely hazardous under various exposure scenarios.",2017,10.1007/s10646-017-1768-5,26,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,

Only the parent compound and no metabolites were detected in nectar and pollen of these seed-treated sunflower plants (limit of detection <0.001 mg kg-1). In standard LD50 laboratory tests, imidacloprid showed high oral toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera), with LD50 values between 3.7 and 40.9 ng per bee, corresponding to a lethal food concentration between 0.14 and 1.57 mg kg-1. The residue level of imidacloprid in nectar and pollen of seed-treated sunflower plants in the field was negligible. Under field-growing conditions no residues were detected (limit of detection: 0.0015 mg kg-1) in either nectar or pollen. There were also no detectable residues in nectar and pollen of sunflowers planted as a succeeding crop in soils which previously had been cropped with imidacloprid seed-treated plants. Chronic feeding experiments with sunflower honey fortified with 0.002, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.020 mg kg-1 imidacloprid were conducted to assess potential long-term adverse effects on honeybee colonies. Testing end-points in this 39-day feeding study were mortality, feeding activity, wax/comb production, breeding performance and colony vitality. Even at the highest test concentration, imidacloprid showed no adverse effects on the development of the exposed bee colonies. This no-adverse-effect concentration of 0.020 mg kg-1 compares with a field residue level of less than 0.0015 mg kg-1 (= limit of detection in the field residue studies) which clearly shows that a sunflower seed dressing with imidacloprid poses no risk to honeybees.

S-dinotefuran affects the social behavior of honeybees (Apis mellifera)and increases their risk in the colony,477,JOUR,"['Zhang, F.', 'Cao, W.', 'Zhang, Y.', 'Luo, J.', 'Hou, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Yi, G.', 'Li, H.', 'Huang, M.', 'Dong, L.', 'Li, X.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"The toxic effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honeybees is a global concern, whereas little is known about the effect of stereoisomeric pesticides among honeybee social behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of stereoisomeric dinotefuran on honeybee social behavior. We found that honeybees exhibit a preference for consuming food containing S-dinotefuran, actively engage in trophallaxis with S-dinotefuran–consuming peers, and consequently acquire higher levels of S-dinotefuran compared with R-dinotefuran. In comparison to R-dinotefuran, S-dinotefuran stimulates honeybees to elevate their body temperature, thereby attracting more peers for trophallaxis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of thermogenesis pathways due to S-dinotefuran exposure. Additionally, metabolome data indicated that S-dinotefuran may enhance body temperature by promoting lipid synthesis in the lysine degradation pathway. Consequently, body temperature emerges as a key factor influencing honeybee social behavior. Our study is the first to highlight the propensity of S-dinotefuran to raise honeybee body temperature, which prompts honeybee to preferentially engage in trophallaxis with peers exhibiting higher body temperatures. This preference may lead honeybees to collect more dinotefuran-contaminated food in the wild, significantly accelerating dinotefuran transmission within a population. Proactive trophallaxis further amplifies the risk of neonicotinoid pesticide transmission within a population, making honeybees that have consumed S-dinotefuran particularly favored within their colonies. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the higher risk associated with neonicotinoid use compared with other pesticides. © 2023",2023,10.1016/j.pestbp.2023.105594,196,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,
"SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF NEONICOTINOID APPLICATION IN RICE FIELDS, ON THE MORTALITY AND COLONY COLLAPSE OF HONEYBEES (APIS MELLIFERA)",124,JOUR,"['Matsumoto, T']",JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE,"Declines in honeybee (Allis mellifera) colonies have elicited great concern worldwide. Recently, many Japanese beekeepers have implied that midsummer use of a new insecticide, neonicotinoid, in rice fields, is causing widespread mortality of neighboring honeybees and frequently resulting in colony collapse. Since few field experiments have directly tested the effects of neonicotinoids, I addressed four research questions in the field. The questions are: 1) Does clothianidin application in rice fields cause the collapse of neighboring honeybee colonies? 2) Is colony collapse related to hive distance from the rice field? 3) Is the number of dead honeybee workers after spraying, related to hive distance from the field? 4) What are the long-term effects of neonicotinoid use on honeybee colony growth, especially brood production? In the late summer of 2010, honeybee hives were placed adjacent to two separate rice fields for 1 week. The hives were placed at the distance of 0, 30, 60, and 90 m. After spraying clothianidin, a daily count of dead worker honeybees was done for a week. Hives were weighed, and capped-brood areas were estimated weekly, for 2 months following insecticide application. Although the average number of dead workers ranged from 40 to over 100 within 24 hours after spraying, only a few dead workers were observed in the subsequent days. Distance from the rice field had no significant effect on the number of dead workers. There were no collapsed colonies during the 2-month, post-spray observation period. Hive weight and capped-brood area did not significantly differ among those hives placed at varying distances from the rice field. These results indicated that clothianidin spraying of the rice field increased the mortality of the honeybees, but did not always cause colony collapse.",2013,10.2478/JAS-2013-0014,57,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

Screening and Optimization of Novel Low Bee-Toxicity Phenylacetohydrazone Compounds Based on Insect nAChR Selectivity,247,JOUR,"['Yang, ZK', 'Wu, X', 'Zhang, JL', 'Lu, XX', 'Li, X', 'Jiang, ZY', 'Song, DL', 'Duan, HX', 'Yang, XL']",CHINESE JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY,"Increasing numbers of neonicotinoids have recently been banned by the European Union (EU) and the United States of America (USA) due to their potential high risk to pollinating bees. In this work, a phenylacetohydrazone compound VS-04 was found via scaffold hopping to exert good mortality rate against soybean aphids based on a double combinational strategy of virtual screening and bioassay technique. The molecular interaction mode to honeybee nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) for the newly found compound VS-04 obviously differed from that of the known imidacloprid. The newly synthesized phenylacetohydrazone compounds 3c and 3e caused soybean aphids to have a moderate mortality rate of approximately 70% at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. Importantly, the bee-toxicity study confirmed that compounds 3c and 3e showed much lower acute contact toxicity with LD50 value (30.35 and 124.4 mu g/bee) of 3 similar to 4 orders of magnitude than that of imidacloprid (0.019 mu g/bee). The hydrazone substructure of compound 3c was found to be a L-shape low-energy conformation confirmed by a crystal structure of its analog 3m and inversely point toward a subunit of honeybee receptor via a molecular interaction study, indicating its potential low bee-toxicity. Compounds 4f and 4g (optimized derivatives of 3e) indeed showed better insecticidal activity against soybean aphids with moderate LC50 values of 83.42 and 66.44 mu g/mL, respectively, compared with 3e (147.30 mu g/mL).

Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees,606,JOUR,"['Tsvetkov, N.', 'Zayed, A.']",Ecology and Evolution,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a “streetlight effect” where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways; foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. © 2021 The Authors.

Secondary biomarkers of insecticide-induced stress of honey bee colonies and their relevance for overwintering strength,890,JOUR,"['Wegener, J.', 'Ruhnke, H.', 'Milchreit, K.', 'Kleebaum, K.', 'Franke, M.', 'Mispagel, S.', 'Bischoff, G.', 'Kamp, G.', 'Bienefeld, K.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"The evaluation of pesticide side-effects on honeybees is hampered by a lack of colony-level bioassays that not only are sensitive to physiological changes, but also allow predictions about the consequences of exposure for longer-term colony productivity and survival. Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8–64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24 h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering. Our study therefore illustrates the difficulties involved in evaluating the economic/ecological significance of pesticide-induced stress in honey bee field studies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.06.038,132,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,
Seed coating with a neonicotinoid insecticide negatively affects wild bees,937,JOUR,"['Rundlöf, M.', 'Andersson, G.K.S.', 'Bommarco, R.', 'Fries, I.', 'Hederström, V.', 'Herbertsson, L.', 'Jonsson, O.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Pedersen, T.R.', 'Yourstone, J.', 'Smith, H.G.']",Nature,"Understanding the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees is vital because of reported declines in bee diversity and distribution and the crucial role bees have as pollinators in ecosystems and agriculture. Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid β-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees. ©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Seed treatment with neonicotinoid insecticides does not affect the foraging behavior of honey bees,507,JOUR,"['Chandrakumara, K.', 'Muralimohan, K.', 'S, A.H.', 'Gundoju, S.', 'Belavadi, V.V.', 'Ramanappa, T.M.']",Apidologie,"The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides in the agricultural ecosystems is said to be one of the causes for the alarming bee decline observed around the world. However, the evidences against neonicotinoids are inconclusive. In this study, we assessed the impact of neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), when applied as seed treatment and foliar sprays, on the foraging activity of honey bees. When applied as seed treatment, residues of the tested molecules in the pollen and nectar samples were present below quantifiable levels (< LOQ). At 3 days after spraying, residues of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were 0.86 and 0.96 mg/kg in the leaf samples, 0.15 and 0.23 mg/kg in the pollen samples, and 0.07 and 0.07 mg/kg in the nectar samples, respectively. Further, the foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment. Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application. Nonetheless, the foraging activity was comparable to the control levels 7 days after spraying. It appears that there is little short-term impact of neonicotinoids on the foraging activity of bees, especially when applied as seed treatment. © 2023, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s13592-023-01007-x,54,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,
Sensitivity of Buff-Tailed Bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) to Insecticides with Different Mode of Action,595,JOUR,"['Cabezas, G.', 'Farinós, G.P.']",Insects,"Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of the worldwide bee decline as they are exposed to them through multiple pathways. Specifically, neonicotinoids, some of which are banned for outdoor use in the European Union (EU), have been pointed out as a major cause of bee collapse. Thus, farmers have had to look for alternatives for pest control and use known insecticides or new substances reportedly less harmful to bees. We evaluated the oral acute toxicity of six insecticides (three of them systemic: imidacloprid, thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor) with four different modes of action on buff-tailed bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris): two banned neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid), two pyrethroids (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate), one sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) and a microbial insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, present in genetically modified (Bt) maize. The microbial insecticide only caused mortality to bumblebee workers at extremely high concentrations, so it is expected that Bt maize does not pose a risk to them. The toxicity of the other five insecticides on bumblebees was, from highest to lowest: imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and thiacloprid. This outcome suggests that certain insecticides in use are more toxic to B. terrestris than some banned neonicotinoids. Further chronic toxicity studies, under realistic conditions, are necessary for a proper risk assessment. © 2022 by the authors.

Sensitivity to imidacloprid insecticide varies among some social and solitary bee species of agricultural value,514,JOUR,"['Sampson, B.', 'Gregorc, A.', 'Alburaki, M.', 'Werle, C.', 'Karim, S.', 'Adamczyk, J.', 'Knight, P.']",PLoS ONE,"Pollinator health risks from long-lasting neonicotinoid insecticides like imidacloprid has primarily focused on commercially managed, cavity-nesting bees in the genera Apis, Bombus, and Osmia. We expand these assessments to include 12 species of native and non-native crop pollinators of differing levels of body size, sociality, and floral specialization. Bees were collected throughout 2016 and 2017 from flowering blueberry, squash, pumpkin, sunflower and okra in south Mississippi, USA. Within 30-60 minutes of capture, bees were installed in bioassay cages made from transparent plastic cups and dark amber jars. Bees were fed via dental wicks saturated with 27% (1.25 M) sugar syrup containing a realistic range of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 5, 20, or 100 ppb) that are often found in nectar. Bees displayed no visible tremors or convulsions except for a small sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, and only at 100ppb syrup. Imidacloprid shortened the captive longevities of the solitary bees. Tolerant bee species lived ∼10 to 12 days in the bioassays and included two social and one solitary species: Halictus ligatus, Apis mellifera and Ptilothrix bombiformis (rose mallow bees), respectively. No other bee species tolerated imidacloprid as well as honey bees did, which exhibited no appreciable mortality and only modest paralysis across concentration. In contrast, native bees either lived shorter lives, experienced longer paralysis, or endured both. Overall, longevity decreased with concentration linearly for social bees and non-linearly for solitary species. The percentage of a bee's captive lifespan spent paralyzed increased logarithmically with concentration for all species, although bumble bees suffered longest. Of greatest concern was comparable debilitation of agriculturally valuable solitary bees at both low and high sublethal rates of imidacloprid. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

Short-term lab assessments and microcolonies are insufficient for the risk assessment of insecticides for bees,648,JOUR,"['Van Oystaeyen, A.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Petit, C.', 'Lenaerts, N.', 'Wäckers, F.']",Chemosphere,"Risk assessment studies addressing effects of agrochemicals on bumblebees frequently use microcolonies. These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128518,273,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,

With regard to the widespread use of pesticides in agricultural lands, honey bees, as non-target and useful insect, inadvertently contact these chemicals. Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of some pesticides, the toxicity of three insecticides from different chemical classes including imidacloprid (0.16 mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47 mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500 mg a.i./l) on detoxifying enzymes of worker honey bees and mortality of immature bees was investigated. These chemicals were selected because they are used globally and ingested by honey bees. The sub-lethal concentration of imidacloprid reduced the activity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Exposure to the sub-lethal concentrations of the ethion reduced the esterase (EST) activities in treated honey bees. Exposure of honey bee larvae to imidacloprid (0.16 mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47 mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500 mg a.i./l) increased the mortality of the treated group compared to untreated controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that imidacloprid and ethion disrupt the physiology of honey bees, thereby reducing the efficiency of this beneficial pollinator. Also, it is important that additional studies be performed to investigate the sub-lethal effects of pesticides on larval development. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00910-z,53,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,

Thus, the goal of this work was assess the toxic effects of thiamethoxam on newly emerged worker bees of Apis mellifera (africanized honeybee-AHB). Initially, we determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of thiamethoxam was 4.28 ng a.i./μL of diet. To determine the lethal time 50 (LT50), a survival assay was conducted using diets containing sublethal doses of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 and 1/100 of the LC50. The group of bees exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 had a 41.2% reduction of lifespan. When AHB samples were analyzed by morphological technique we found the presence of condensed cells in the mushroom bodies and optical lobes in exposed honeybees. Through Xylidine Ponceau technique, we found cells which stained more intensely in groups exposed to thiamethoxam. The digestive and regenerative cells of the midgut from exposed bees also showed morphological and histochemical alterations, like cytoplasm vacuolization, increased apocrine secretion and increased cell elimination. Thus, intoxication with a sublethal doses of thiamethoxam can cause impairment in the brain and midgut of AHB and contribute to the honeybee lifespan reduction. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014,10.1002/tox.21842,29,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

After oral application, acetamiprid and deltamethrin at the concentrations used were not able to impair learning sessions. When the retention tests were performed 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h after learning, we found a significant difference between bees after learning sessions when drugs were applied 24 h before learning. Deltamethrin-treated bees were found to be more sensitive at 10 ng/bee and 100 ng/bee doses compared to acetamiprid-treated bees, only with amounts of 100 ng/bee and at 6 h and 24 h delays. When insecticides were applied during learning sessions, none of the tested insecticides was able to impair learning performance at 10 ng/bee or 100 ng/bee but retention performance was altered 24 h after learning sessions. Acetamiprid was the only one to impair retrieval at 10 ng/bee, whereas at 100 ng/bee an impairment of retrieval was found with both insecticides.

Single and combined exposure to 'bee safe' pesticides alter behaviour and offspring production in a ground-nesting solitary bee (Xenoglossa pruinosa),437,JOUR,"['Rondeau, S.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Mounting evidence supporting the negative impacts of exposure to neonicotinoids on bees has prompted the registration of novel 'bee-friendly' insecticides for agricultural use. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a butenolide insecticide that shares the same mode of action as neonicotinoids and has been assessed to be 'practically non-toxic to adult honeybees' using current risk assessment procedures. However, these assessments overlook some routes of exposure specific to wild bees, such as contact with residues in soil for ground-nesters. Co-exposure with other pesticides may also lead to detrimental synergistic effects. In a fully crossed experiment, we assessed the possible lethal and sublethal effects of chronic exposure to two pesticides used on Cucurbita crops, the insecticide Sivanto Prime (FPF) and the fungicide Quadris Top (azoxystrobin and difenoconazole), alone or combined, on solitary ground-nesting squash bees (Xenoglossa pruinosa). Squash bees exposed to Quadris Top collected less pollen per flower visit, while Sivanto-exposed bees produced larger offspring. Pesticide co-exposure induced hyperactivity in female squash bees relative to both the control and single pesticide exposure, and reduced the number of emerging offspring per nest compared to individual pesticide treatments. This study demonstrates that 'low-toxicity' pesticides can adversely affect squash bees under field-realistic exposure, alone or in combination.  © 2024 The Authors.",2024,10.1098/rspb.2023.2939,291,0.0,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

There is no single cause for the colony losses, but many contributing stressors may act in concert. Varroa destructor infestation is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses. The roles of infestation by Nosema ceranae or exposure to insecticides are controversial. Interactions between exposure to pesticides and V. destructor or Nosema spp. have previously been implicated. In two years of field experiments, we studied the effects of and possible interactions between the stressors V. destructor infestation, Nosema spp. infestation, and chronic sublethal exposure to a field-realistic dose of the insecticide imidacloprid on the performance and survival of honey bee colonies. Colonies highly infested by V. destructor were 13% smaller in size and were 59.1 times more likely to die than colonies infested with low levels of V. destructor. Infestation with high levels of Nosema sp. led to 2% decrease in size and 1.4 times higher likelihood to die compared to colonies with low levels of Nosema sp. No effects of chronic sublethal exposure to imidacloprid on colony size or survival were found in this study. Exposure to V. destructor and imidacloprid led to a slightly higher fraction of bees infested with Nosema sp., but in contrast to the expectations, no resulting interactions were found for colony size or survival. Colonies as a superorganism may well be able to compensate at the colony level for sublethal negative effects of stressors on their individuals. In our experimental study under field-realistic exposure to stressors, V. destructor was by far the most lethal one for honey bee colonies. © 2018 The Authors.",2018,10.1002/ecs2.2378,9,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Social Buffering of Pesticides in Bumblebees: Agent-Based Modeling of the Effects of Colony Size and Neonicotinoid Exposure on Behavior Within Nests,201,JOUR,"['Crall, JD', 'de Bivort, BL', 'Dey, B', 'Versypt, ANF']",FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Neonicotinoids are a globally prevalent class of pesticides that can negatively affect bees and the pollination services they provide. While there is evidence suggesting that colony size may play an important role inmitigating neonicotinoid exposure in bees, mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests. Our results suggest that changes in both number of workers and nest architecture may contribute to making larger colonies less sensitive to pesticide exposure.",2019,10.3389/fevo.2019.00051,7,,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Solitary bee behaviour and pollination service delivery is differentially impacted by neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides,451,JOUR,"[""O'Reilly, A.D."", 'Stanley, D.A.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Solitary bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and their decline poses a risk to the sustained provision of the services they provide. Although evidence suggests that exposure to insecticides can affect bees, most pesticide research and risk assessment has focussed on social bees and mortality while solitary species are understudied. The ability to forage is critical for solitary bee reproduction, also in how they deliver pollination services, and we know little about how insecticides can impact these behaviours. We exposed solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to field realistic levels of two widely used insecticides with differing modes of action (lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (neonicotinoid)), in a semi-field setting over multiple rounds of exposure. We then tested impacts on bee behaviour and pollination in apples, an important global insect-pollinated crop. Pollination by insecticide-treated bees reduced apple production by up to 86 % depending on the compound and the number of exposures, but the underlying mechanism behind this remains unclear and should be investigated further. Other measurements of pollination services including number of seeds per apple and stigma pollen deposition showed no relationship with pesticide treatment. Bee foraging behaviour was also affected by treatment where both insecticides appear to induce an excitatory effect which was constant for acetamiprid and eventually ceased for lambda-cyhalothrin after multiple exposures. This suggests that both neonicotinoid and non‑neonicotinoid insecticides can potentially affect behaviour and pollination services of solitary bees depending on how often they are exposed, which is particularly important given the changing usage patterns of these compound classes based on regulations around their use. This highlights the importance of moving insecticide risk assessment towards more field realistic scenarios and including sublethal effects on solitary and social bees, in addition to considering repeated exposures of bees to pesticides as is realistic in the field. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164399,894,0.0,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a ""custom"" synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512,64,,0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Sperm viability and gene expression in honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) following exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos,886,JOUR,"['Chaimanee, V.', 'Evans, J.D.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Jackson, C.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid.

Furthermore, unlike honeybees, native pollinator species have received little attention. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the bioinsecticide spinosad were assessed in the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata, an important native pollinator in the Neotropical region. The adult stingless bee workers exhibited high oral insecticide susceptibility, with LD50s of 23.54 and 12.07ng a.i./bee for imidacloprid and spinosad, respectively. Imidacloprid also impaired worker respiration and overall group activity and flight, while spinosad significantly impaired only worker flight despite exhibiting higher oral toxicity to adult workers than imidacloprid. These findings indicate the hazardous nature not only of imidacloprid but also the bioinsecticide spinosad to adult workers of the native pollinator M. quadrifasciata.

In the current study, we evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53, 13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) of spinosad (formulation), and the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied. The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) reduced the survival of workers during development. Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium.

Spinosad, which is synthesized from the fermentation process produced by the soil actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, is one of the most used bioinsecticides today. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of spinosad (formulation) on survival, general group activity and the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in two organs (midgut and brain) of workers of Partamona helleri, after 24 h of oral exposure. Workers were orally exposed to different concentrations of spinosad. The concentration (8.16 x 10(-3) mg a.i./mL) that led to the mortality of approximately half the number of treated bees was considered LC50 and was used in behavior, histology and immunofluorescence bioassays. The results revealed that bee survival was substantially reduced with increasing spinosad concentrations. The LC50 of the bioinsecticide compromised general group activity, caused morphological alterations in the midgut and intensified the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in this organ. The brain, on the other hand, did not present significant alterations under the tested conditions. The data obtained demonstrate, therefore, that spinosad negatively affects individual survival, general group activity and the midgut epithelium of P. helleri.",2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.03.050,175,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,,,,

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTSThe field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONSThe present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture.

Spray Toxicity and Risk Potential of 42 Commonly Used Formulations of Row Crop Pesticides to Adult Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae),933,JOUR,"['Zhu, Y.C.', 'Adamczyk, J.', 'Rinderer, T.', 'Yao, J.', 'Danka, R.', 'Luttrell, R.', 'Gore, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"To combat an increasing abundance of sucking insect pests, >40 pesticides are currently recommended and frequently used as foliar sprays on row crops, especially cotton. Foraging honey bees may be killed when they are directly exposed to foliar sprays, or they may take contaminated pollen back to hives that maybe toxic to other adult bees and larvae. To assess acute toxicity against the honey bee, we used a modified spray tower to simulate field spray conditions to include direct whole-body exposure, inhalation, and continuing tarsal contact and oral licking after a field spray. A total of 42 formulated pesticides, including one herbicide and one fungicide, were assayed for acute spray toxicity to 4-6-d-old workers. Results showed significantly variable toxicities among pesticides, with LC50s ranging from 25 to thousands of mg/liter. Further risk assessment using the field application concentration to LC1 or LC99 ratios revealed the risk potential of the 42 pesticides. Three pesticides killed less than 1% of the worker bees, including the herbicide, a miticide, and a neonicotinoid. Twenty-six insecticides killed more than 99% of the bees, including commonly used organophosphates and neonicotinoids. The remainder of the 13 chemicals killed from 1-99% of the bees at field application rates. This study reveals a realistic acute toxicity of 42 commonly used foliar pesticides. The information is valuable for guiding insecticide selection to minimize direct killing of foraging honey bees, while maintaining effective control of field crop pests. © 2015 Published by Oxford University Press [on behalf of Entomological Society of America].",2015,10.1093/jee/tov269,108,,0,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field. © 2017 De Smet et al.

Structural and functional impacts of neonicotinoids analogues on Apis mellifera's chemosensory protein: Insights from spectroscopic and molecular modeling investigations,366,JOUR,"['Li, X.', 'Li, S.', 'Qin, Z.', 'Cui, L.', 'Yang, D.', 'Chen, S.', 'Yan, X.', 'Yuan, H.']",International Journal of Biological Macromolecules,"In the intricate web of ecological relationships, pollinators such as the Italian honeybee (Apis mellifera) play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and agricultural productivity. This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UV–visible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's α-helix content, suggesting structural alterations. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further elucidate the binding modes and stability of these interactions, highlighting the role of specific amino acids in CSP3's binding cavity. Findings provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms by which neonicotinoids may impair honeybee chemosensory function, offering implications for designing safer pesticides and understanding the broader ecological impact of these chemicals on pollinator health. © 2024",2024,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.133080,273,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Structure-activity relationships of acyclic nicotinoids and neonicotinoids for insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor/ion channel complex,508,JOUR,"['Matsuo, H', 'Tomizawa, M', 'Yamamoto, I']",ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"The insect nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) is a target site for the neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid and its acyclic derivative acetamiprid. The structure-activity relationships of acetamiprid homologues and 3-pyridylmethylamines (known as the essential structural requirement of nicotinoid) are compared in terms of the affinity to the [H-3]alpha- bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT) site (designated as ACh site) and the [H-3]phencyclidine (PCP) site [designated as noncompetitive blocker (NCB) site] of the insect nAChR from the honeybee heads. Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [H-3]alpha-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [H-3]PCP binding in the insect nAChR. Scatchard analysis reveals that homologues of acetamiprid and 3-pyridylmethylamine having n-butyl substituents interact with the high-affinity binding site for [H-3]PCP, which is considered to be the NCB site located in the ion channel of the insect nAChR. The interaction of acetamiprid homologues with the ACh or NCB site of nAChR is selective for insects, while that of the 3-pyridylmethylamines is effective for both insect and Torpedo [Tomizawa et al., J Pesticide Sci 21:412-418 (1996)], The explorations in further structural modification of neonicotinoid compounds may facilitate development of new insecticides or probes for the ion channel of insect nAChR.

In the honeybee, nAChRs are expressed in diverse structures including the primary olfactory centres of the brain, the antennal lobes (AL) and the mushroom bodies. Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were used to characterize the nAChRs present on cultured AL cells from adult honeybee, Apis mellifera. In 90% of the cells, applications of ACh induced fast inward currents that desensitized slowly. The classical nicotinic agonists nicotine and imidacloprid elicited respectively 45 and 43% of the maximum ACh-induced currents. The ACh-elicited currents were blocked by nicotinic antagonists methyllycaconitine, dihydroxy-β-erythroidine and α-bungarotoxin. The nAChRs on adult AL cells are cation permeable channels. Our data indicate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult AL cells that differ from nAChRs on pupal Kenyon cells from mushroom bodies by their pharmacological profile and ionic permeability, suggesting that these receptors could be implicated in different functions. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",2008,10.1007/s10158-007-0062-2,8,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

Although most neonicotinoids are highly toxic to bees, some of them are relatively safe. To explore the molecular mechanism of these differences in toxicity, homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the interactions between Apis mellifera (α8)2(β1)3 nAChR and high bee-toxic neonicotinoid (imidacloprid, IMI), medium bee-toxic (thiacloprid, THI) and low bee-toxic butenolides (flupyradifurone, FPF). It was observed that three major interactions were similar across all systems, including water-bridge networks, π-π interactions and the polar interactions between the electron-withdrawing pharmacophores and the receptor. The calculated binding free energy was similar between IMI and THI. While FPF was the lowest bee-toxic, it displayed the strongest binding free energy value, the additional C–H⋯O H-bonds with Arg80 and Trp179 were the main reason. The bee toxicities of neonicotinoids and other nAChR modulators are not only determined by receptor affinities, but also by other factors (for example physicochemical properties and metabolic detoxification).

Sub-lethal but potentially devastating - The novel insecticide flupyradifurone impairs collective brood care in bumblebees,397,JOUR,"Fischer, L.R.; Ramesh, D.; Weidenmüller, A.",Science of the Total Environment,"The worldwide decline in pollinating insects is alarming. One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides at the field level affect negatively honey yield: Evidence from a 6-year survey of Greek apiaries,272,JOUR,"['Chambers, RG', 'Chatzimichael, K', 'Tzouvelekas, V']",PLOS ONE,"The threats posed by neonicotinoid insecticides to bee populations have been the focus of considerable research. Previous work has shed new light on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees by uncovering pathways through which neonicotinoids affect bee population dynamics and the potential interactions they have with exogenous stressors. Yet, little is known about whether these effects translate in a field- relevant setting to substantial losses in honey yields for commercial beekeepers. Here, we used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production. Based on production function estimates, we found that sub-lethal concentrations of two widely used neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) detected in the nectar of flowers resulted in substantial losses in honey production for commercial beekeepers in our sample. By simulating a scenario with ideal pathogenic and environmental conditions, we found that the magnitude of the neonicotinoid effects decreases significantly under ideal conditions providing evidence for possible synergies at the field between neonicotinoids and environmental and pathogenic factors. Moreover, in a replicated study with grouped apiaries, we found evidence that the marginal effects of neonicotinoids on honey production vary across apiaries facing different conditions.",2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0215363,14,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,
Sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid and carbamate insecticides reduce the lifespan and alter the expression of immune health and detoxification related genes of honey bees (Apis mellifera),804,JOUR,"['Tarek, H.', 'Hamiduzzaman, M.M.', 'Morfin, N.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",Genetics and Molecular Research,"Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides, but little is known about insecticide effects on their survivorship associated to health-related gene expression. To test the effect of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on the lifespan and health of honey bees, workers were orally and topically exposed to LD5 doses of these insecticides. The survivorship of treated bees was monitored and the expression of three immune-related genes, hymenoptaecin (AmHym), basket (AmBask) and lysozyme (AmLyso2) was analyzed at 24 and 72 hours post treatment (hpt), as well as that of the antioxidant-related gene vitellogenin (AmVit2), the poly-U binding factor (AmPuf68), and the detoxification gene cytochrome P450 (AmCYP9Q3). The three insecticides significantly reduced the length of life of bees but the mode of application did not affect survivorship. AmHym, AmBask and AmVit2 expression was significantly down-regulated at 72 hpt in bees treated with clothianidin and imidacloprid, indicating immunosuppression. However, AmLyso2, AmCYP9Q3 and AmPuf68 were significantly up-regulated. The down-regulation of AmVit2 could have caused decreased resistance to oxidative stress. AmPuf68 expression could be associated with increased protection against xenobionts. AmCYP9Q3 was up-regulated at 24 and 72 hpt in oral exposures, but only until 72 hpt in topical exposures, indicating faster sensitivity towards detoxification mechanisms in oral treatments. This study demonstrated detrimental effects of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on honey bee survivorship, immunity and antioxidant mechanisms, and an induction of defense and detoxification responses that could be physiologically costly to the bees. © 2018 The Authors.",2018,10.4238/gmr16039908,17,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Sub-lethal doses of sulfoxaflor impair honey bee homing ability,573,JOUR,"['Capela, N.', 'Sarmento, A.', 'Simões, S.', 'Azevedo-Pereira, H.M.V.S.', 'Sousa, J.P.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Agricultural intensification has increased the number of stressors that pollinators are exposed to. Besides increasing landscape fragmentation that limit the supply of flower resources, intensive agricultural practices relying on the use of pesticides to control agricultural pests also affect non-target organisms like honey bees. The use of most pesticides containing neonicotinoids has been severely restricted in the European Union, leaving pesticides containing acetamiprid as the only ones that are still authorized. In the meantime, new substances like sulfoxaflor, that have a similar mode of action acting on the insect's nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), have been approved for agricultural use. In Europe and USA, the use of pesticides containing this active ingredient is limited due to toxic effects already reported on bees, but no restrictions regarding this matter were applied in other countries (e.g., Brazil). In this study, homing ability tests with acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor were performed, in which honey bees were fed with three sub-lethal doses from each substance. After exposure, each honey bee was equipped with an RFID chip and released 1 km away from the colony to evaluate their homing ability. No significant effects were detected in honey bees fed with 32, 48 and 61 ng of acetamiprid while a poor performance on their homing ability, with only 28% of them reaching the colony instead of 75%, was detected at a 26 ng/a.s./bee dose of sulfoxaflor. Although, both pesticides act on the nAChR, the higher sulfoxaflor toxicity might be related with the honey bees detoxifying mechanisms, which are more effective on cyano-based neonicotinoids (i.e., acetamiprid) than sulfoximines. With this study we encourage the use of homing ability tests to be a suitable candidate to integrate the future risk assessment scheme, providing valuable data to models predicting effects on colony health that emerge from the individual actions of each bee. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155710,837,0.0,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Sub-lethal effects of dietary neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on honey bee queen fecundity and colony development,893,JOUR,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Scientific Reports,"Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-Term colony functioning.

Subchronic exposure of honeybees to sublethal doses of pesticides: Effects on behavior,997,JOUR,"['Aliouane, Y.', 'El Hassani, A.K.', 'Gary, V.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Lambin, M.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the effects on honeybee behavior of sublethal doses of insecticides chronically administered orally or by contact. Emergent honeybees received a daily dose of insecticide ranging from one-fifth to one-five-hundredth of the median lethal dose (LD50) during 11 d. After exposure to fipronil (0.1 and 0.01 ng/bee), acetamiprid (1 and 0.1 μg/bee), or thiamethoxam (1 and 0.1 ng/bee), behavioral functions of honeybees were tested on day 12. Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open-field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant. Thiamethoxam by contact induced either a significant decrease of olfactory memory 24 h after learning at 0.1 ng/bee or a significant impairment of learning performance with no effect on memory at 1 ng/bee. Responsiveness to antennal sucrose stimulation was significantly decreased for high sucrose concentrations in honeybees treated orally with thiamethoxam (1 ng/bee). The only significant effect of acetamiprid (administered orally, 0.1 μg/bee) was an increase in responsiveness to water. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam tested at the highest dose (one-tenth and one-fifth of their oral LD50, respectively) and fipronil at one-five-hundredth of LD50 have limited effects on the motor, sensory, and cognitive functions of the honeybee.

Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging, and immunocompetence in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Despite these, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation.

Sublethal Imidacloprid Administration to Honey Bee Workers is More Lethal to the Queen Larvae,390,JOUR,"['Chen, Y.-R.', 'Tzeng, D.T.W.', 'Lin, S.-S.', 'Yang, E.-C.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Imidacloprid and other neonicotinoid insecticides severely impact the performance and survival of honey bees and other pollinators. In the present study, we focused on the gene expression profile of newly emerged Apis mellifera queen bees after sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage. Royal jelly containing 1 ppb imidacloprid was provided to larvae for 3 consecutive days (2–4 days postemergence). Queen larvae treated with imidacloprid showed lower capping and emergence rates (35.5% and 24.22%, respectively) than did control larvae (61.68% and 52.95%, respectively), indicating a high failure rate of queen rearing associated with imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage. The molecular response to imidacloprid treatment was examined next. By comparing the gene expression profiles of imidacloprid-treated queen larvae and those of control queen larvae using DESeq2, we identified 215 differentially expressed genes, with 105 and 111 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. Gene Ontology results indicated that chitin binding– and calcium ion binding–related genes were upregulated, while phototransduction- and visual perception–related genes were downregulated. The high mortality rate and altered gene expression profiles suggest that treatment with even 1 ppb imidacloprid can severely impact queen bee survival.

Sublethal acetamiprid doses negatively affect the lifespans and foraging behaviors of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) workers,681,JOUR,"['Shi, J.', 'Yang, H.', 'Yu, L.', 'Liao, C.', 'Liu, Y.', 'Jin, M.', 'Yan, W.', 'Wu, X.B.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid is applied widely for pest control in agriculture production. However, little is known about the effects of acetamiprid on the foraging behavior of nontarget pollinators. This study aims to investigate effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on lifespans and foraging behaviors of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) under natural swarm conditions. Newly emerged worker bees of each treatment received a drop of 1.5 μL acetamiprid solution (containing 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg/bee acetamiprid, diluted by water) on the thorax respectively. Bees from 2-day-old to deadline were monitored on foraging behaviors involving the age of bee for first foraging flights, rotating day-off status and the number of foraging flights using the radio frequency identification (RFID) system. We found that acetamiprid at 2 μg/bee significantly reduced the lifespan, induced precocious foraging activity, influenced the rotating day-off status and decreased foraging flights of worker bees. The abnormal behaviors of worker bees may be associated with a decline in lifespan.

Global concerns about declining bee populations due to agrochemical pollutants have, however, been biased towards the honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. Here, we analysed the unintended effects of commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, and a fungicide mixture of thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil on color preference, respiration rates and group locomotory activities of both P. helleri and A. mellifera. Our results revealed that P. helleri foragers that were not exposed to pesticides changed their color preference during the course of a year. By contrast, we found that pesticide exposure altered the color preference of stingless bees in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, imidacloprid decreased the overall locomotion of both bee species, whereas the fungicide mixture increased locomotion of only stingless bees. The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl). Our findings emphasize the importance of P. helleri as a model for Neotropical wild pollinator species in pesticide risk assessments, and also the critical importance of including groups of agrochemicals that are often considered to have minimal impact on pollinators, such as fungicides. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146432,779,,0,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Sublethal behavioral impacts of resource limitation and insecticide exposure reinforce negative fitness outcomes for a solitary bee,494,JOUR,"['Stuligross, C.', 'Melone, G.G.', 'Wang, L.', 'Williams, N.M.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Contemporary landscapes present numerous challenges for bees and other beneficial insects that play critical functional roles in natural ecosystems and agriculture. Pesticides and the loss of food resources from flowering plants are two stressors known to act together to impair bee fitness. The impact of these stressors on key behaviors like foraging and nesting can limit pollination services and population persistence, making it critical to understand these sublethal effects. We investigated the effects of insecticide exposure and floral resource limitation on the foraging and nesting behavior of the solitary blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in field cages foraged on wildflowers at high or low densities, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design. Both stressors influenced behavior, but they had differential impacts. Bees with limited food resources made fewer, but longer foraging trips and misidentified their nests more often. Insecticide exposure reduced bee foraging activity. Additionally, insecticides interacted with bee age to influence antagonistic behavior among neighboring females, such that insecticide-exposed bees were less antagonistic with age. Our findings point towards mechanisms underlying effects on populations and ecosystem function and reinforce the importance of studying multiple drivers to understand the consequences of anthropogenic change. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161392,867,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

To explore potential colony-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide at field-relevant concentrations, honey bee colonies were fed 5- and 20-ppb concentrations of clothianidin in sugar syrup while control colonies were fed unadulterated syrup. Two experiments were conducted in successive years at the same site in southern Arizona, and one in the high rainfall environment of Mississippi. Across all three experiments, adult bee masses were about 21% lower among colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin than the untreated control group, but no effects of treatment on brood production were observed. Average daily hive weight losses per day in the 5-ppb clothianidin colonies were about 39% lower post-treatment than in the 20-ppb clothianidin colonies, indicating lower consumption and/or better foraging, but the dry weights of newly-emerged adult bees were on average 6–7% lower in the 5-ppb group compared to the other groups, suggesting a nutritional problem in the 5-ppb group. Internal hive CO2 concentration was higher on average in colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin, which could have resulted from greater CO2 production and/or reduced ventilating activity. Hive temperature average and daily variability were not affected by clothianidin exposure but did differ significantly among trials. Clothianidin was found to be, like imidacloprid, highly stable in honey in the hive environment over several months. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,10.1038/s41598-021-83958-8,11,,0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Sublethal dosage of imidacloprid reduces the microglomerular density of honey bee mushroom bodies,887,JOUR,"['Peng, Y.-C.', 'Yang, E.-C.']",Scientific Reports,"The dramatic loss of honey bees is a major concern worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides cause behavioural abnormalities and have proven that exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage decreases the olfactory learning ability of adults. The present study shows the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the neural development of the honey bee brain by immunolabelling synaptic units in the calyces of mushroom bodies. We found that the density of the synaptic units in the region of the calyces, which are responsible for olfactory and visual functions, decreased after being exposed to a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. This not only links a decrease in olfactory learning ability to abnormal neural connectivity but also provides evidence that imidacloprid damages the development of the nervous system in regions responsible for both olfaction and vision during the larval stage of the honey bee.",2016,10.1038/srep19298,6,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

However, they are less studied than managed bees, mainly regarding the harmful effects of pesticides present in agroecosystems commonly visited by them. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of residual doses of imidacloprid and pyraclostrobin, alone and in combination, on the fat body (a multifunctional organ) of the neotropical solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes by means of morphological and histochemical evaluation of oenocytes and trophocytes. Males and females of newly-emerged adults were submitted to bioassays of acute topical exposure. Experimental groups were essayed: control (CTR), solvent control (ACT), imidacloprid (IMI, 0.0028 ng/μL), pyraclostrobin (PYR, 2.7 ng/μL) and imidacloprid + pyraclostrobin (I + P). The data demonstrated that the residual doses applied in T. diversipes adults are sublethal at 96 h. Both oenocytes and trophocytes cells responded to topical exposure to the pesticides, showing morphological changes. In the IMI group, the bee oenocytes showed the greatest proportion of vacuolization and altered nuclei. The pyraclostrobin exposure increased the intensity of PAS-positive labeling (glycogen) in trophocytes. This increase was also observed in the I + P group. Changes in energy reserve (glycogen) of trophocytes indicate a possible mobilization impairment of this neutral polysaccharide to the hemolymph, which can compromise the fitness of exposed individuals. Also, changes in oenocytes can compromise the detoxification function performed by the fat body.

Sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid can interact with honey bee chemosensory protein 1 (CSP1) and inhibit its function,256,JOUR,"['Li, H.', 'Tan, J.', 'Song, X.', 'Wu, F.', 'Tang, M.', 'Hua, Q.', 'Zheng, H.', 'Hu, F.']",Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,"As a frequently used neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid can impair the chemoreceptive behavior of honey bees even at sublethal doses, while the physiochemical mechanism has not been further revealed. Here, multiple fluorescence spectra, thermodynamic method, and molecular docking were used to study the interaction and the functional inhibition of imidacloprid to the recombinant CSP1 protein in Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity (λem = 332 nm) of CSP1 could be significantly quenched by imidacloprid in a dynamic mode. During the quenching process, ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, indicating that the acting forces of imidacloprid with CSP1 are mainly hydrophobic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the binding process. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the α-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain. In addition, the binding of CSP1 to floral scent β-ionone was inhibited by nearly 50% of the apparent association constant (KA) in the presence of 0.28–2.53 ng/bee of imidacloprid, and the inhibition rate of nearly 95% at 3.75 ng/bee of imidacloprid at sublethal dose level.

Risk assessments have reported its high toxicity to pollinators. However, sulfoxaflor is not persistent in the environment and few studies have addressed its negative effects on larval and newly emerged honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, the sublethal effects of a sulfoxaflor commercial product, Isoclast™ Active, were evaluated in the laboratory using larvae and newly emerged worker honeybees. The results of 96-h acute toxicity showed that Isoclast is moderately toxic to adult bees, and it could induce significant death and growth failure of larvae after continuous dietary intake. In addition, Isoclast induced significant changes in antioxidative (SOD, CAT), lipid peroxidation (POD, LPO, MDA), detoxification (GST, GR, GSH) and signal transduction-related (AChE, ACh) enzymes or products both in larvae and adult honey bees under residue levels. Here we firstly reported the lethal and sublethal effects of commercial sulfoxaflor to honeybees’ larvae and young workers.

Additional groups of bees were challenged with Nosema infections or with combinations of the pesticide and pathogens. Longevity and flight activity of the differentially treated bees were monitored for a period of 18 days. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, no effect of the neonicotinoid treatment on mortality or flight activity could be observed. Although the lifespan of Nosema infected bees were significantly reduced compared to non-infected bees a combination of pesticide and pathogen did not reveal any synergistic effect. Our results indicate that individual bees are less impaired by neonicotinoids if kept within the social environment of the colony.

Honey bee colonies fed sublethal concentrations of imidicloprid (0, 5, 20 and 100 ppb) over 6 weeks in field trials at a desert site (Arizona), a site near intensive agriculture (Arkansas) and a site with little nearby agriculture but abundant natural forage (Mississippi) were monitored with respect to colony metrics, such as adult bee and brood population sizes, as well as pesticide residues. Hive weight and internal hive temperature were monitored continuously over two trials in Arizona. Colonies fed 100 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona had significantly lower adult bee populations, brood surface areas and average frame weights, and reduced temperature control, compared to colonies in one or more of the other treatment groups, and consumption rates of those colonies were lower compared to other colonies in Arizona and Arkansas, although no differences in capped brood or average frame weight were observed among treatments in Arkansas. At the Mississippi site, also rich in alternative forage, colonies fed 5 ppb imidacloprid had less capped brood than control colonies, but contamination of control colonies was detected. In contrast, significantly higher daily hive weight variability among colonies fed 5 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona suggested greater foraging activity during a nectar flow post treatment, than any other treatment group. Imidacloprid concentrations in stored honey corresponded well with the respective syrup concentrations fed to the colonies and remained stable within the hive for at least 7 months after the end of treatment. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The nectar- and water-collecting, and climbing abilities of bees are crucial to the survival of the bees and the execution of responsibilities in bee colonies. Besides behavioral impact, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid, especially by the way of RNA-seq at the transcriptomic level, are limited. We treated Apis mellifera L. with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) and determined the effect on behaviors and the transcriptomic changes. The sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid had a limited impact on the survival and syrup consumption of bees, but caused a significant increase in water consumption. Moreover, the climbing ability was significantly impaired by 10 ppb imidacloprid at 8 d. In the RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment indicated a significant down-regulation of muscle-related genes, which might contribute to the impairment in climbing ability of bees. The enriched GO terms were attributed to the up-regulated ribosomal protein genes.

Effects of imidacloprid food stores contaminants were examined in subtropical colonies that experience reduced brood rearing and foraging during overwintering. Colonies were given treatment sugar syrup containing 0 ppb (control), 20 ppb (field relevant), or 100 ppb (above field relevant) imidacloprid over six weeks to simulate contaminated fall nectar. Colonies were evaluated immediately (post-treatment) and 10 weeks (mid-winter) after treatment to compare proximal and latent effects.

Mid-winter 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies and 0 ppb colonies more brood than 100 ppb colonies. Colonies experienced seasonal declines in stored pollen but no treatment effects. Lower 100 ppb colony performance was associated with reduced effort rather than lifespan. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking revealed that workers had similar adult lifespans across treatments; however, 100 ppb workers engaged in activities outside the colony for less time than 0 ppb workers. Imidacloprid exposure affected queen but not worker nutritional physiology. Nurses retained well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (as indicated by head protein) across treatments.

In this study, larvae were exposed to three sublethal doses of clothianidin and evaluated 25–36 days later for hygienic and foraging behaviours as adult bees. The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen.

Sublethal exposure to imidacloprid in commercial Apis mellifera colonies in early spring: performance of honey bees and insecticide transference between in-hive products,497,JOUR,"['Michlig, M.P.', 'Pacini, A.C.', 'Merke, J.', 'Orellano, E.M.', 'Brasca, R.', 'Repetti, M.R.']",Apidologie,"Honey bees have an important role in ecosystems as pollinators. However, in recent years, bee populations have declined, with habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change contributing to the decline.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of imidacloprid in commercial Apis mellifera L. colonies artificially fed with syrups spiked with this insecticide and its possible transfer among in-hive products such as honey and larvae. For this purpose, 30 colonies were placed in the same apiary; once a week for 7 weeks in early spring, each colony was fed with 0.5 L of syrup with the following doses of imidacloprid: 0, 15, 30, 120, and 240 µg kg−1. The colony strength was evaluated by monitoring: the number of adult bees and brood combs, queenlessness, unhealthy colonies (by detection of Nosema spp. spores and European foulbrood), as well as pollen and honey storage. Worker bees, larvae, honey, and beeswax were sampled to evaluate imidacloprid transfer within the hive.

Sublethal exposure to thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin affects the midgut and Malpighian tubules of the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini),375,JOUR,"['da Silva, J.A.', 'Farder-Gomes, C.F.', 'Barchuk, A.R.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Ecotoxicology,"The stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia Lepeletier 1836 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an essential pollinator in natural and agricultural ecosystems in the Neotropical region. However, these bees may be exposed to pesticides during foraging, which can affect both individuals and their colonies. One example comes from the use of pyraclostrobin (a fungicide) and thiamethoxam (an insecticide) for pest control in pepper crops, which F. varia visits. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined sublethal effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) (0.000543 ng a.i./µL) and pyraclostrobin (PYR) (1.5 ng i.a./µL) on the morphology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of F. varia workers. Results showed that both pesticides, regardless of the exposure time (through feeding during 48 h or 96 h), disturbed the morphology of the analyzed organs. Specifically, F. varia exposed orally to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin, either alone or in combination, exhibited a higher rate of damage to the midgut (e.g., vacuolization, apocrine secretion, and cellular elimination) compared to the bees in the control groups, both after 48 h and 96 h of exposure. In Malpighian tubules, vacuolation is the only damage present. As the observed morphological alterations likely compromise the excretion and absorption functions, exposure to pyraclostrobin and thiamethoxam may lead to disturbances at both the individual and colony levels. These results highlight the urgent need for a future reassessment of the safety of fungicides and insecticides regarding their potential effects on bee populations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02786-4,33,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,
Sublethal imidacloprid effects on honey bee flower choices when foraging,918,JOUR,"['Karahan, A.', 'Çakmak, I.', 'Hranitz, J.M.', 'Karaca, I.', 'Wells, H.']",Ecotoxicology,"Neonicotinoids, systemic neuro-active pesticides similar to nicotine, are widely used in agriculture and are being investigated for a role in honey bee colony losses. We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 μL 1 M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 μL of 1.5 M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 μL 0.5 M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30 min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed. We observed acute, mild effects on foraging by honey bees, so mild that storage of imidacloprid tainted-honey is very plausible and likely to be found in honey bee colonies. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2015,10.1007/s10646-015-1537-2,24,,0,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long-term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life-cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.",2014,10.1111/afe.12041,16,0.0,0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,

We demonstrate for the first time a synergistic interaction when larvae are exposed to sublethal doses of dimethoate or clothianidin in combination with Paenibacillus larvae, the causative agent of AFB.

Sucrose sensitivity of honey bees is differently affected by dietary protein and a neonicotinoid pesticide,898,JOUR,"['Démares, F.J.', 'Crous, K.L.', 'Pirk, C.W.W.', 'Nicolson, S.W.', 'Human, H.']",PLoS ONE,"Over a decade, declines in honey bee colonies have raised worldwide concerns. Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. © 2016 Démares et al.

Sulfoxaflor and nutritional deficiency synergistically reduce survival and fecundity in bumblebees,623,JOUR,"['Linguadoca, A.', 'Rizzi, C.', 'Villa, S.', 'Brown, M.J.F.']",Science of the Total Environment,"A range of anthropogenic factors are causing unprecedented bee declines. Among these drivers the usage of pesticides is believed to be crucial. While the use of key bee-harming insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, has been reduced by regulatory authorities, novel, less studied substances have occupied their market niche. Understanding the threat of these chemicals to bees is, therefore, crucial to their conservation. Here we focus on sulfoxaflor, a novel insecticide, targeting the same neural receptor as the neonicotinoids. In stark contrast to the growing concerns around its negative impacts on bee health, a recent assessment has resulted in the extension of its authorisations across the USA. However, such assessments may underestimate risks by overlooking interactive impacts of multiple stressors. Here we investigated co-occurring, lethal and sublethal risks of sulfoxaflor and a dietary stress for bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), a key pollinator. Specifically, we employed a novel microcolony design, where, for the first time in bees, pesticide exposure mimicked natural degradation. We orally exposed workers to sulfoxaflor and a sugar-deficient diet in a fully factorial design. Field realistic, worst-case sulfoxaflor exposure caused a sharp increase in bee mortality. At sublethal concentrations, sulfoxaflor negatively affected bee fecundity, but not survival. Nutritional stress reduced bee fecundity and synergistically or additively aggravated impacts of sulfoxaflor on bee survival, egg laying and larval production. Our data show that non-mitigated label uses of sulfoxaflor may have major, yet severely neglected effects on bumblebee health, which may be exacerbated by nutritional stress. By unravelling mechanistic interactions of synergistic risks, our study highlights the need to overcome inherent limitations of Environmental Risk Assessment schemes, which, being based on a “single stressor paradigm”, may fail to inform policymakers of the real risks of pesticide use. © 2021",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148680,795,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,,,
Sulfoxaflor effects depend on the interaction with other pesticides and Nosema ceranae infection in the honey bee (Apis mellifera),460,JOUR,"['Urueña, Á.', 'Blasco-Lavilla, N.', 'De la Rúa, P.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Honey bees health is compromised by many factors such as the use of agrochemicals in agriculture and the various diseases that can affect them. Multiple studies have shown that these factors can interact, producing a synergistic effect that can compromise the viability of honey bees. This study analyses the interactions between different pesticides and the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and their effect on immune and detoxification gene expression, sugar consumption and mortality in the Iberian western honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). For this purpose, workers were infected with N. ceranae and subjected to a sugar-water diet with field concentrations of the pesticides sulfoxaflor, azoxystrobin and glyphosate. Increased sugar intake and altered immune and cytochrome P450 gene expression were observed in workers exposed to sulfoxaflor and infected with N. ceranae. None of the pesticides affected Nosema spore production in honey bee gut. Of the three pesticides tested (alone or in combination) only sulfoxaflor increased mortality in honey bees. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of sulfoxaflor were attenuated in contact with other pesticides, and that Nosema infection leads to increase sugar intake in sulfoxaflor-exposed bees. Overall, this underlines the importance of studying the interaction between different stressors to understand their overall impact not only on honey bee but also on wild bees health. © 2023 The Authors",2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115427,264,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Sulfoxaflor exposure reduces bumblebee reproductive success,15,JOUR,"['Siviter, H', 'Brown, MJF', 'Leadbeater, E']",NATURE,"Intensive agriculture currently relies on pesticides to maximize crop yield(1,2). Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides globally(3), but increasing evidence of negative impacts on important pollinators(4-9) and other non-target organisms(10) has led to legislative reassessment and created demand for the development of alternative products. Sulfoximine-based insecticides are the most likely successor(11), and are either licensed for use or under consideration for licensing in several worldwide markets(3), including within the European Union(12), where certain neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam) are now banned from agricultural use outside of permanent greenhouse structures. There is an urgent need to pre-emptively evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of sulfoximine-based pesticides on pollinators(11), because such effects are rarely detected by standard ecotoxicological assessments, but can have major impacts at larger ecological scales(13-15). Here we show that chronic exposure to the sulfoximine-based insecticide sulfoxaflor, at dosages consistent with potential post-spray field exposure, has severe sub-lethal effects on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. Field-based colonies that were exposed to sulfoxaflor during the early growth phase produced significantly fewer workers than unexposed controls, and ultimately produced fewer reproductive offspring. Differences between the life-history trajectories of treated and control colonies first became apparent when individuals exposed as larvae began to emerge, suggesting that direct or indirect effects on a small cohort may have cumulative long-term consequences for colony fitness. Our results caution against the use of sulfoximines as a direct replacement for neonicotinoids. To avoid continuing cycles of novel pesticide release and removal, with concomitant impacts on the environment, a broad evidence base needs to be assessed prior to the development of policy and regulation.",2018,10.1038/s41586-018-0430-6,561,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Sulfoxaflor exposure reduces egg laying in bumblebees Bombus terrestris,716,JOUR,"['Siviter, H.', 'Horner, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Sulfoximine-based insecticides, such as sulfoxaflor, are of increasing global importance and have been registered for use in 81 countries, offering a potential alternative to neonicotinoid insecticides. Previous studies have demonstrated that sulfoxaflor exposure can have a negative impact on the reproductive output of bumblebee colonies, but the specific life-history variables that underlie these effects remain unknown. Here, we used a microcolony-based protocol to assess the sub-lethal effects of chronic sulfoxaflor exposure on egg laying, larval production, ovary development, sucrose consumption, and mortality in bumblebees. Following a pre-registered design, we exposed colonies to sucrose solutions containing 0, 5, 10 and 250ppb of sulfoxaflor. Exposure at 5 ppb has been previously shown to negatively impact colony reproductive success. Our results showed that sulfoxaflor exposure at 5 ppb (lowest exposure tested) reduced the number of eggs found within the microcolonies (Hedge's d = −0.37), with exposed microcolonies also less likely to produce larvae (Hedge's d = −0.36). Despite this, we found no effect of sulfoxaflor exposure on ovarian development. Sulfoxaflor-exposed bumblebees consumed less sucrose solution, potentially driving the observed reduction in egg laying. Policy implications. Regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are under increasing pressure to consider the potential impact of insecticides on wild bees, such as bumblebees, but sublethal effects can go undetected at lower-tier testing. In identifying just such an effect for bumblebees exposed to sulfoxaflor, this study highlights that microcolony-based protocols are a useful tool that could be implemented within an ecotoxicology framework. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for potentially negative consequences of pollinator exposure to an insecticide that is currently undergoing the licensing process in several EU member states. © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells.

Sulfoxaflor insecticide and azoxystrobin fungicide have no major impact on honeybees in a realistic-exposure semi-field experiment,614,JOUR,"['Tamburini, G.', 'Wintermantel, D.', 'Allan, M.J.', 'Dean, R.R.', 'Knauer, A.', 'Albrecht, M.', 'Klein, A.-M.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Exposure to pesticides is considered a major threat to bees and several neonicotinoid insecticides were recently banned in cropland within the European Union in light of evidence of their potential detrimental effects. Nonetheless, bees remain exposed to many pesticides whose effects are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that one of the most prominent replacements of the banned neonicotinoids – the insecticide sulfoxaflor - harms bees and that fungicides may have been overlooked as a driver of bee declines. Realistic-exposure studies are, however, lacking. Here, we assess the impact of the insecticide Closer (active ingredient: sulfoxaflor) and the widely used fungicide Amistar (a.i.: azoxystrobin) on honeybees in a semi-field study (10 flight cages containing a honeybee colony, for each of three treatments: Closer, Amistar, control). The products were applied according to label instructions either before (Closer) or during (Amistar) the bloom of purple tansy. We found no significant effects of Closer or Amistar on honeybee colony development or foraging activity. Our study suggests that these pesticides pose no notable risk to honeybees when applied in isolation, following stringent label instructions. The findings on Closer indicate that a safety-period of 5–6 days between application and bloom, which is only prescribed in a few EU member states, may prevent its impacts on honeybees. However, to conclude whether Closer and Amistar can safely be applied, further realistic-exposure studies should examine their effects in combination with other chemical or biological stressors on various pollinator species. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146084,778,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,

While these factors have been well studied individually, the experimental designs do not reflect real-world conditions where insecticide exposure and lack of forage occur simultaneously and could interactively suppress pollinator health. Using outdoor enclosures, we tested the effects of insecticides (imidacloprid + lambda-cyhalothrin) and non-crop forage (clover) in a factorial design, measuring the survival, behaviour and performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), as well as pollination of the focal crop, watermelon. Colony survival was synergistically reduced to 17% in watermelon alone + insecticides (survival was 100% in all other treatments). However, behavioural shifts in foraging were mainly owing to insecticides (e.g. 95% reduced visitation rate to watermelon flowers), while impacts on hive performance were primarily driven by clover presence (e.g. 374% increase in the number of live eggs). Insecticide-mediated reductions in foraging decreased crop pollination (fruit set) by 32%. Altogether, these data indicate that both insecticides and non-crop forage play integral roles in shaping pollinator health in agricultural landscapes, but the relative importance and interaction of these two factors depend on which aspect of 'health' is being considered.  © 2021 The Authors.",2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.0785,288,0.0,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,
Surrogate species in pesticide risk assessments: Toxicological data of three stingless bees species,502,JOUR,"['Lourencetti, A.P.S.', 'Azevedo, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Environmental Pollution,"Discussions about environmental risk reassessment of pesticides have grown in the last decades, especially in tropical and subtropical regions since the diversity of bee species in these places is quite different. Stingless bees are highly affected by pesticides, and toxicity information is necessary to include them in the regulatory process of countries that hosts a diversity of these species. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50), estimate the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) and compared the sensitivity of three species of stingless bees exposed to the commercial formulation of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TMX). The LD50 was estimated based on the LC50 determined in the present study (LC50 = 0.329 ng a.i./μL for Tetragonisca angustula; 0.624 ng a.i./μL for Scaptotrigona postica, and 0.215 ng a.i./μL for Melipona scutellaris). Considering these data, toxicity endpoints were used to fit species sensitive distribution curves (SSD) and determine the sensitivity ratio. The results showed that all the stingless bees tested are more sensitive to TMX than the Apis mellifera, the model organism used in ecotoxicological tests. Regarding the oral LC50, the most susceptible and most tolerant species were M. scutellaris > T. angustula > S. postica > A. mellifera. Following the same evaluated pattern, for the LD50 (considering the weight of the bees - ng a.i./g bee), we have: M. scutellaris > S. postica > T. angustula > A. mellifera, and without the weight considered (ng a.i./bee): T. angustula > M. scutellaris > S. postica > A. mellifera. The different sensitivities among stingless bee species highlight the importance of inserting more than one surrogate species with a variety of sizes in research and protocol development. Additionally, the research suggests the need to investigate patterns regarding the influence of body mass on pesticide sensitivity among stingless bee species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120842,318,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,

The novel pesticide sulfoxaflor is a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. While there is evidence of a negative impact of neonicotinoids on bees of several social organization levels, our overall knowledge on the impact of sulfoxaflor on bees is poor. Here we present for the first time a study showing effects of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor on solitary bees. Bees submitted to long term exposure of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor (5 µg dm-3, 10 µg dm-3, 50 µg dm-3) and control were observed regarding their survival rate. Moreover, we recorded metrics related to flower visitation and flight performance. We discover that the highest field realistic dose is lethal to Osmia bicornis along five days of exposure. The effect of sulfoxaflor reduces the outcome of foraging, important features for fruit and seed production of cross-pollinated plant species. Bees exposed to pesticide visited flowers mostly walking rather than flying.

Susceptibility of Megachile rotundata to insecticides used in wild blueberry production in Atlantic Canada,137,JOUR,"['Gradish, A.E.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.', 'Cutler, G.C.']",Journal of Pest Science,"The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), is a valuable wild and managed pollinator of lowbush blueberry (syn.

As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,0.0,0,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,0.0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,,
Synergistic and Antagonistic Interactions Between Varroa destructor Mites and Neonicotinoid Insecticides in Male Apis mellifera Honey Bees,615,JOUR,"['Bruckner, S.', 'Straub, L.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Williams, G.R.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"Pressures from multiple, sometimes interacting, stressors can have negative consequences to important ecosystem-service providing species like the western honey bee (Apis mellifera). The introduced parasite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid class of insecticides each represent important, nearly ubiquitous biotic and abiotic stressors to honey bees, respectively. Previous research demonstrated that they can synergistically interact to negatively affect non-reproductive honey bee female workers, but no data exist on how concurrent exposure may affect reproductive honey bee males (drones). This is important, given that the health of reproductive females (queens), possibly because of poor mating, is frequently cited as a major driver of honey bee colony loss. To address this, known age cohorts of drones were obtained from 12 honey bee colonies—seven were exposed to field-relevant concentrations of two neonicotinoids (4.5 ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5 ppb clothianidin) during development via supplementary pollen patties; five colonies received patties not spiked with neonicotinoids. Artificially emerged drones were assessed for natural V. destructor infestation, weighed, and then allocated to the following treatment groups: 1. Control, 2. V. destructor only, 3. Neonicotinoid only, and 4. Combined (both mites and neonicotinoid). Adult drones were maintained in laboratory cages alongside attendant workers (1 drone: 2 worker ratio) until they have reached sexual maturity after 14 days so sperm concentration and viability could be assessed. The data suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids interacted synergistically to negatively affect adult drone survival, but that they interacted antagonistically on emergence mass. Although sample sizes were too low to assess the effects of V. destructor and combined exposure on sperm quality, we observed no influence of neonicotinoids on sperm concentration or viability. Our findings highlight the diverse effects of concurrent exposure to stressors on honey bees, and suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids can severely affect the number of sexually mature adult drones available for mating.

Synergistic effects of imidacloprid and high temperature on honey bee colonies,520,JOUR,"['Kim, S.', 'Cho, S.', 'Lee, S.H.']",Apidologie,"With the rising occurrence of sudden heat waves, honey bees are at risk of exposure to unprecedented heat stress. We investigated the synergistic effects of imidacloprid (IMD) and high temperature on honey bees. Mini hives were treated with IMD (20 ppb for 14 days) and high temperature (41 °C for 6 h) either singly or in combination. Heat shock protein 70 and 90 genes were upregulated in bees exposed to the combined treatment compared to those exposed to each single treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that metabolic pathways remained intact in the high temperature treatment, whereas several metabolic pathways were altered by either the IMD treatment (downregulation of cellular respiration pathways) or the combined treatment (upregulation of protein synthesis and signaling pathways).

Synergistic effects of pathogen and pesticide exposure on honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival and immunity,806,JOUR,"['Grassl, J.', 'Holt, S.', 'Cremen, N.', 'Peso, M.', 'Hahne, D.', 'Baer, B.']",Journal of Invertebrate Pathology,"Declines in native insect pollinator populations and substantial losses in managed honey bees have been reported on a global scale and become a widespread concern because of the importance of these insects for human food production and ecosystem stability. Several potential factors have been studied as possible causes of declining pollinator health, such as parasites and pathogens, exposure to agricultural pesticides, habitat loss and/or climate change. More recently, a combination of these factors rather than a single cause have been blamed for observed pollinator losses, but field studies of such interactions are challenging, especially in the presence of confounding environmental stressors. We therefore examined the impact of single and combined stressors on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a generally healthy Australian population. We exposed workers during their larval development and drones until they reached sexual maturity to the neonicotinoid pesticide Thiamethoxam, at concentrations more than 20 times lower than we initially measured in the field, the microsporidian gut pathogen Nosema apis or both stressors at the same time. We found that simultaneous exposure significantly reduced bee health. We observed a substantial increase in mortality and a reduction of immunocompetence in workers exposed to both the pathogen and the pesticide. We conclude that the exposure of generally healthy bees to multiple environmental stressors results in synergistic effects where the effects are expected to negatively impact performance and could be sufficient to trigger colony collapse. We found that the vast majority of males did not survive to sexual maturity after exposure to very low levels of Thiamethoxam. This would not only reduce the reproductive success of individual colonies, but can also impact gene flow and genetic diversity at the population level, which are both known as key components of honey bee health. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018,10.1016/j.jip.2018.10.005,159,0.0,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
Synergistic effects of three sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicides on the toxicity of a pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticide to bumble bees,751,JOUR,"['Iverson, A.', 'Hale, C.', 'Richardson, L.', 'Miller, O.', 'McArt, S.']",Apidologie,"Understanding how different pesticides influence bee health is inhibited by a limited knowledge about the interactions between different compounds to which bees are simultaneously exposed. Although research has demonstrated synergistic effects of some sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicides on the toxicity of certain insecticides to bees, a high degree of variability exists in the relatively few SBI fungicide-insecticide interactions tested. Furthermore, most research has been conducted on honey bees, Apis mellifera, limiting our understanding of pesticide synergisms in native wild bees. We tested the effects of the SBI fungicides difenoconazole, myclobutanil, and fenhexamid on acute contact toxicity of the insecticides thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid) and bifenthrin (pyrethroid) to the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Based on range-finding trials, we selected a single dosage of each pesticide, with insecticides approximating LD20 values and fungicides approximating their maximum sublethal levels. We found that the triazole SBI fungicide difenoconazole interacted synergistically with bifenthrin, with a maximum synergy ratio of 1.48, while the triazole myclobutanil interacted synergistically with both bifenthrin and thiamethoxam, with maximum synergy ratios of 11.0 and 2.38, respectively. However, the hydroxyanilide SBI fungicide fenhexamid did not exhibit a synergistic effect on either insecticide. Our results suggest that certain SBI fungicides, and potentially those from particular SBI classes, may be particularly harmful to bumble bee health when co-exposure to insecticides occurs, despite their low toxicity when experienced in isolation. © 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2019,10.1007/s13592-019-00681-0,50,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Synergistic interactions between a variety of insecticides and an ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor fungicide in dietary exposures of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.),831,JOUR,"['Raimets, R.', 'Karise, R.', 'Mänd, M.', 'Kaart, T.', 'Ponting, S.', 'Song, J.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, concern has been raised over honey bee colony losses, and also among wild bees there is evidence for extinctions and range contractions in Europe and North America. Pesticides have been proposed as a potential cause of this decline. Bees are exposed simultaneously to a variety of agrochemicals, which may cause synergistically detrimental impacts, which are incompletely understood. We investigated the toxicity of the fungicide imazalil in mixture with four common insecticides: fipronil (phenylpyrazoid), cypermethrin (pyrethroid), thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides like imazalil can inhibit P450 detoxification systems in insects and therefore fungicide − insecticide co-occurrence might produce synergistic toxicity in bees. We assessed the impact of dietary fungicide − insecticide mixtures on the mortality and feeding rates of laboratory bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.). RESULTS: Regarding mortality, imazalil synergised the toxicity of fipronil, cypermethrin and thiamethoxam, but not imidacloprid. We found no synergistic effects on feeding rates. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that P450-based detoxification processes are differentially important in mitigating the toxicity of certain insecticides, even those of the same chemical class. Our evidence that cocktail effects can arise in bumble bees should extend concern about the potential impacts of agrochemical mixtures to include wild bee species in farmland. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2018,10.1002/ps.4756,74,,0,0.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,
Synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid insecticide and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide in three bee species,876,JOUR,"['Sgolastra, F.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Bortolotti, L.', 'Renzi, M.T.', 'Tosi, S.', 'Bogo, G.', 'Teper, D.', 'Porrini, C.', 'Molowny-Horas, R.', 'Bosch, J.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Neonicotinoid insecticides have been identified as an important factor contributing to bee diversity declines. Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory. RESULTS: We developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24 h) and B. terrestris (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry",2017,10.1002/ps.4449,73,0.0,0,0.0,,,1.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,

In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58.6 mg a.i./L imidacloprid)+Domark (512.5 mg a.i. /L tetraconazole), Advise+Transform (58.5 mg a.i./L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a. i./L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20%, 15%, and 26% respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mga.i./L L- cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees. Our findings indicated mixtures of Advise with detoxification-enzyme-inducing pesticides may help bees to detoxify Advise, while toxicity synergists may pose further risk to bees, such as the Bracket which not only suppressed esterase and AChE activities, but also increased toxicity to bees.",2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0176837,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,

In agricultural practice, several types of insecticides are often applied simultaneously, but their synergistic effects on honeybees remain elusive. Here, we treated honeybees with various binary mixtures of insecticides in which a sublethal dose of Th was mixed with three other common insecticides: λ-cyhalothrin (λ-cy), β-cypermethrin (β-cy), and abamectin (Ab). The mortality rates of the groups treated with the insecticide mixtures were higher than that obtained with the pesticides alone. Specifically, the Th + λ-cy and Th + Ab combinations exerted a synergistic effect (P < 0.05) on bees and resulted in significantly higher mortality than that obtained with the single treatments. However, the Th + β-cy mixture had no synergistic effect (P > 0.05) on bees, and the mortality rate of this group was almost identical to those of the groups administered these pesticides alone. Furthermore, the Th + λ-cy and Th + Ab mixtures significantly suppressed the activity and expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are key detoxification enzymes in insects. This result suggests that the Th + λ-cy and Th + Ab combinations at a given concentration adversely affect the survival of honeybees.

Systemic pesticides in a solitary bee pollen food store affect larval development and increase pupal mortality,449,JOUR,"['Phan, N.T.', 'Joshi, N.K.', 'Rajotte, E.G.', 'Zhu, F.', 'Peter, K.A.', 'López-Uribe, M.M.', 'Biddinger, D.J.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Solitary bees are often exposed to various pesticides applied for pest control on farmland while providing pollination services to food crops. Increasing evidence suggests that sublethal toxicity of agricultural pesticides affects solitary bees differently than the social bees used to determine regulatory thresholds, such as honey bees and bumblebees. Studies on solitary bees are challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining large numbers of eggs or young larvae for bioassays. Here we show the toxic and sublethal developmental effects of four widely used plant systemic pesticides on the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons). Pollen food stores of this solitary bee were treated with different concentrations of three insecticides (acetamiprid, flonicamid, and sulfoxaflor) and a fungicide (dodine). Eggs were transplanted to the treated pollen and larvae were allowed to feed on the pollen stores after egg hatch. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated pollen were measured until adult eclosion. This year-long study revealed that chronic exposure to all tested pesticides delayed larval development and lowered larval and adult body weights. Additionally, exposure to the systemic fungicide resulted in abnormal larval defecation and increased mortality at the pupal stage, indicating potential risk to bees from fungicide exposure. These findings demonstrate potential threats to solitary bees from systemic insecticides and fungicides and will help in making policy decisions to mitigate these effects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170048,915,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,

In contrast to single applications of plant protection products (PPP), the effects of tank mixtures of two or more PPP on honey bees are not routinely assessed in the risk assessment of plant protection products. However, tank mixes are often common practice by farmers. Mixtures of practically non-toxic substances can lead to synergistic increase of toxic effects on honey bees, observed for the first time in 19921 in combinations of pyrethroids and azole fungicides. 2004 Iwasa et al. already reported that ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides strongly increase the toxicity of neonicotinoids in laboratory for the contact exposure route. Furthermore, in agricultural practice additives, adjuvants and fertilizers may be added to the spray solution. For these additives usually no informations on potential side effects on bees are available when mixed with plant protection products. Therefore, it is considered necessary to investigate possible additive or synergistic impacts and evaluate potentially critical combinations to ensure protection of bees. Here, we investigated the effects on bees of combinations of insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers under controlled laboratory conditions. A spray chamber was used to evaluate effects following contact exposure by typical field application rates. Subsequently, mortality and behaviour of bees were monitored for at least 48 h following the OECD acute contact toxicity test 2143.

Temperature sensitive effects of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) foraging behaviour,673,JOUR,"['Kolano, P.J.', 'Borgå, K.', 'Nielsen, A.']",Journal of Pollination Ecology,"Pollinating insects are an inherent part of most terrestrial ecosystems as they provide a crucial service for most angiosperms, including numerous important crops. A decrease in pollinator populations can therefore have severe consequences for both natural ecosystems and agricultural yields. Pesticide usage has been pointed out as one of the drivers behind pollinator declines. Globally, neonicotinoids are one of the most commonly used insecticides and studies have shown that exposure at sublethal levels can alter foraging behaviour, ultimately negatively affecting survival. Using a custom-made bumblebee colony monitoring system, we examined how the number and duration of foraging bouts of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) on an individual level was affected by exposure to low (6.5 μg/L) and high (10.2 μg/L) sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin via nectar. We also examined possible interaction between clothianidin exposure and abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and its impact on foraging bout number and duration. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of clothianidin increased foraging bout duration in bumblebees. Furthermore, the foraging bout duration decreased with increasing temperature at both exposure concentrations, whereas the unexposed control group was not affected by temperature. Neither number of foraging bouts nor the daily rhythm of foraging bout duration was affected by clothianidin exposure or temperature. The foraging bout duration decreased with increasing precipitation in both exposed and non-exposed groups. However, we did not find any interaction between precipitation and exposure, suggesting that precipitation does not affect toxicity. Our study shows the importance of semi-natural experiments and accounting for ambient factors when assessing the risk that pesticide exposure may present to pollinators. We conclude that the effect of clothianidin exposure on bumblebee foraging behaviour is temperature sensitive and that local climatic conditions and future climate change scenarios should be considered in risk assessments of clothianidin and other insecticides. © 2021 Journal of Pollination Ecology.

Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially ""bee-safe"" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees.",2021,10.3390/insects12040357,12,,0,,1.0,,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,,,

However, thiamethoxam was the main stressor associated to a significant decrease in AHB survivorship, whereas N. ceranae was the main stressor affecting their humoral immune response by upregulating the expression of the gene AmHym-1. Additionally, both stressors, separately and combined, significantly decreased the concentration of haemocytes in the haemolymph of the bees.

We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days. Our results demonstrate that N. perilampoides stingless bees are extremely sensitive to imidacloprid, even at low concentrations, and provide greater insight into how stingless bees respond to pesticide toxicity. This is the first study of its kind to look at detoxification systems and immune responses in Mexican stingless bees, an ecologically and economically important taxon. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,10.3390/insects13110972,13,,0,,1.0,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,
"The Neonicotinoid Imidacloprid Impairs Learning, Locomotor Activity Levels, and Sucrose Solution Consumption in Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)",114,JOUR,"['Paus-Knudsen, JS', 'Sveinsson, HA', 'Grung, M', 'Borgå, K', 'Nielsen, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Bumblebees carry out the complex task of foraging to provide for their colonies. They also conduct pollination, an ecosystem service of high importance to both wild plants and entomophilous crops. Insecticides can alter different aspects of bumblebee foraging behavior, including the motivation to leave the hive, finding the right flowers, handling flowers, and the ability to return to the colony. In the present study, we assessed how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid affects bumblebees' foraging behavior after exposure to four different treatment levels, including field-realistic concentrations (0 [control], 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L), through sucrose solution over 9 days. We observed the behavior of several free-flying bumblebees simultaneously foraging on artificial flowers in a flight arena to register the bees' complex behavior postexposure. To conduct a detailed assessment of how insecticides affect bumblebee locomotor behavior, we used video cameras and analyzed the recordings using computer vision. We found that imidacloprid impaired learning and locomotor activity level when the bumblebees foraged on artificial flowers. We also found that imidacloprid exposure reduced sucrose solution intake and storage. By using automated analyses of video recordings of bumblebee behavior, we identified sublethal effects of imidacloprid exposure at field-realistic doses. Specifically, we observed negative impacts on consumption of sucrose solution as well as on learning and locomotor activity level. Our results highlight the need for more multimodal approaches when assessing the sublethal effects of insecticides and plant protection products in general. Environ Toxicol Chem 2023;00:1-9.

The Neonicotinoid Insecticide Imidacloprid Disrupts Bumblebee Foraging Rhythms and Sleep,237,JOUR,"['Tasman, K', 'Rands, SA', 'Hodge, JJL']",ISCIENCE,"Neonicotinoids have been implicated in the large declines observed in insects such as bumblebees, an important group of pollinators. Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication. Here we show that exposure to the field-relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid caused a reduction in bumblebee foraging activity, locomotion, and foraging rhythmicity. Foragers showed an increase in day-time sleep and an increase in the proportion of activity occurring at night. This could reduce foraging and pollination opportunities, reducing the ability of the colony to grow and reproduce, endangering bee populations and crop yields.",2020,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101827,23,,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Many studies describing negative effects have been criticized as the experimental protocol did not perfectly simulate real-life field scenarios. Here, we placed free-flying bumblebee colonies next to raspberry crops that were either untreated or treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid as part of normal farming practice. Colonies were exposed to the raspberry crops for a two week period before being relocated to either a flower rich or flower-poor site. Overall, exposed colonies were more likely to die prematurely, and those that survived reached a lower final weight and produced 46% fewer reproductives than colonies placed at control farms. The impact was more marked at the flower-rich site (all colonies performed poorly at the flower poor site). Analysis of nectar and pollen stores from bumblebee colonies placed at the same raspberry farms revealed thiacloprid residues of up to 771 ppb in pollen and up to 561 ppb in nectar.

The Toxicity Test of Synthetic Insecticides on Tetragonula laeviceps (Apidae: Meliponini),447,JOUR,"['Hasanah, I.R.', 'Mubin, N.', 'Sartiami, D.', 'Priawandiputra, W.']",HAYATI Journal of Biosciences,"Intense insecticide application is thought to cause a decline in bee colonies worldwide. Bees are effective pollinators in increasing the production of agricultural commodities. The stingless bee Tetragonula laeviceps (Apidae: Meliponini) is widely cultivated and found around plantations. The insecticides used in the toxicity test were imidacloprid 200 g/L, fipronil 50 g/L, lambda-cyhalothrin 25 g/L, profenofos 500 g/L, and chlorantraniliprole 50 g/L followed by a semi-field test using imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides on the cucumber plant. The LC50 value showed that exposure to imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides caused toxic effects on T. laeviceps by contact and orally. Lambda-cyhalothrin was found harmful on contact exposure, in contrast, chlorantraniliprole was harmful through oral. Classification of insecticide toxicity based on LD50 contact for imidacloprid, fipronil, lambda-cyhalothrin, and profenofos were very toxic and needed a risk assessment. However, chlorantraniliprole was classified as moderately toxic and low risk. In semi-field test results, imidacloprid and fipronil insecticides caused a significant decrease in the leave-return and bee-visiting activity on cucumber flowers. These insecticides also produced a low average yield of fruit weight.

The Utility of a Bumble Bee (Bombus spp. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) Brood Test for Evaluating the Effects of Pesticides,1046,JOUR,"['Krueger, AJ', 'Early, TM', 'Ripperger, RJ', 'Cabrera, AR', 'Schmehl, DR']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Risk assessment for chemicals in the United States relies upon the honey bee (Apis meliffera L. [Hymenoptera: Apidael) as a surrogate for other bee species. There is uncertainty in extrapolating honey bee toxicity data to bumble bees due to differences in life history strategies, food consumption, and nest structure. Here we evaluated the design of a queenless bumble bee microcolony test that could be considered for generating larval toxicity data. Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony. Our data suggest that the microcolony study is only appropriate to assess brood effects to bumble bees for substances with low toxicity to adults, as demonstrated with diflubenzuron.

The combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to thiamethoxam on the performance of bumblebee micro-colonies,863,JOUR,"['Dance, C.', 'Botías, C.', 'Goulson, D.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the likely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2017,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.01.041,139,,0,,0.0,,0.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,,,
The development of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis is affected by some insecticide agrochemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations,616,JOUR,"['Mokkapati, J.S.', 'Bednarska, A.J.', 'Laskowski, R.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Solitary bees provide essential pollination services for many arable crops, but are prone to global decline. Agricultural intensification, which is connected with pesticide usage, is among major threats to bees and, thus, to the food security and ecosystem stability. As it may not be possible to cease pesticide usage currently because of the growing demand for food, it is crucial to understand the pesticide toxicities to bees for better protection of pollinator populations. The majority of studies have focused on social bees, and those on solitary bees studied effects of adult exposure, whereas these bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here, the effects of three commonly used insecticide-based plant protection products on the development of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis (red mason bee), were studied by exposing larvae to insecticide-contaminated multifloral pollen. The tested insecticides were: Dursban480EC, containing the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (CHP), Sherpa100EC, containing the pyrethroid cypermethrin (CYP), and Mospilan20SP with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid (ACT). When compared to the control larvae fed with uncontaminated-pollen, both CHP and CYP significantly reduced the O. bicornis larval survival and their body mass at all tested concentrations. In contrast, ACT did not affect either larval survival or body mass, but the length of larval stage to cocoon formation was significantly shortened compared to controls. None of studied insecticides affected the mass of cocooned individuals. However, at least 80% of individuals exposed to any of the tested insecticides died before reaching the adult stage, whereas 43% of the controls emerged successfully after overwintering. Although no clear monotonic dose-response relationships were found, our study showed that at least some insecticide formulations affect the development of O. bicornis even at concentrations actually found in pollen in the field, indicating an urgent need for revising current pesticide usage recommendations. © 2021 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145588,775,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,

Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36°C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20°C). At 20°C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36°C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced.

However, the visitation rate recovery for P. lineata was only detected in the less than the more intensive treatment after imidacloprid applications ceased. The fact that no differences in fruit production were detected between treatments (including control blocks) could result from a null net effect of the negative effects on pollinators and positive effects on pest control.

Fakulteit van de Landbouwkundige en Toegepaste Biologische Wetenschappen),"Spinosad is a novel insect control agent derived by fermentation of the Actinomycete bacterium, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood.

Previously, we found the insecticides imidacloprid and deltamethrin significantly reduced honeybee dancing and foraging efficiency. In our experiments, the duration of honeybee imbibing food at the feeder declined and the returning period from the feeder to the hive increased in both insecticide groups compared with the control group. As a follow-up, we performed a deep RNA-seq analysis to reveal the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this altered foraging performance. Genes involved in detoxification were upregulated in both the imidacloprid and the deltamethrin-treatment groups. Gene members in immune pathways, odorant receptors and major royal jelly protein families were significantly downregulated in the treatment groups compared with the controls.

They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers. We found numerous genes which show differential expression between neonicotinoid-treated bees and control bees, but no differentially methylated cytosines in any context. We found CpG methylation to be focused mainly in exons and associated with highly expressed genes.

The flavonoid rutin protects the bumble bee Bombus impatiens against cognitive impairment by imidacloprid and fipronil,561,JOUR,"['Riveros, A.J.', 'Gronenberg, W.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"The ongoing decline of bee populations and its impact on food security demands integrating multiple strategies. Sublethal impairments associated with exposure to insecticides, affecting the individual and the colony levels, have led to insecticide moratoria and bans. However, legislation alone is not sufficient and remains a temporary solution to an evolving market of insecticides. Here, we asked whether bees can be prophylactically protected against sublethal cognitive effects of two major neurotoxic insecticides, imidacloprid and fipronil, with different mechanisms of action. We evaluated the protective effect of the prophylactic administration of the flavonoid rutin, a secondary plant metabolite, present in nectar and pollen, and known for its neuroprotective properties. Following controlled or ad libitum administration of rutin, foragers of the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens received oral administration of the insecticides at sublethal realistic dosages. Learning acquisition, memory retention and decision speed were evaluated using olfactory absolute conditioning of the proboscis extension response. We show that the insecticides primarily impair acquisition but not retention or speed of the conditioned proboscis extension response. We further show that the administration of the flavonoid rutin successfully protects the bees against impairments produced by acute and chronic administration of insecticides. Our results suggest a new avenue for the protection of bees against sublethal cognitive effects of insecticides.  © 2022.

Toxicological assessment is therefore crucial for understanding the overall agrochemical risks to stingless bees. Therefore, the lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals commonly used in crops (copper sulfate, glyphosate, and spinosad) on the behavior and gut microbiota of the stingless bee, Partamona helleri, were assessed using chronic exposure during the larval stage. When used at the field-recommended rates, both copper sulfate (200 µg of active ingredient/bee; a.i µg bee−1) and spinosad (8.16 a.i µg bee−1) caused a decrease in bee survival, while glyphosate (148 a.i µg bee−1) did not show any significant effects. No significant adverse effects on bee development were observed in any treatment with CuSO4 or glyphosate, but spinosad (0.08 or 0.03 a.i µg bee −1) increased the number of deformed bees and reduced their body mass. Agrochemicals changed the behavior of bees and composition of the gut microbiota of adult bees, and metals such as copper accumulated in the bees’ bodies. The response of bees to agrochemicals depends on the class or dose of the ingested compound. In vitro rearing of stingless bees’ larvae is a useful tool to elucidate the sublethal effects of agrochemicals. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s11356-023-27385-4,30,,0,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,
The impact of four widely used neonicotinoid insecticides on Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille) (Hymenoptera: Apidae),768,JOUR,"['Jacob, C.R.D.O.', 'Zanardi, O.Z.', 'Malaquias, J.B.', 'Souza Silva, C.A.', 'Yamamoto, P.T.']",Chemosphere,"Application of neonicotinoid insecticides on crops can reduce the pollination services and population levels of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Neotropical agroecosystems. However, the impact of these insecticides on this bee has not been fully investigated. This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of ∼4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively. These results suggest that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula. These results can also help to develop strategies to conserve these pollinators in agroecosystems. © 2019",2019,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.02.105,224,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
The impact of pollen quality on the sensitivity of bumblebees to pesticides,719,JOUR,"['Barraud, A.', 'Vanderplanck, M.', 'Nadarajah, S.', 'Michez, D.']",Acta Oecologica,"With 2000 species currently recorded in Europe, bees are a highly diversified and efficient group of pollinating insects. Their decline could therefore lead to a risk for ecosystems functioning and crop yields. The drivers of this decline have been well documented in Europe and involve multiple factors such as pesticides, pathogens, poor nutrition, climate change, and their respective interactions. For pesticides, there is a lack of information concerning the impacts of exposure when the bees have access to pollen diet of different nutritional quality (e.g. variation in sterol and protein content). We performed bioassays on nine groups consisting of 10 Bombus terrestris microcolonies (i.e. queen less colonies) each in a fully crossed experiment including controls without pesticide, two different doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid (2 and 20 μg/L) and three pollen diets (i.e. Salix mix, cellulose-diluted Salix mix and cellulose-diluted Salix mix enriched with soy protein). All colonies were fed ad libitum with syrup and pollen. We measured the collection of pollen and syrup, the brood mass and the pollen efficacy (ratio of brood mass/pollen) at the end of the experiment. All these variables were affected by the imidacloprid doses, especially pollen efficacy, which was two and 10 times lower than the control for the 2 and 20 μg/L treatments, respectively. As expected, pollen efficacy was also affected by the pollen diet. However, when exposed to imidacloprid, the three different pollen diets did not affect micro-colonies performances. Overall, we show that diet quality does not affect sensitivity to imidacloprid exposure. It seems therefore that the negative effects of imidacloprid exposure cannot be compensated for by a pollen diet of high quality. © 2020",2020,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103552,105,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,

The study was conducted in three experimental groups: colonies from groups BE-5 and BE-200 were contaminated with 5 and 200 ppb of imidacloprid, respectively, via their food supply (syrup and pollen), while group BE was used as control (untreated). Bee samples were collected 3 and 10 weeks after feeding started. Protein concentration in bee tissue extracts was analyzed with reference: (a) to the dose of imidacloprid; and (b) duration of exposure to the chemical. The average quantity of protein content was significantly higher at the 3-week interval than in the 10-week interval and the bees from control colonies (BE) had significantly higher protein contents than contaminated bees (BE-5 and BE-200), even 3 weeks after feeding with imidacloprid started.

The insecticide imidacloprid is a partial agonist of the nicotinic receptor of honeybee Kenyon cells,295,JOUR,"['Déglise, P', 'Grünewald, B', 'Gauthier, M']",NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS,"The main targets of the insecticide imidacloprid are neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) within the insect brain. We tested the effects of imidacloprid on ligand-gated ion channels of cultured Kenyon cells of the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Kenyon cells build up the mushroom body neuropils, which are involved in higher order neuronal processes such as olfactory learning. We measured whole-cell currents through nicotinic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors using patch-clamp techniques. Pressure applications of imidacloprid elicited inward currents, which were irreversibly blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Imidacloprid was a partial nicotinic agonist, since it elicited only 36% of ACh-induced currents and competitively blocked 64% of the peak ACh-induced currents. GABA-induced currents were partially blocked when imidacloprid was coapplied and this block was independent upon activation of nAChRs. Our results identify the honeybee nAChR as a target of imidacloprid and an imidacloprid-induced inhibition of the insect GABA receptor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress.

The neonicotinoid acetamiprid reduces larval and adult survival in honeybees (Apis mellifera) and interacts with a fungicide mixture,399,JOUR,"['Manzer, S.', 'Thamm, M.', 'Hilsmann, L.', 'Krischke, B.', 'Steffan-Dewenter, I.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Environmental Pollution,"Plant protection products (PPPs), which are frequently used in agriculture, can be major stressors for honeybees. They have been found abundantly in the beehive, particularly in pollen. Few studies have analysed effects on honeybee larvae, and little is known about effects of insecticide-fungicide-mixtures, although this is a highly realistic exposure scenario. We asked whether the combination of a frequently used insecticide and fungicides would affect developing bees. Honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera carnica) were reared in vitro on larval diets containing different PPPs at two concentrations, derived from residues found in pollen. We used the neonicotinoid acetamiprid, the combined fungicides boscalid/dimoxystrobin and the mixture of all three substances. Mortality was assessed at larval, pupal, and adult stages, and the size and weight of newly emerged bees were measured. The insecticide treatment in higher concentrations significantly reduced larval and adult survival. Interestingly, survival was not affected by the high concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture. However, negative synergistic effects on adult survival were caused by the low concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture, which had no effect when applied alone. The lower concentrated combined fungicides led to significantly lighter adult bees, although the survival was unaffected. Our results suggest that environmental relevant concentrations can be harmful to honeybees. To fully understand the interaction of different PPPs, more combinations and concentrations should be studied in social and solitary bees with possibly different sensitivities. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124643,360,,0,,1.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,

Sublethal doses might, therefore, impair neural processes necessary for adaptive experience dependent behaviour and thus reduce the fitness of pollinating insects on the individual and community level. First, the question was addressed whether clothianidin has an aversive taste for honey bees and concluded with both a laboratory and a semi-field experiment that bees are unable to distinguish between control and contaminated sucrose solutions. In the laboratory, proboscis extension response conditioning was performed with forager bees exposed to different concentrations of clothianidin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.8 ng/bee)before learning, after learning during memory consolidation, and just before memory retention. These tests at different timings allowed uncovering an impairment of the consolidation and retrieval of memory due to the exposure to clothianidin.

Solitary Hymenoptera are also very important ecosystem service providers, but the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids have not yet been studied well in those animals. We analyzed the ability of walking Osmia to remember a feeding place in a small environment and found that Osmia remembers the feeding place well after 4 days of training. Uptake of field-realistic amounts of the neonicotinoid clothianidin (0.76 ng per bee) altered the animals' sensory responses to the visual environment and interfered with the retrieval of navigational memory.

The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation,921,JOUR,"['Zhang, E.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory - cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 μg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 μg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. © 2015.

We recorded the number of bees in each treatment group that resumed sonication behavior after consuming imidacloprid, and re-measured sonication and flight behavior for these bees. We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515 ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid.

Bees were exposed for 72 h to nominal concentrations of 25 and 250 ng/bee via sucrose solution. Determined residue concentrations by LC-MS/MS were 0.59 and 5.49 ng/bee, respectively. Thiacloprid exposure led to 5 and 71 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as metabolism enzymes and transporters were altered at 5.49 ng/bee. Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that mitochondrial ribosome proteins, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and additional metabolic pathways were altered. Among 21 genes assessed by RT-qPCR, the transcript of farnesol dehydrogenase involved in juvenile hormone III synthesis was significantly down-regulated. Transcripts of cyp6a14-like and apolipophorin-II like protein, cytochrome oxidase (cox17) and the non-coding RNA (LOC102654625) were significantly up-regulated at 5.49 ng/bee.

While environmental pollutants are well known to reduce fertility, the potential effects of common neonicotinoid insecticides on insect fertility remain poorly understood. Here, we show that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can drastically impact male insect fertility. In the laboratory, male and female solitary bees Osmia cornuta were exposed to four concentrations of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam to measure survival, food consumption, and sperm traits. Despite males being exposed to higher dosages of thiamethoxam, females revealed an overall increased hazard rate for survival; suggesting sex-specific differences in toxicological sensitivity. All tested sublethal concentrations (i.e., 1.5, 4.5 and 10 ng g−1) reduced sperm quantity by 57% and viability by 42% on average, with the lowest tested concentration leading to a reduction in total living sperm by 90%. As the tested sublethal concentrations match estimates of global neonicotinoid pollution, this reveals a plausible mechanism for population declines, thereby reflecting a realistic concern.

This defense can be weakened by environmental factors that may render honey bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Honey bees are frequently exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are being discussed as one of the stress factors that may lead to colony failure. We investigated the sublethal effects of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin on individual immunity, by studying three major aspects of immunocompetence in worker bees: total hemocyte number, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. In laboratory experiments, we found a strong impact of all three neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid (24 h oral exposure, 200 μg/l or 2000. μg/l) and imidacloprid (1 μg/l or 10 μg/l) reduced hemocyte density, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity even at field realistic concentrations.

"The novel butenolide pesticide flupyradifurone does not alter responsiveness to sucrose at either acute or chronic short-term field-realistic doses in the honey bee, Apis mellifera",178,JOUR,"['Bell, HC', 'Benavides, JE', 'Montgomery, CN', 'Navratil, JRE', 'Nieh, JC']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids, a popular class of agricultural pesticides, can lead to behavioral effects that impact the health of pollinators. Therefore, new compounds, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), have recently been developed as 'safer' alternatives. FPF is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, similar to neonicotinoids. Given the novelty of FPF, what data exist are focused mostly on assessing the effect of FPF on pollinator mortality. One important avenue for investigation is the potential effect of FPF on the sensitivity of nectar foragers, such as Apis mellifera, to sucrose concentrations. Neonicotinoids can alter this sucrose responsiveness and disrupt foraging. Compounding this effect, neonicotinoid-containing solutions are preferred by A. mellifera over pure sucrose solutions. We therefore conducted four studies, administering FPF under both acute and chronic conditions, and at field-realistic and higher than field-realistic doses, to assess the influence of FPF exposure on sucrose responsiveness and sucrose solutions with FPF in A. mellifera nectar foragers. RESULTS We found no evidence that FPF exposure under acute or chronic field-realistic conditions significantly altered sucrose responsiveness, and we did not find that bees exposed to FPF consumed more of the solution. However, at the much higher median lethal dose (48 h), among bees that survived, FPF-exposed foragers responded to significantly lower concentrations of sucrose than controls and responded at significantly higher rates to all concentrations of sucrose than controls. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that FPF alters the sucrose responsiveness of nectar foragers at field-realistic doses during winter or early spring, but caution and further investigation are warranted, particularly on the effects of FPF in conjunction with other stressors.

The novel insecticides flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor do not act synergistically with viral pathogens in reducing honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival but sulfoxaflor modulates host immunocompetence,663,JOUR,"['Al Naggar, Y.', 'Paxton, R.J.']",Microbial Biotechnology,"The decline of insect pollinators threatens global food security. A major potential cause of decline is considered to be the interaction between environmental stressors, particularly between exposure to pesticides and pathogens. To explore pesticide–pathogen interactions in an important pollinator insect, the honey bee, we used two new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (SULF), at sublethal and field-realistic doses in a fully crossed experimental design with three common viral honey bee pathogens, Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) genotypes A and B. Through laboratory experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination to individual insects, we recorded harmful effects of FPF and pathogens on honey bee survival and immune gene expression. Though we found no evidence of synergistic interactions among stressors on either honey bee survival or viral load, the combined treatment SULF and DWV-B led to a synergistic upregulation of dicer-like gene expression. We conclude that common viral pathogens pose a major threat to honey bees, while co-exposure to these novel nACHR insecticides does not significantly exacerbate viral impacts on host survival in the laboratory. © 2020 The Authors.

We therefore studied the effects of a relatively new pesticide, flupyradifurone (FLU), which has been developed, in part, because it appears safer for honey bees than neonicotinoids. We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 mu g/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 mu g/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 mu g/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls. FLU at higher doses resulted in similar learning impairments.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the biopesticide azadirachtin on the survival, behavior, morphology, development, and reproduction of queens of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese, 1900). The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a toxic reference standard. Queens were orally exposed in vitro to a contaminated diet (containing azadirachtin and imidacloprid) during development. Azadirachtin resulted in reduced survival, similarly to imidacloprid, altered development time, caused deformations, and reduced the size of the queens’ reproductive organs. All of these factors could potentially compromise colony survival.

In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes, bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed.

The stingless bee Trigona spinipes (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is at risk from a range of insecticides via direct ingestion and trophallactic exchanges,129,JOUR,"['Pereira, RC', 'Vieira, JOL Jr', 'Barcelos, JVPL', 'Peçanha, LS', 'França, TA', 'Mendonca, LVP', 'da Silva, WR', 'Samuels, RI', 'Silva, GA']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: The stingless bee, Trigona spinipes, is an important pollinator of numerous native and cultivated plants. Trigona spinipes populations can be negatively impacted by insecticides commonly used for pest control in crops. However, this species has been neglected in toxicological studies. Here we observed the effects of seven insecticides on the survival of bees that had fed directly on insecticide-contaminated food sources or received insecticides via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates. The effects of insecticides on flight behavior were also determined for the compounds considered to be of low toxicity. RESULTS: Imidacloprid, spinosad and malathion were categorized as highly toxic to T. spinipes, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin, methomyl and chlorfenapyr were of medium to low toxicity and interfered with two aspects of flight behavior evaluated here. Chlorantraniliprole was the only insecticide tested here that had no significant effect on T. spinipes survival, although it did interfere with one aspect of flight capacity. A single bee that had ingested malathion, spinosad or imidacloprid, could contaminate three, four and nineteen other bees, respectively via trophallaxis, resulting in the death of the recipients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the ecotoxicology of a range of insecticides that not only negatively affected T. spinipes survival, but also interfered with flight capacity, a very important aspect of pollination behavior. The toxicity of the insecticides was observed following direct ingestion and also via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates, highlighting the possibility of lethal effects of these insecticides spreading throughout the colony, reducing the survival of non-foraging individuals.

The sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor exposure reduces the survival status and disrupts the intestinal metabolism of the honeybee Apis mellifera,496,JOUR,"['Cheng, S.', 'Dai, P.', 'Li, R.', 'Chen, Z.', 'Liang, P.', 'Xie, X.', 'Zhen, C.', 'Gao, X.']",Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are indispensable pollinators in agricultural production, biodiversity conservation, and nutrients provision. The abundance and diversity of honeybees have been rapidly diminishing, possibly related to the extensive use of insecticides in ecosystems. Sulfoxaflor is a novel sulfoximine insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. However, few studies have addressed the negative effects of sulfoxaflor on honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, adult workers were fed a 50% (w/v) of sugar solution containing different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor for two weeks consecutively. The survival rates, food intake, and body weight of the honeybees significantly decreased after continuous exposure at higher doses (0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor when compared with the control. The change in the metabolites in the honeybee gut was determined using high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics on day 14 after sulfoxaflor treatment. The results revealed that 24 and 105 metabolites changed after exposure to 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L sulfoxaflor, respectively, compared with that of the control groups. A total of 12 changed compounds including pregenolone and glutathione were detected as potential biomarkers, which were eventually found to be enriched in pathways of the steroid hormone biosynthesis (p = 0.0001) and glutathione metabolism (p = 0.021). These findings provide a new perspective on the physiological influence of sulfoxaflor stress in honeybees. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2023,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130109,442,,0,1.0,,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
The survival and flight capacity of commercial honeybees and endangered stingless bees are impaired by common agrochemicals,452,JOUR,"['Gomes, I.N.', 'Gontijo, L.M.', 'Lima, M.A.P.', 'Zanuncio, J.S.', 'Resende, H.C.']",Ecotoxicology,"The impact of agrochemicals on native Brazilian bees may be underestimated, since studies of non-target effects on bees have, by and large, concerned mostly the Apis mellifera L. Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate – Roundup®], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity. Taken altogether, the results highlight the importance of testing the impact of multiple agrochemicals (i.e. not just insecticides) through different routes of exposure in order to understand more comprehensively the potential risks for Apis and non-Apis bees. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02699-8,32,,0,,1.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,

With the advancement of agricultural modernisation, the large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides is one of the main factors leading to the decline of bees. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. Acute (48 h) oral toxicity tests showed that a 5% lethal concentration (LC5 ) was 0.220 mg/L, and a 20% lethal concentration (LC20 ) was 0.458 mg/L. The gene expression profile shows that when compared with the control group, the LC5 group induced 206 significantly upregulated, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 363 significantly downregulated DEGs, while the LC20 group induced 180 significantly upregulated DEGs and 419 significantly downregulated DEGs. Significantly, transcriptomic analysis revealed DEGs involved in immunity, detoxification, and the nervous system, such as antimicrobial peptides, vitellogenin, synaptotagmin-10, AChE-2, and nAChRa9. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways.

Further, changes in honeybee gut microbial community were examined using next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on day 1, 7, and 13 of the exposure. When compared to control-treatment, continuous exposure to high (0.6 mg/L) and very high (2.0 mg/L) concentrations of thiacloprid significantly reduced percentage survival of honeybees (p < 0.001) and led to dysbiosis of their gut microbial community on day 7 of the exposure. However, during subsequent developmental stages of middle-aged honeybees (i.e. on day 13), their gut microbiome recovered from dysbiosis that occurred previously due to thiacloprid exposure.

Thiacloprid impairs honeybee worker learning and memory with inducing neuronal apoptosis and downregulating memory-related genes,455,JOUR,"['Li, A.', 'Yin, L.', 'Ke, L.', 'Diao, Q.-Y.', 'Wu, Y.', 'Dai, P.', 'Liu, Y.-J.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Neonicotinoids are among the most widely used insecticides in the world and are recognized as a potential cause of pollinator decline. Previous studies have demonstrated that the neonicotinoid thiacloprid has adverse effects on foraging and memory behaviors. However, there is no direct evidence linking thiacloprid-induced neuronal cell damage in the brains of honeybees to learning and memory dysfunction. Adult honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers were chronically exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid. We discovered that thiacloprid negatively affected their survival, food consumption, and body weight. In addition, sucrose sensitivity and memory performance were impaired. We evaluated the apoptosis of honeybee brain cells using TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) and Caspase-3 assays, which revealed that thiacloprid increases the dose-dependent apoptosis of neurons in the mushroom bodies (MB) and antennal lobes (AL). We also determined the abnormal transcripts of multiple genes, including vitellogenin (Vg), immune system genes (apidaecin and catalase), and memory-associated genes (pka, creb, Nmdar1, Dop2, Oa1, Oa-2R, and Oa-3R). These results indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid cause abnormal expression of memory-related genes and apoptosis of brain cells in the AL and MB, which may contribute to the memory disorder induced by thiacloprid exposure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163820,885,,0,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

Thiamethoxam and picoxystrobin reduce the survival and overload the hepato-nephrocitic system of the Africanized honeybee,41,JOUR,"['Domingues, CEC', 'Abdalla, FC', 'Balsamo, PJ', 'Pereira, BVR', 'Hausen, MD', 'Costa, MJ', 'Silva-Zacarin, ECM']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Apis mellifera perform important pollination roles in agroecosystems. However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./mu L) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./mu L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Thiamethoxam as an inadvertent anti-aphrodisiac in male bees,602,JOUR,"['Straub, L.', 'Minnameyer, A.', 'Camenzind, D.', 'Kalbermatten, I.', 'Tosi, S.', 'Van Oystaeyen, A.', 'Wäckers, F.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Strobl, V.']",Toxicology Reports,"Sexual reproduction is common to almost all multi-cellular organisms and can be compromised by environmental pollution, thereby affecting entire populations. Even though there is consensus that neonicotinoid insecticides can impact non-target animal fertility, their possible impact on male mating success is currently unknown in bees. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid significantly reduces both mating success and sperm traits of male bumblebees. Sexually mature male Bombus terrestris exposed to a field-realistic concentration of thiamethoxam (20 ng g−1) or not (controls) were mated with virgin gynes in the laboratory. The results confirm sublethal negative effects of thiamethoxam on sperm quantity and viability. While the latency to mate was reduced, mating success was significantly impaired in thiamethoxam-exposed males by 32% probably due to female choice. Gynes mated by exposed males revealed impaired sperm traits compared to their respective controls, which may lead to severe constraints for colony fitness. Our laboratory findings demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male mating success in bees. Given that holds true for the field, this provides a plausible mechanism contributing to declines of wild bee populations globally. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may therefore have previously overlooked inadvertent anti-aphrodisiac effects on non-target animals, thereby limiting conservation efforts. © 2021 The Authors",2022,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.12.003,9,,0,,1.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
Thiamethoxam exposure deregulates short ORF gene expression in the honey bee and compromises immune response to bacteria,618,JOUR,"['Decio, P.', 'Ustaoglu, P.', 'Derecka, K.', 'Hardy, I.C.W.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Mongan, N.', 'Stöger, R.', 'Soller, M.']",Scientific Reports,"Maximizing crop yields relies on the use of agrochemicals to control insect pests. One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria. Our findings imply a synergistic mechanism for the observed bee population declines that concern agriculturists, conservation ecologists and the public. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,10.1038/s41598-020-80620-7,11,,0,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,

The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117 μg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141 μg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102 μg thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50 μg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43 μg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

"Thiamethoxam impairs honey bee visual learning, alters decision times, and increases abnormal behaviors",730,JOUR,"['Ludicke, J.C.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Learning is important for honey bee fitness and the pollination services that they provide. Neonicotinoid pesticides impair learning, fitness, colony health, and pollination, but most studies on how they affect bee learning have focused on olfactory learning. We tested the effects of field realistic doses of 0.8 ng/bee and 1.34 ng/bee of the neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam (TMX), on bee visual learning. We adapted a T-maze bioassay and classically conditioned bees to associate sugar reward with a simulated flower color (blue or yellow light) in a choice assay. At 1.34 ng/bee, TMX significantly reduced correct choices in the final learning trial as compared to the control treatment. There was no TMX effect in our 1-h memory test. We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices. Behaviors (falling, trembling, and rapid abnormal movements) were significantly increased by both TMX doses as compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on bee visual learning should be further studied and incorporated into Risk Assessment protocols. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110367,193,,0,1.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,
"Thiamethoxam toxicity on the stingless bee Friesiomelitta varia: LC50, survival time, and enzymatic biomarkers assessment",411,JOUR,"['de Souza, F.C.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Maloni, G.', 'Otero, I.V.R.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Chemosphere,"Bees play a crucial role as pollinating insects in both natural and cultivated areas. However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/μL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen. GST activity showed differences in the abdomen after one and five days of thiamethoxam exposure. These findings suggests that the abdomen is more affected than the head after oral exposure to thiamethoxam. Our study provides evidence of the toxicity of thiamethoxam at both the cellular and organismal levels, reinforcing the need to include non-Apis species in pollinator risk assessments. and provide solid arguments for bee protection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142853,363,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,
Thiamethoxam: Assessing flight activity of honeybees foraging on treated oilseed rape using radio frequency identification technology,912,JOUR,"['Thompson, H.', 'Coulson, M.', 'Ruddle, N.', 'Wilkins, S.', 'Harkin, S.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The present study was designed to assess homing behavior of bees foraging on winter oilseed rape grown from seed treated with thiamethoxam (as Cruiser OSR), with 1 field drilled with thiamethoxam-treated seed and 2 control fields drilled with fungicide-only-treated seed. Twelve honeybee colonies were used per treatment group, 4 each located at the field edge (on-field site), at approximately 500m and 1000m from the field. A total of nearly 300 newly emerged bees per colony were fitted (tagged) with Mic3 radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders and introduced into each of the 36 study hives. The RFID readers fitted to the entrances of the test colonies were used to monitor the activity of the tagged bees for the duration of the 5-wk flowering period of the crop. These activity data were analyzed to assess any impact on flight activity of bees foraging on the treated compared with untreated crops. Honeybees were seen to be actively foraging within all 3 treatment groups during the exposure period. The data for the more than 3000 RFID-tagged bees and more than 90000 foraging flights monitored throughout the exposure phase for the study follow the same trends across the treatment and controls and at each of the 3 apiary distances, indicating that there were no effects from foraging on the treated crop. Under the experimental conditions, there was no effect of foraging on thiamethoxam-treated oilseed rape on honeybee flight activity or on their ability to return to the hive.

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2–3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. The feeding study data are also compared to the outcomes of regulatory Tier 1 risk assessments conducted using guidance provided by the USA, Canada, Brazil and the EU regulatory authorities. We propose an adaptation of the European chronic adult bee risk assessment that takes into account the full dataset generated in laboratory studies while still providing an order of magnitude of safety compared with the colony feeding study NOEC. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.003,654,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Towards the comparative ecotoxicology of bees: the response-response relationship,1030,CONF,"['Cresswell, JE', 'Laycock, I']",HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES TO BEES: 11TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF THE ICP-PR BEE PROTECTION GROUP,"Background: When an ecological system is exposed to an anthropogenic toxin, each species has an idiosyncratic sensitivity, but it is reasonable to expect some generality in response, especially among related species such as bees. If two species are similarly sensitive to a toxin their dose-response relationships will be similar. We propose a method to facilitate comparison between dose-response relationships, namely the response-response relationship, which can be applied to any biomarkers whose responses to the same pollutant are measured across a similar range of doses. We apply the method to bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) exposed to a dietary pesticide, imidacloprid, and we investigate both lethal and sublethal biomarkers. Results: We found cross-species similarity in dose-dependent responses, but only in certain sublethal biomarkers. In honey bees, sublethal biomarkers were more sensitive than mortality. In bumble bees, fecundity was the most sensitive biomarker. Conclusion: Our results provisionally suggest the existence of cross-species generalities. The greater sensitivity of sublethal biomarkers than mortality suggests that testing protocols which are overly focussed on mortality may underestimate the ecological impacts of toxic pollutants.",2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.010,437,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,

Separate groups of bees were left for 24 h to feed on 50% sucrose solution containing different concentrations of the tested insecticides, and the lethal concentration that caused 50% mortality (LC50) was estimated. The inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities as biochemical indicators were determined in vivo after 24 h in head, thorax, and abdomen of surviving bees obtained after treatments with a view to explore the possible mode of action of these compounds. Results indicated that exposure to spinosad showed toxicity to honey bees with LC50 value of 7.34 mg L-1, followed by oxymatrine (LC50 = 10.68 mg L -1), while chlorfluazuron was the least acutely toxic of the tested compounds (LC50 = 2,526 mg L-1). Oxymatrine and spinosad at the same tested concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1) significantly inhibited AChE activity in different organs of honey bee workers, and high inhibition percentage was obtained with the enzyme isolated from the thorax. However, chlorfluazuron at 400, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 mg L -1 caused high inhibition of AChE activity isolated from the head (39.65% and 44.22% at 2,000 and 4,000 mg L-1, respectively). In addition, the toxic effects of the tested compounds on activity of ATPase indicated that spinosad caused the highest inhibitory effect in different organs compared with oxymatrine at the same concentrations, and high inhibition was found with ATPase isolated from the head. The results also indicated that oxymatrine was the least active compound for inhibition of AChE and ATPase. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2010,10.1007/s00244-009-9403-y,58,,0,,0.0,1.0,,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,

Effect of 11 insecticides (chlorpyriphos, treban, methyl-parathion, triazophos, ethion, thiodicarb, carbosulfan, diflubenzuron, flufenoxuron, azadirachtin and imidacloprid) was studied on A. dorsata. LD50 values and safety index (S. I.) of these insecticides were studied. Insecticides were applied in two ways - topical method and mass feeding method. Treban proved to be the most toxic insecticide (LD50=0.000028 μg/bee) in acute contact toxicity test. Methyl-parathion was anticipated to be the most hazardous to the honey bees in case of acute stomach toxicity test (NRC=0.1, S. I.=0.00123).

Among these pesticides are those that are highly toxic to Apis mellifera (honey bees). However, little non-Apis bee species toxicity data exist; especially pertaining to beef cattle feed yard-derived pesticides. Therefore, we conducted a series of 96-h contact toxicity tests with blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria) using three neonicotinoids, two pyrethroids, and two macrocyclic lactones. Neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and clothianidin) were most toxic with LD50 values ranging from 2.88 to 26.35 ng/bee, respectively. Macrocyclic lactones (abamectin and ivermectin) were also highly toxic to O. lignaria with LD50 estimates of 5.51–32.86 ng/bee. Pyrethroids (permethrin and bifenthrin) were relatively less toxic with LD50 values greater than 33 ng/bee. Sensitivity ratios for each pesticide were calculated to relate O. lignaria LD50 values to existing honey bee toxicity data. All three neonicotinoids were more toxic to O. lignaria than A. mellifera, but pyrethroids and abamectin were relatively less toxic. Additionally, three of seven pesticides (43%) resulted in significantly different mass normalized LD50 values for male and female O. lignaria. These results indicate that non-Apis pollinators may be highly susceptible to pesticides originating from beef cattle feed yards, necessitating consideration of more stringent regulatory protections than those based on A. mellifera pesticide sensitivity. © 2020 The Authors",2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111681,208,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Toxic temperatures: Bee behaviours exhibit divergent pesticide toxicity relationships with warming,154,JOUR,"['Kenna, D', 'Graystock, P', 'Gill, RJ']",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Climate change and agricultural intensification are exposing insect pollinators to temperature extremes and increasing pesticide usage. Yet, we lack good quantification of how temperature modulates the sublethal effects of pesticides on behaviours vital for fitness and pollination performance. Consequently, we are uncertain if warming decreases or increases the severity of different pesticide impacts, and whether separate behaviours vary in the direction of response. Quantifying these interactive effects is vital in forecasting pesticide risk across climate regions and informing pesticide application strategies and pollinator conservation. This multi-stressor study investigated the responses of six functional behaviours of bumblebees when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) or a sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) across a standardised low, mid, and high temperature. We found the neonicotinoid had a significant effect on five of the six behaviours, with a greater effect at the lower temperature(s) when measuring responsiveness, the likelihood of movement, walking rate, and food consumption rate. In contrast, the neonicotinoid had a greater impact on flight distance at the higher temperature. Our findings show that different organismal functions can exhibit divergent thermal responses, with some pesticide-affected behaviours showing greater impact as temperatures dropped, and others as temperatures rose. We must therefore account for environmental context when determining pesticide risk. Moreover, we found evidence of synergistic effects, with just a 3 degrees C increase causing a sudden drop in flight performance, despite seeing no effect of pesticide at the two lower temperatures. Our findings highlight the importance of multi-stressor studies to quantify threats to insects, which will help to improve dynamic evaluations of population tipping points and spatiotemporal risks to biodiversity across different climate regions.",2023,10.1111/gcb.16671,29,,0,1.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,
Toxicity and biochemical changes in the honey bee Apis mellifera exposed to four insecticides under laboratory conditions,939,JOUR,"['Badawy, M.E.I.', 'Nasr, H.M.', 'Rabea, E.I.']",Apidologie,"The toxicity and biochemical changes in honey bees (Apis mellifera) treated with four insecticides—acetamiprid, dinotefuran, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl—were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Foraging bees were exposed to different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0.01-, 0.02-, 0.04-, 0.1-, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24 h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance. The results indicated that regardless of how the bees were exposed to insecticides, dinotefuran was extremely toxic to adult A. mellifera (topical LD50 = 0.0006 μg/bee and oral feeding LC50 = 1.29 mg/L). Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to dinotefuran at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and pymetrozine were relatively less toxic to bees (<25 % mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera. The biochemical analysis of carboxylesterase and GST showed that these enzymes detoxified the low doses of acetamiprid, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl, but not dinotefuran. Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",2015,10.1007/s13592-014-0315-0,46,,0,,0.0,,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

In this study, the effects of exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam on stingless bees Scaptotrigona bipunctata were evaluated. Foragers bees were exposed to the insecticide and subjected to genetic biochemical, histochemical, and morphological analyses after 24, 48, and 72 h of ingestion. Analysis of isoenzyme esterases revealed significant alterations in the relative activity of EST-4, a type II cholinesterase. Evaluation of the S. bipunctata brain revealed changes in the state of chromatin condensation according to the exposure time and concentration of neonicotinoid compared with the control. Morphological changes were observed in the midgut of this species at all concentrations and exposure times, which may interfere with various physiological processes of these insects. We can conclude that, although thiamethoxam at the concentrations evaluated did not cause high mortality, it induced concentration-dependent changes in bees by activating enzymes related with the protection for xenobiotic, internal morphology and probably these changes may lead to alterations in the activity of bees. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018,10.1002/tox.22533,33,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,

Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and >81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (>36, >49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee). The urea metabolite and 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited LD50 values of >99 500 and >121 500ng per bee, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the [3H]imidacloprid binding site in honeybee head membrane preparations is consistent with that anticipated for a nAChR.

Toxicity and poisoning symptoms of selected insecticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera mellifera L.),842,JOUR,"['Pashte, V.V.', 'Patil, C.S.']",Archives of Biological Sciences,"Bees are potential pollinators of wide variety of crops. The European dark bee, Apis mellifera mellifera (L.) is widely used for crop pollination. However, pesticide usage in modern agriculture has threatened the plant-bee pollinator interaction. There is lack of data regarding lethal time, insecticide concentration and poisoning symptoms, especially for formulated insecticides that are widely used in insect management. This study shows that the intrinsic toxicity of insecticides (LC50) to A. mellifera mellifera (L.) was in the following order: imidacloprid (0.0070) > fipronil (0.0125) > indoxacarb (0.0266) > cypermethrin (0.0370) > dimethoate (0.0385). The lethal time (LT50) values (h) in the ascending order of toxicity of insecticides were as follows: fipronil (6.56), cypermethrin (6.69), dimethoate (8.00), imidacloprid (9.85) and indoxacarb (13.45). Distinct poisoning symptoms observed in A. mellifera mellifera were extended proboscis, expanded wings, unhooked wings, extended legs and twisted bodies, defecation on cage covers, sting in release-out position and anus with excreta. All the tested pesticides are harmful to the honey bee except azadirachtin. The tested pesticides exhibited different poisoning symptoms in bees, which could be useful for beekeepers in identifying the cause of colony mortality. In conclusion, the pesticide toxicological research on bees is an important safety aspect for beneficial organisms.

On the other side, dipel and pyridalyl recording the highest LC                             50                              and LC                             90                              at all tested periods and the highest LT                             50                              and LT                             90                              at all tested concentrations. As for the application of pesticides in cotton fields, the tested pesticides significantly increased the number of dead workers in comparison with control. The tested pesticides significantly decreased bee foraging activities, i.e., number of foraging workers, number of worker collecting nectar, number of worker gathering pollen grains, area of broad workers, and honey bee yields. Dipel and pyridalyl were the most safety pesticides on honey bee workers in laboratory and field, so it could be introduced as a component in IPM programs of cotton pests.                          © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019,10.1007/s11356-018-04061-6,26,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
Toxicity evaluation of two insecticides on tetragonisca angustula and scaptotrigona xanthotricha (Hymenoptera: Apidae),822,JOUR,"['Quiroga-Murcia, D.E.', 'Zotti, M.J.', 'Zenner de Polanía, I.', 'Pech-Pech, E.E.']",Agronomia Colombiana,"Stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) have crucial roles in the ecosystem, offering pollination service and contributing to genetic diversity of species, and also providing honey and wax to humankind. Tetragonisca angustula and Scaptotrigona xanthotricha are species that have been used since ancient times for beekeeping. Currently these and other species have been exposed to agronomic practices, among which the use of synthetic pesticides used for crop protection stands out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of the insecticides thiamethoxam and fipronil, which are used in agriculture in several countries in the tropical and subtropical belt in order to establish the risk that these products represent to the survival of these two species. The oral and topical LD50 was obtained by Probit analysis. Comparisons with the LD50s of other stingless bees and Apis mellifera were realized. Although further studies are required to calculate the real risk of the two compounds, the results showed an evident susceptibility of both species. We concluded that it is essential to use tools and practices that reduce the risk, and perform toxicological evaluations of new and existing pesticides on stingless bees. © 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia1.

Recently, populations of honey bees have been declining due to a combination of factors, including the widespread use of agricultural pesticides. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute oral toxicity of different formulated pesticides to honey bee adults. In particular, we assessed the acute oral toxicity of two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, Assail 30SG and thiamethoxam, Actara 25WDG) and two other systemic insecticide products (sulfoxaflor, Closer 2SC and flupyradifurone, Sivanto 200SL), all of which are generally used in pest management programs in commercial apple orchards in the Eastern United States. Honey bees were fed a range of doses of each pesticide in order to create a response curve, and LC50, LC90, and LD50 values were determined. The pesticide formulation containing flupyradifurone as the active ingredient was found to be the least toxic to honey bees followed by the formulations containing sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid. The toxicity values obtained in this study differ from other studies testing only technical active ingredient compounds, suggesting the need to evaluate formulated products while conducting ecotoxicological risk assessment. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,10.3390/environments9070090,9,,0,0.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,

Biotest was conducted using eight concentrations with triplicates. The lethal concentration (LC50) was determined through oral exposure, and the oral lethal dose (LD50) was estimated based on dietary consumption values. The hazard quotient (HQ) was then calculated using the LD50 value. The LD50 value for imidacloprid Nortox 400 SC® at 6h was 0.025 μg a.i. bee-1. Regarding the environmental risk to the species, the acute oral HQ exceeded the trigger value by 200 to 480 times across all evaluated crops. Additionally, the risk of product drift exceeded the trigger value within 50 meters of harvest. These results suggest that, during phase 1, it was not possible to dismiss the possibility of foliar spraying affecting M. scutellaris bees. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

Each insecticide was evaluated at four different concentrations. The mortality of honeybees was counted after 3, 6, 12 and 24 hrs post exposure. The median lethal concentration (LC50) of each insecticide was determined for Apis mellifera L. The toxicity of insecticides increased with increase in concentration and exposure time to honeybees. The results obtained were statistically highly significant and indicate that spinosad and imidacloprid were most toxic with LC50 values of 13.5 and 16.6 ppm after 24 hrs post exposure to honeybees.

In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of botanical extracts with homemade preparations used in agroecological crops and their constituents on the bees Apis mellifera and Partamona helleri. Toxicity bioassays of adult bees were done by means of oral exposure and ingestion, using the insecticide imidacloprid as a positive control. Dietary consumption, respiration rate and bee flight were evaluated as sublethal parameters. Although some extracts were toxic to bees, survival was always higher compared to the results obtained with the imidacloprid, which was lethal to 100% of bees. In dietary consumption, P. helleri consumed less (5 mg/bee) in 3 h than A. mellifera (11 mg/bee), and P. helleri consumed less (7 mg/bee) in 24 h than A. mellifera (22 mg/bee). There was no difference in consumption of food containing plant extracts or food containing water only. We did not detect any adverse effects of the botanical extracts on bee respiration rates or flight. The major constituent of N. tabacum is nicotine (8.4–15.1%), in A. americana it is β-caryophyllene (11.3%), and in A. colubrina, lupeol (12.2%). Imidacloprid and nicotine were more toxic to bees (LC50 ≤ 1.3 and LC50 ≤ 44.3). Botanical extracts were selective to A. mellifera and the native bee P. helleri, and therefore, have the potential for ecofriendly pest control.

The current study evaluates the toxicity of six insecticides (emamectin benzoate, spinetoram, chlorantraniliprole, fipronil, flonicamid, and imidacloprid) against workers of A. florea. There were six concentrations of each insecticide (causing > 0% to < 100 % mortality) prepared in water, and each concentration was replicated four times.

However, the use of pesticides, specifically neonicotinoids, in agroecosystems has led to a decline in these pollinating organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the topical (contaminated mist) and residual (contaminated food) acute effect of the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) on a stingless bee species (native to Brazil) with wide geographical distribution (Tetragonisca angustula) and two species restricted to certain regions (Tetragonisca fiebrigi and Tetragonisca weyrauchi) to determine LC10–48 h and LC50–48 h. The bees were exposed to various concentrations of IMI, in both topical and residual effect tests, and the results showed that low concentrations of the insecticide adversely affected the survival of all three species, with T. angustula being the most sensitive. The study also compared the sensitivity of the three species to the standard insecticide Dimethoate, and the results confirmed that T. angustula was the most sensitive. The findings of this study provide crucial ecotoxicological information, particularly concerning the residual effects of neonicotinoids on stingless bees. This evidence reinforces the urgent need to expand research on the effects of neonicotinoids on these important pollinators, so commonly found in nature and meliponaries. In addition, this research contributes significantly to filling the existing knowledge gap about the effects of pesticides on bee species native to Brazil, bringing to light the potential risks that these chemicals pose to the survival of these pollinators and emphasizing the urgent need for efforts of conservation in favor of these precious pollinating agents. © 2023, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2023,10.1007/s13592-023-01043-7,54,0.0,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Oral and indirect contact trials were carried out on adult worker honey bees for each pesticide, using commercial formulations. The acute oral toxicity (AOT) LD50 and the acute indirect contact toxicity (ICT) LC50 were calculated. Mean AOT LD50 values at 24 hours (clothianidin 3.53 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 118.74 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.40 ng/honey bee), 48 hours (clothianidin 3.35 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 90.09 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.27 ng/honey bee), and 72 hours (clothianidin 3.28 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 69.68 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.16 ng/honey bee) from test start were of the same order of magnitude of those reported in the literature for all three neonicotinoids.

Total haemocyte counts were significantly higher for larvae and pupae but less for adult bees, however, differential haemocyte counts insignificantly different. Exposure of insecticides showed variable response for tested insecticides with immediate increased change with ethofenprox, diafenthiuron and imidacloprid but decreased for all tested insecticides after sixty minutes. For differential haemocyte counts, plasmatocytes and granulocytes increased with exposure of insecticides. Immune response of haemocytes against insecticides showed different degrees of abnormalities like agglutination, denucleation and cell shape distortion.

Attention was focused on bee survival, food consumption and oxidative stress. The effects on oxidative stress were assessed by deter-mining the activity of enzymes involved in antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) in the head, abdomen and midgut; oxidative damage reflected by both lipid per-oxidation and protein carbonylation was also evaluated. In general, no significant effect on food consumption was observed. Pesticide mixtures were more toxic than individual substances, and the highest mortalities were induced at intermediate doses of 0.1 and 1 µg/L. The toxicity was not always linked to the exposure level and the number of substances in the mixtures.

Toxicity of the insecticide sulfoxaflor alone and in combination with the fungicide fluxapyroxad in three bee species,593,JOUR,"['Azpiazu, C.', 'Bosch, J.', 'Bortolotti, L.', 'Medrzycki, P.', 'Teper, D.', 'Molowny-Horas, R.', 'Sgolastra, F.']",Scientific Reports,"The sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor is regarded as a potential substitute for neonicotinoids that were recently banned in the EU due to their side effects on bees. Like neonicotinoids, sulfoxaflor acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agricultural environments, bees are commonly exposed to combinations of pesticides, and neonicotinoids are known to interact synergistically with fungicides. The objective of our study is to assess the acute oral toxicity of sulfoxaflor alone and in combination with a single dose of fluxapyroxad, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide, in three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis. Because synergism may be dose-dependent, we tested a range of sulfoxaflor doses. Synergistic effects were assessed using three different approaches: Bliss criterion of drugs independence, ratio test comparing LD50s and model deviation ratio. Osmia bicornis was the most sensitive species to sulfoxaflor and both O. bicornis and A. mellifera showed significant synergism between the insecticide and the fungicide. For the most part, these synergistic effects were weak and only occurred at early assessment times and intermediate sulfoxaflor doses. The potential ecological relevance of these effects should be confirmed in field and/or cage studies. Overall, our laboratory results demonstrate that sulfoxaflor is somewhat less toxic than the recently banned neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, but much more toxic than other neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, thiacloprid) still in use in the EU at the time this study was conducted. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,10.1038/s41598-021-86036-1,11,,0,,0.0,,1.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,

Acute dermal toxicity tests by applying thiamethoxam solution (pL) dissolved in acetone on the dorsal side of thoracic region revealed median lethal dose (dermal; 24 h) as 93.97 ng g-1 against A. mellifera where as, for A. c. cerana, it was 86.51 ng g-1 with corresponding log likelihood ratio as 1.40 showing that both the values were at par with each other. In oral toxicity studies, starved honey bee foragers were fed with various concentrations of thiamethoxam in 50% sucrose water solution. Median lethal toxicity values at 24 h against A. mellifera and A. c. cerana were 67.61 and 31.43 ng g-1, respectively. The log likelihood value of 2.78 showed there exists a significant difference among the two values i.e. A. c. cerana was more susceptible (Sensitivity ratio = 2.51) to thiamethoxam than A. mellifera. Values of median lethal toxicity for formulated product of thiamethoxam i.e. Actara® were similar to technical grade (Relative toxicity 1.04 - 1.06), which showed no synergism or potentiation due to formulation, hence laboratory results have field applicability. © 2023 MPH J. ent.

Toxicity of thiametoxam on in vitro reared honey bee brood,828,JOUR,"['Grillone, G.', 'Laurino, D.', 'Manino, A.', 'Porporato, M.']",Apidologie,"Pesticides are a possible cause of pollinator decline and honey bee colony losses experienced in several countries in recent years. In the past years, many north-west Italian beekeepers reported the presence of dead brood in field apiaries during neonicotinoid-coated maize sowing; therefore, a possible role of these insecticides was suspected. The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis. Laboratory repeated dose toxicity tests on in vitro reared larvae were carried out using thiamethoxam. The repeated treatment median lethal concentration (LC50) and the median lethal dose (LD50) 14 and 19 days after grafting were calculated and resulted of the same order of magnitude of realistic brood exposure under a worst-case scenario.

Toxicity to honey bees Apis mellifera adansonii of three insecticides used in cotton cultivation in Benin,913,JOUR,"['Zoclanclounon, D.G.', 'Paraiso, A.A.', 'Boulga, J.', 'Akogbeto, F.', 'Paraiso, G.', 'Yeyi, C.']",Journal of Entomology,"Background and Objective: Protection and preservation of bees are a pledge in a sustainable and environment-friendly agriculture. The economic contribution of the insect’s pollinators to world agriculture is estimated at billions of dollars. However, non-judicious choice of pesticides and absence of good plant protection practices, represent a real danger to bees. The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of three insecticides commonly used in cotton protection on bees Apis mellifera adansonii in Benin. Materials and Methods: In this context, bees were taken from hives and transported to the laboratory. Active ingredients and different doses used were as followed: Emamectin benzoate, beta-cyfluthrin+imidacloprid and lamdex+chlorpyrifos at doses of: 2150 nanograms per bee, 125 nanograms per bee, 75, 50, 25, 12.5×103, 6, 2.5 and 1.25-0.96 ng per bee, depending on the active ingredient. Each treatment included three replications consisting of 25 bees. Bees were anaesthetized with ether before treatment. Each bee received by topical application on the pronotum, 1 μL of the formulation. Results: Observations were made after 2, 10, 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that, even the lowest doses of the pesticides: 0.96, 7.25 and 21.5 ng per b showed mortality higher than 90% to bees, 48 h after application. An insecticide with active ingredients including beta-cyfluthrin (45 g L–1), which is a pyrethroid and Imidacloprid (100 g L–1), a neonicotinoid actually forbidden in many European countries showed very high toxicity to honey bees, indicating values of the LD50 varying from 19.9 ng per bee for 10 h exposure to 1.1×10–2 ng per bee for 18 h and 5×10–4 ng per bee for 36 h. Conclusion: Results of the study indicated the urgent need of good plant protection practices in the frame of sustainable agriculture and bee’s preservation and conservation. Promotion of strategies as part of the dissemination of good agricultural practices in plant protection is a guarantee which should ensure sustainable agriculture and environmental, human and biodiversity protection. These studies showed the urgency of the integrated plant protection in order to promote good agricultural practices for honey bee’s protection. © 2016 Deo Gracias Zoclanclounon et al.",2016,10.3923/je.2016.161.169,13,,0,0.0,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Toxicological Effect and Molecular Mechanism of the Chiral Neonicotinoid Dinotefuran in Honeybees,612,JOUR,"['Zhang, Q.', 'Fu, L.', 'Cang, T.', 'Tang, T.', 'Guo, M.', 'Zhou, B.', 'Zhu, G.', 'Zhao, M.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"With the increasing demand for pollinating services, the wellness of honeybees has received widespread attention. Recent evidence indicated honeybee health might be posed a potential threat by widely used neonicotinoids worldwide. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of these insecticides in honeybees especially at an enantiomeric level. In this study, we selected two species of bees, Apis mellifera (A. mellifera) and Apis cerana (A. cerana), to assess the toxicity and molecular mechanism of neonicotinoid dinotefuran and its enantiomers. The results showed that S-dinotefuran was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran to honeybees by oral and contact exposures as much as 114 times. A. cerana was more susceptible to highly toxic enantiomer S-dinotefuran. S-dinotefuran induced the immune system response in A. cerana after 48 h exposure and significant changes were observed in the neuronal signaling of A. mellifera under three forms of dinotefuran exposure. Moreover, molecular docking also revealed that S-dinotefuran formed more hydrogen bonds than R-dinotefuran with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, indicating the higher toxicity of S-dinotefuran. Data provided here show that R-dinotefuran may be a safer alternative to control pests and protect pollinators than rac-dinotefuran. © 2021 American Chemical Society",2022,10.1021/acs.est.1c05692,56,,0,,0.0,1.0,,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

ML has significant potential in risk assessments of non-target insects for modeling the multiple factors affecting insect health, including the adverse effects of agrochemicals. Here, the potential of ML for risk assessments of glyphosate (herbicide; formulation) and imidacloprid (insecticide, neonicotinoid; formulation) on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata was explored. The collective behavior of forager bees was analyzed after in vitro exposure to agrochemicals. ML algorithms were applied to identify the agrochemicals that the bees have been exposed to based on multivariate behavioral features. Changes in the in situ detection of different proteins in the midgut were also studied. Imidacloprid exposure leads to the greatest changes in behavior. The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology. This study provides a holistic assessment of the sublethal effects of glyphosate and imidacloprid on a key pollinator.

This study evaluated changes in the relative activity of esterases and critical electrolyte concentration in brain cells after exposure to pesticides malathion and thiamethoxam. Lethal concentration 50% showed greater toxicity of thiamethoxam in relation to malathion. Esterases EST-3 and EST-4 (carboxylesterase) were partially inhibited after contamination by contact and ingestion of malathion and contamination by contact with thiamethoxam, suggesting participation of these esterases in the metabolization of these compounds. The lowest critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) was found after contamination by malathion ingestion (0.15 M), indicating changes in gene expression. The alterations observed in the intensity of EST-3 and EST-4 and the chromatin structure indicate that pesticides can act in gene expression and be used as biomarkers of contaminant residues.

Toxicological status changes the susceptibility of the honey bee Apis mellifera to a single fungicidal spray application,641,JOUR,"['Almasri, H.', 'Tavares, D.A.', 'Tchamitchian, S.', 'Pélissier, M.', 'Sené, D.', 'Cousin, M.', 'Brunet, J.-L.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"During all their life stages, bees are exposed to residual concentrations of pesticides, such as insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, stored in beehive matrices. Fungicides are authorized for use during crop blooms because of their low acute toxicity to honey bees. Thus, a bee that might have been previously exposed to pesticides through contaminated food may be subjected to fungicide spraying when it initiates its first flight outside the hive. In this study, we assessed the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide in bees with different toxicological statuses. Three days after emergence, bees were subjected to chronic exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid and the herbicide glyphosate, either individually or in a binary mixture, at environmental concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 μg/L in food (0.0083 and 0.083 μg/kg) for 30 days. Seven days after the beginning of chronic exposure to the pesticides (10 days after emergence), the bees were subjected to spraying with the fungicide difenoconazole at the registered field dosage. The results showed a delayed significant decrease in survival when honey bees were treated with the fungicide. Fungicide toxicity increased when honey bees were chronically exposed to glyphosate at the lowest concentration, decreased when they were exposed to imidacloprid, and did not significantly change when they were exposed to the binary mixture regardless of the concentration. Bees exposed to all of these pesticide combinations showed physiological disruptions, revealed by the modulation of several life history traits related mainly to metabolism, even when no effect of the other pesticides on fungicide toxicity was observed. These results show that the toxicity of active substances may be misestimated in the pesticide registration procedure, especially for fungicides. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021,10.1007/s11356-021-13747-3,28,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,
Traces of a neonicotinoid induce precocious foraging and reduce foraging performance in honey bees,738,JOUR,"['Colin, T.', 'Meikle, W.G.', 'Wu, X.', 'Barron, A.B.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"There is increasing worldwide concern about the impacts of pesticide residues on honey bees and bee colony survival, but how sublethal effects of pesticides on bees might cause colony failure remains highly controversial, with field data giving very mixed results. To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 μg/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",2019,10.1021/acs.est.9b02452,53,,0,,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,
"Traces of a neonicotinoid pesticide stimulate different honey bee colony activities, but do not increase colony size or longevity",582,JOUR,"['Meikle, W.G.', 'Colin, T.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.', 'Weiss, M.', 'Barron, A.B.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"How neonicotinoid contamination affects honey bees remains controversial. Studies have yielded contradictory results, and few have examined effects on colony development. Here we report the results of a comprehensive five-year study of the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honey bee colonies. Colonies fed 5 ng/g (ppb) imidacloprid in sugar syrup showed increased brood production, lower temperature variability, higher CO2 production and had more foragers compared to control colonies fed unadulterated syrup, but treatment did not affect adult bee numbers or average hive temperatures, and did not increase food stores, daily food acquisition or colony survivorship. These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids. Effect sizes were generally small but that could be attributed at least in part to variability in uncontrolled factors such as weather. We provide an explanation for the diverse effects of pesticide contamination on honey bees, and an improved understanding of how colonies are impacted. © 2022",2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113202,231,,0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,

Among them, Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides might act in combination and lead to a higher honeybee mortality. We investigated the molecular response of honeybees exposed to N. ceranae, to insecticides (fipronil or imidacloprid), and to a combination of both stressors. Midgut transcriptional changes induced by these stressors were measured in two independent experiments combining a global RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach with the screening of the expression of selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Although N. ceranae-insecticide combinations induced a significant increase in honeybee mortality, we observed that they did not lead to a synergistic effect. According to gene expression profiles, chronic exposure to insecticides had no significant impact on detoxifying genes but repressed the expression of immunity-related genes. Honeybees treated with N. ceranae , alone or in combination with an insecticide, showed a strong alteration of midgut immunity together with modifications affecting cuticle coatings and trehalose metabolism. An increasing impact of treatments on gene expression profiles with time was identified suggesting an absence of stress recovery which could be linked to the higher mortality rates observed. © 2014 Aufauvre et al.",2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091686,9,,0,1.0,,,0.0,,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

Pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. However, knowledge of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide in beekeeping practice, influencing on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development is lacking. Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group.

Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),337,JOUR,"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/food–oral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not host–pathogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey bees’ innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,,,,,
Transcriptomic analysis of Malpighian tubules from the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris reveals thiamethoxam-induced damages,516,JOUR,"['Miotelo, L.', 'Ferro, M.', 'Maloni, G.', 'Otero, I.V.R.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.', 'Bacci, M.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The concern about pesticide exposure to neotropical bees has been increasing in the last few years, and knowledge gaps have been identified. Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./μL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level. Therefore, interference of different cellular processes directly affects the health of M. scutellaris by compromising the function of Mt. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158086,850,,0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,0.0,1.0,,,1.0,0.0,,,,

We measured hemolymph protein levels and the lifespan of honey bees fed on diets containing non-hybrid (IAC-Airan), hybrid (AG 7088) or transgenic (AG 8088YG) maize, the seeds of which had been treated with fipronil, imidacloprid or left untreated. Corn from these plantings was harvested, dried and finely ground, and then used for the preparation of corn-based diets. Groups of 100 newly emerged bees were placed in cages, where the diets were offered ad libitum. Honey bee lifespan was similar for all the corn diets, though shorter than for bees fed beebread and longer than for bees fed only honey. Total protein in the hemolymph of bees fed with transgenic maize was 15% lower than in bees fed on non-hybrid maize; lipophorin and vitellogenin, were more reduced, by over 30%. Irrespective of corn variety, imidacloprid resulted in over 25% lower levels of lipophorin compared with the control.

Such new, anthropogenic stressors include the neonicotinoid class of crop-protecting agents, which have been implicated in the population declines of pollinating insects, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 mu g/L-1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program. The multifaceted, physiological response described here may be of importance to our general understanding of pollinator health. Muscles, for instance, work at high glycolytic rates and flight performance could be impacted should low levels of this evolutionarily novel stressor likewise induce downregulation of energy metabolising genes in adult pollinators.",2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0068191,8,,0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,

In addition, the changes of clothianidin residue in the guttation fluid of maize plants in Turkey were determined in 2018 and 2019. Also, the toxicity of guttation fluid collected from the maize plants to bees was determined in ecotoxicological tests. The acute oral LD50 of clothianidin to honey bees in the first 24 h was 1.80 ng bee-1 and residue analysis demonstrated that honey bees were exposed to clothianidin concentration in guttation fluid ranging from 0.02 to 6.0 mg L-1 with mortality ranging between 80 and 100%. As the measured concentration of clothianidin in guttation fluid can lead to the mortality of honey bees, present study indicates that clothianidin, and possibly related pesticides in treated maize seed poses a risk to honey bees.

USE OF PRIMARY CULTURES OF KENYON CELLS FROM BUMBLEBEE BRAINS TO ASSESS PESTICIDE SIDE EFFECTS,336,JOUR,"['Wilson, DE', 'Velarde, RA', 'Fahrbach, SE', 'Mommaerts, V', 'Smagghe, G']",ARCHIVES OF INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,"Bumblebees are important pollinators in natural and agricultural ecosystems. The latter results in the frequent exposure of bumblebees to pesticides. We report here on a new bioassay that uses primary cultures of neurons derived from adult bumblebee workers to evaluate possible side-effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid. Mushroom bodies (MBs) from the brains of bumblebee workers were dissected and dissociated to produce cultures of Kenyon cells (KCs). Cultured KCs typically extend branched, dendrite-like processes called neurites, with substantial growth evident 24-48 h after culture initiation. Exposure of cultured KCs obtained from newly eclosed adult workers to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) imidacloprid, an environmentally relevant concentration of pesticide, did not have a detectable effect on neurite outgrowth. By contrast, in cultures prepared from newly eclosed adult bumblebees, inhibitory effects of imidacloprid were evident when the medium contained 25 ppb imidacloprid, and no growth was observed at 2,500 ppb. The KCs of older workers (13-day-old nurses and foragers) appeared to be more sensitive to imidacloprid than newly eclosed adults, as strong effects on KCs obtained from older nurses and foragers were also evident at 2.5 ppb imidacloprid. In conclusion, primary cultures using KCs of bumblebee worker brains offer a tool to assess sublethal effects of neurotoxic pesticides in vitro.

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding. This research sheds light on pesticides′ probable inhibitory effects on SDH, a vital enzyme in honey bee energy production and mitochondrial function. The findings highlight the importance of stringent pesticide controls and long-term pest management measures to protect pollinator numbers and ecosystem health. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",2024,10.1002/slct.202305067,9,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,,,,,

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2–5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health. N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid insecticides are much less toxic to honeybees and bumble bees than N-nitroguanidine compounds. Manjon et al. show that this results from differences in their efficiency of metabolism by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, demonstrating their role as key determinants of bee sensitivity to this insecticide class. © 2018 The Author(s)",2018,10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.045,28,,0,,0.0,1.0,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,
Use of double-stranded RNA targeting β2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit to control pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum at larval and adult stages,222,JOUR,"['Ligonniere, S', 'Raymond, V', 'Goven, D']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of the RNA interference technology (RNAi) has emerged as one of the new strategies for species-specific control of insect pests. Its specificity depends on the distinctiveness of the target gene sequence for a given species. In this work, we assessed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (A. pisum) the use of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets the beta 2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (dsRNA-beta 2), which shares low sequence identity with other subunits, to control populations of this pest at different developmental stages. Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Using a toxicoproteomic approach to investigate the effects of thiamethoxam into the brain of Apis mellifera,700,JOUR,"['Roat, T.C.', 'Santos-Pinto, J.R.A.D.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'de Souza, C.L.', 'Palma, M.S.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Chemosphere,"Neonicotinoids have been described as toxic to bees. In this context, the A. mellifera foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100: 0,0227 ng de thiamethoxam/μL−1 diet), a neurotoxic insecticide, for 8 days; and it was decided to investigate the insecticide effect on the brain by a shotgun proteomic approach followed by label-free quantitative-based proteomics. A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism. Our scientific outcomes demonstrated that a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam can impair biological processes and important metabolic pathways, causing damage to the nervous system of bees, and in the long term, can compromise the nutrition and physiology of individuals from the colony. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127362,258,,0,0.0,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.0,,,,
Using the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,515,JOUR,"['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

Using video-tracking to assess sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),980,JOUR,"['Teeters, B.S.', 'Johnson, R.M.', 'Ellis, M.D.', 'Siegfried, B.D.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Concern about the role of pesticides in honey bee decline has highlighted the need to examine the effects of sublethal exposure on bee behaviors. The video-tracking system EthoVisionXT (Noldus Information Technologies) was used to measure the effects of sublethal exposure to tau-fluvalinate and imidacloprid on honey bee locomotion, interactions, and time spent near a food source over a 24-h observation period. Bees were either treated topically with 0.3, 1.5, and 3μg tau-fluvalinate or exposed to 0.05, 0.5, 5.0, 50, and 500 ppb imidacloprid in a sugar agar cube. Tau-fluvalinate caused a significant reduction in distance moved at all dose levels (p<0.05), as did 50 and 500 ppb imidacloprid (p<0.001). Bees exposed to 50 and 500 ppb spent significantly more time near the food source than control bees (p<0.05). Interaction time decreased as time in the food zone increased for both chemicals. This study documents that video-tracking of bee behavior can enhance current protocols for measuring the effects of pesticides on honey bees at sublethal levels. It may provide a means of identifying problematic compounds for further testing. © 2012 SETAC.",2012,10.1002/etc.1830,31,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,
"Validation of quantitative real-time PCR reference genes and spatial expression profiles of detoxication-related genes under pesticide induction in honey bee, Apis mellifera",527,JOUR,"['Kim, Y.', 'Kim, H.', 'Cha, J.', 'Lee, S.H.', 'Kim, Y.H.']",PLoS ONE,"Recently, pesticides have been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the large-scale decline in honey bee populations, including colony collapse disorder. The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. © 2022 Kim et al.

However, recent researcprovides evidence of the negative effects of this and its possible influence on the deterioration of the health of pollinators. Durinthe experiment, mixed-age worker bees of A. mellifera were exposed to a single, sublethal oral dose of flupyradifurone (645 ngbee) and were assessed only for the first day after exposure to 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours. Using reverse transcriptase polymeraschain reaction (RT-qPCR), the alteration in gene expression caused by exposure to this insecticide was quantified. A total of fiv genes were quantified: three primary antioxidant genes (Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and Thioredoxin dismutase (Trxr1), one detoxification gene (Cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3)) and one gene with neuronal activity (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE1). The endogenous ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) gene allowed the estimation of relative gene expression as the response to insecticide exposure. The AChE1 gene was overexpressed up to six hours after exposure; the remaining CYP9Q3, CAT, SOD1, and Trxr1 genes presented a similar behavior. At a sublethal dose and at short time intervals, flupyradifurone causes alteration in the relative expression of five genes in individual honeybees after oral exposure, which could cause a long-term adverse effect on hive health. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Various routes of formulated insecticide mixture whole-body acute contact toxicity to honey bees (Apis mellifera),596,JOUR,"['Belsky, J.', 'Biddinger, D.J.', 'Seiter, N.', 'Joshi, N.K.']",Environmental Challenges,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) are crucial pollinators, however large overwinter losses of managed hives and declines in feral colonies have occurred since 2006. Increased insecticide use and the introduction of new insecticide classes have been proposed as factors contributing to these declines. Previous studies have demonstrated contact toxicity of single active ingredient insecticides to honey bees. However, the field realistic contact toxicity of formulated (pre-mix) insecticide mixtures containing multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to honey bees has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we simulate whole body contact to spray applications made at low label recommended field rates of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram to honey bees under three realistic scenarios in field crops: (1) continuous exposure, (2) spray-only exposure, and (3) residual exposure. A customized spray tower in a laboratory setting was used to apply insecticides at the lowest recommended dose in the Environmental Protection Agency regulated label of each insecticide. Acute toxicity was determined by screening resulting mortality up to 96-hours post treatment. Mortality varied significantly between treatments at all evaluation periods for all experiments except residual exposure. For continuous and spray-only exposure, thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin resulted in 80–90% mortality at 48-hours, while at 96-hours we observed close to complete mortality for all treatments. This difference in mortality onset between treatments highlights the importance of extended observation beyond the 48-hours recommended by the USDA-EPA. Our finding of overall high mortality demonstrates the importance of comparing both combined and individual active ingredients in determining insecticide risk to honey bees. © 2021 The Author(s)",2022,10.1016/j.envc.2021.100408,6,,0,0.0,,,,1.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,

Whole-body acute contact toxicity of formulated insecticide mixtures to blue orchard bees (Osmia lignaria),655,JOUR,"['Belsky, J.', 'Biddinger, D.J.', 'Joshi, N.K.']",Toxics,"Blue orchard bees, [Osmia lignaria (Say) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)], have been developed as an important pollinator for orchard crops in North America over the last 40 years. The toxicity of several pesticides to O. lignaria and other Osmia species has been previously reported. However, the field-realistic toxicity of formulated premix insecticides comprised of multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to O. lignaria has not been assessed. Here, we use a customized spray tower in a laboratory setting to assess adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to four formulated pesticide mixtures: thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin (TLC), imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin (IBC), chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (CLC) and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram (MS) by directly spraying anesthetized bees in Petri dishes. Sepa-rately, adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to formulated imidacloprid (I), beta-cyfluthrin (BC) and their 1:1 binary combination (IBC) was assessed using the same experimental method. Resulting mortality in each study was screened up to 96 h post-treatment to determine acute whole-body contact toxicity. In the first study, TLC and IBC resulted in statistically higher mortality at 24 and 48 h than the two other insecticide combinations tested. The CLC and MS combinations were slower acting and the highest mortality for O. lignaria exposed to these mixtures was recorded at 96 h. We did observe significant differences in toxicity between CLC and MS. In the second study, exposure to the 1:1 binary combination of IBC caused overall significantly higher mortality than exposure to I or BC alone. Both active ingredients alone, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of mortality to the 1:1 binary combination treatment at the 96 h observation reading, indicating increased speed of kill, but not necessarily increased toxicity. Significant differences in the onset of mortality following acute contact whole-body exposure to the formulated insecticide mixtures and individual active ingredients tested were consistently observed across all experiments in both studies. © 2021 by the authors.

Wings as a new route of exposure to pesticides in the honey bee,914,JOUR,"['Poquet, Y.', 'Kairo, G.', 'Tchamitchian, S.', 'Brunet, J.-L.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"In pesticide risk assessment, estimating the routes and levels of exposure is critical. For honey bees subjected to pesticide spray, toxicity is assessed by thorax contact to account for all possible contact exposures. In the present study, the authors tested 6 active substances with different hydrophobicity. For the first time, the authors demonstrated that it is possible to induce mortality by pesticide contact with only the wings of the honey bee. The toxicities induced by contact with the wings and thorax were similar, with the wing median lethal dose (LD50) being 0.99 to 2.23 times higher than that of the thorax. This finding demonstrates that the wings represent a relevant route of exposure in the honey bee. In a second approach, the authors estimated the air volume displaced by the wings during 1 beating cycle to be 0.51±0.03cm3, which corresponds to a volume of 116.8±5.8cm3s-1 at a wing beat frequency of 230 Hz. The authors then tested realistic scenarios of exposure for bees flying through a pesticide cloud at different concentrations. In the worst-case scenario, the dose accumulated during the flight reached 525ngbee-1s-1. These results show that the procedure used to assess the risk posed by contact with pesticides could be improved by accounting for wing exposure. © 2015 SETAC.",2015,10.1002/etc.3014,34,,0,0.0,,1.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,

The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 µg/ml to 5 and 1 µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. © 2019 E.

Within-Body Distributions and Feeding Effects of the Neonicotinoid Insecticide Clothianidin in Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),234,JOUR,"['Aarones, MR', 'Paus-Knudsen, JS', 'Nielsen, A', 'Rundberget, JT', 'Borgå, K']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Bumblebees can be exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides through nectar and pollen collected from treated crops, which can cause lethal and sublethal effects in these nontarget pollinators. However, the body distribution of the compound after exposure to neonicotinoids in bumblebees is not well studied. Bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris, n = 20) were exposed to field-realistic concentrations of clothianidin through artificial nectar (3.6-13 mu g/L) for 9 d. Comparison of the nominal with the measured exposure in nectar indicated good compliance, confirming the applicability of the method. When quantified, clothianidin showed a concentration-dependent occurrence in the head and body of workers (head: <0.2-2.17 mu g/kg; body: <0.2-3.17 mu g/kg), and in the body of queens (<0.2-2.49 mu g/kg), although concentrations were below those measured in the nectar (bioaccumulation factor = 0.2). Exposure to clothianidin did not affect mortality nor brood production, nor did it have a statistically significant effect on nectar consumption and size of food storage. However, visual inspection suggests higher nectar consumption of nectar with low clothianidin content compared with nectar with no or high clothianidin content. Our results show that dietary clothianidin is taken up in bumblebees, but does not bioaccumulate to elevated levels compared with exposure. Still, clothianidin may elicit responses that affect feeding behavior of the pollinator B. terrestris, although our endpoints were not significantly affected. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-10.

For this purpose two different rates of abraded seed dust, containing active substance Clothianidin, were applied on flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham during bee-flight with a purpose-built dust applicator. We observed dose-related high acute effects on bee mortality at both application rates, 0.25 and 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin in dust per ha, resulting in up to 4.3 and 17 fold higher mortality compared to pre-application level and an overall increase of mortality during the 7 days exposure period of 2.0 and 9.8 fold. In dead bees, residues detected between both rates appliedwere up to 2.6 fold higher in the 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin dust exposure scenario. On day 7, residues up to 28 μg Clothianidin/kg were detected in bee bread of stored Phacelia pollen. The findings of high effects at chosen rates highlight the need to include specific dust drift field trials for seed treatment products with highly toxic insecticides in risk assessment used in crops with potential dust abrasion and emission from seeds. Further work is required to determine appropriate application rates in further semi-field and field testing that reflect field realistic drift exposure levels. © 2015, Universita degli Studi di Bologna, Department of Agroenvironmental Sciences and Technologies.

Effects of the Neonicotinoid Imidacloprid on the Feeding Behavior of Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides Lep.,44,JOUR,"['Costa, LGD', 'Barchuk, AR', 'Teixeira, IRD']",REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL,"Even though meliponines are among the greatest pollinating agents in Neotropical ecosystems, the populations of these bees are in decline due to anthropic actions, such as the indiscriminate use of pesticides. Neonicotinoids, such as Imidacloprid, are used in many crops and have been shown to be one of the pesticides groups with the most damaging effects on the health of bee colonies. The goals of this work were (1) to evaluate the ability of Melipona quadrifasciata, a native Brazilian stingless bee species, to detect the presence of Imidacloprid in artificial diets, and (2) to evaluate how this insecticide may affect their behavior. For this purpose, behavioral experiments were carried out in observation arenas where artificial flowers containing different concentrations of Imidacloprid (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) were made available to forager bees and their choice and behavior were registered. Our results showed that bee choices were not affected by the different concentrations of Imidacloprid, even at extremely high doses in the flowers (20%). It was also found that the presence of this insecticide interfered with the communication between individuals as a result of reduced antennation events. Both findings, the apparent inability of bees to detect the presence of the insecticide and the change in behavior caused by the exposition to the volatilized product, may rapidly lead to colony losses in nature.",2020,10.18406/2316-1817v12n120201411,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,,1.0,2.0

Sunflower seed are treated with 0.7 mg a.i./grain which is equivalent to 50 a.i./ha at a planting density of 70,000 plants/ha. In 3 tunnel and 8 field tests it was examined whether this seeddressing could have an influence on honeybees at the time of flowering. Residue analysis of flowers and honeybees were performed to determine the exposure of these pollinating insects during flowering. The residue levels were then compared with effect concentrations as determined in controlled feeding experiments. In none of the 3 tunnel and 8 field tests did the seeddressing with imidacloprid affect the vitality, the foraging activity or the behaviour of the honeybees. From these results it can be reliably concluded that a seeddressing of sunflower seed with imidacloprid has no biological relevance for honeybees. Pollen and nectar of sunflower plants were analysed for the presence of imidacloprid and its relevant metabolites. No quantifiable residue levels were found at a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb. In the controlled feeding experiments under field conditions, no adverse effects were observed on bees fed with spiked sugar solution up to 20 ppb imidacloprid. At higher concentrations (50-100 ppb) honeybees only reduced transitorily the foraging activity which indicates that honeybees realise the presence of imidacloprid at these levels. When these results are compared with the residue levels found in the relevant parts of the, sunflower plants it is evident that the findings of the tunnel and field tests are fully confirmed and that no adverse effects on honeybees must be expected from the use of Gauch (R) in sunflowers.",2001,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,1.0,4.0

In greenhouse, workers visited blooming heads of treated and control plants at the same rate and the mean duration of their visits was similar.

Two doses were used: D1=10 mu g PLL kg-l in syrup and 6 mu g AI kg(-1) in pollen; D2 was 2.5 times higher in syrup and 2.7 higher in pollen. During 85 days 27, 30 and 29 micro-colonies were reared for control, D1 and D2 treatments respectively. Food consumption was not affected by either dose. During the 5-day pre-oviposition period the mean insecticide intake was 4.8 ng per day per worker in treatment D2. Both doses slightly but significantly affected worker survival rate by 10% during the first month, without any dose-effect relationship. Brood production was significantly reduced in D1 treatment and larval ejection by workers was significantly lower in D1 and D2 than in control. No significant effect of D1 and D2 treatments on the duration of larval development was revealed. No residue could be detected in workers still alive after 85 days. It was concluded that the survival rate and reproductive capacity of B terrestris was not likely to be affected by prolonged ingestion of nectar produced by sunflower after seed-dressing treatment with imidacloprid (Gaucho), since honey or pollen collected by honeybees foraging treated sunflower never revealed concentrations of imidacloprid higher than 10 mu g kg(-1).

Clearance of ingested neonicotinoid pesticide (imidacloprid) in honey bees (Apis mellifera) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),19,JOUR,"['Cresswell, J.E.', 'Robert, F.-X.L.', 'Florance, H.', 'Smirnoff, N.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Bees in agricultural landscapes are exposed to dietary pesticides such as imidacloprid when they feed from treated mass-flowering crops. Concern about the consequent impact on bees makes it important to understand their resilience. In the laboratory, the authors therefore fed adult worker bees on dosed syrup (125 μg L-1 of imidacloprid, or 98 μg kg-1) either continuously or as a pulsed exposure and measured their behaviour (feeding and locomotory activity) and whole-body residues. RESULTS: On dosed syrup, honey bees maintained much lower bodily levels of imidacloprid than bumblebees (<0.2 ng versus 2.4 ng of imidacloprid per bee). Dietary imidacloprid did not affect the behaviour of honey bees, but it reduced feeding and locomotory activity in bumblebees. After the pulsed exposure, bumblebees cleared bodily imidacloprid after 48 h and recovered behaviourally. CONCLUSION: The differential behavioural resilience of the two species can be attributed to the observed differential in bodily residues. The ability of bumblebees to recover may be environmentally relevant in wild populations that face transitory exposures from the pulsed blooming of mass-flowering crops. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.",2014,10.1002/ps.3569,70,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,7.0

Bees treated with TMX demonstrated a significantly lower number of flower visits per minute compared with the control group. Although we did not observe a significant difference in yield parameters between TMX treatments and the control group, a positive correlation was observed between yield and the bees’ flower visitation rate.

Interaction between Varroa destructor and imidacloprid reduces flight capacity of honeybees,78,JOUR,"['Blanken, L.J.', 'van Langevelde, F.', 'van Dooremalen, C.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Current high losses of honeybees seriously threaten crop pollination. Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Chronic oral toxicity protocol for adult solitary bees (Osmia bicornis L.): Reduced survival under long-term exposure to a “bee-safe” insecticide,18,JOUR,"Azpiazu, C.; Sgolastra, F.; Ippolito, A.; Albacete, S.; Brandt, A.; Colli, M.; Grossar, D.; Jeker, L.; Malagnini, V.; Sancho, G.; Splitt, A.; Straub, L.; Strobl, V.; Boranski, M.; Jachuła, J.; Martins, C.; Medrzycki, P.; Simon-Delso, N.; Tosi, S.; Bosch, J.",Environmental Pollution,"Pollinators are essential for crop productivity. Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ≤ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ≤10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors",2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,1.0,11.0

Flight muscles are a crucial source of physiological heat as well as being vital for behavioural heat regulation, and are negatively affected by neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, we evaluated the flight efficiency and capacity of Apis mellifera scutellata under the influence of both elevated ambient temperatures and sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The various aspects of flight; success, distance, speed, and duration, were not notably affected by these factors. However, the honey bees’ ability to initiate a successful flight was significantly affected by neonicotinoid exposure. Such a reduction in honey bee flight capacity, and flight muscle function in general, especially under the increasing frequency and intensity of hot weather events, is cause for concern when considering legislation and use of these neonicotinoids in the agricultural and suburban setting. © 2024 The Author(s).

"Combined nutritional stress and a new systemic pesticide (flupyradifurone, Sivanto®) reduce bee survival, food consumption, flight success, and thermoregulation",20,JOUR,"['Tong, L.', 'Nieh, J.C.', 'Tosi, S.']",Chemosphere,"Flupyradifurone (FPF, Sivanto®) is a new butenolide insecticide that, like the neonicotinoids, is a systemic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. However, FPF is considered bee-safe (according to standard Risk Assessment tests), and is thus a potential solution to the adverse effects of other pesticides on beneficial insects. To date, no studies have examined the impact of nutritional stress (decreased food diversity and quality) and FPF exposure on bee health although both stressors can occur, especially around agricultural monocultures. We therefore tested the effects of a field-realistic FPF concentration (4 ppm, FPFdaily dose = 241 ± 4 ng/bee/day, 1/12 of LD50) and nutritional stress (nectar with low-sugar concentrations) on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mortality, food consumption, thermoregulation, flight success (unsuccessful vs. successful), and flight ability (duration, distance, velocity). Flight and thermoregulation are critical to colony health: bees fly to collect food and reproduce, and they thermoregulate to increase flight efficiency and to rear brood. We studied the effects across seasons because seasonality can influence bee sensitivity to environmental stress. We demonstrate that, depending upon season and nutritional stress, FPF can reduce bee survival (−14%), food consumption (−14%), thermoregulation (−4%, i.e. hypothermia), flight success (−19%), and increase flight velocity (+13%). Because pesticide exposure and nutritional stress can co-occur, we suggest that future studies and pesticide risk assessments consider both seasonality and nutritional stress when evaluating pesticide safety for bees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124408,237,,0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1.0,13.0
The effect of dietary neonicotinoid pesticides on non-flight thermogenesis in worker bumble bees (Bombus terrestris),162,JOUR,"['Potts, R.', 'Clarke, R.M.', 'Oldfield, S.E.', 'Wood, L.K.', 'Hempel de Ibarra, N.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"For bumble bees (genus Bombus), the capacity for non-flight thermogenesis is essential for two fundamental processes undertaken by adult workers, namely recovery from torpor after chilling and brood incubation. Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose–response relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,14.0

The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifur-one (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF.

Field rates of Sivanto™ (flupyradifurone) and Transform® (sulfoxaflor) increase oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),59,JOUR,"['Chakrabarti, P.', 'Carlson, E.A.', 'Lucas, H.M.', 'Melathopoulos, A.P.', 'Sagili, R.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Pesticide exposures can have detrimental impacts on bee pollinators, ranging from immediate mortality to sub-lethal impacts. Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto™ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform®. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted—a shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto™ and Transform®, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto™ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform® exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto™ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto™, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. © 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

"Exposure to an insecticide formulation alters chemosensory orientation, but not floral scent detection, in buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)",53,JOUR,"['Kárpáti, Z', 'Szelényi, MO', 'Tóth, Z']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Although pesticide-free techniques have been developed in agriculture, pesticides are still routinely used against weeds, pests, and pathogens worldwide. These agrochemicals pollute the environment and can negatively impact human health, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Acetamiprid, an approved neonicotinoid pesticide in the EU, may exert sub-lethal effects on pollinators and other organisms. However, our knowledge on the scope and severity of such effects is still incomplete. Our experiments focused on the effects of the insecticide formulation Mospilan (active ingredient: 20% acetamiprid) on the peripheral olfactory detection of a synthetic floral blend and foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers. We found that the applied treatment did not affect the antennal detection of the floral blend; however, it induced alterations in their foraging behaviour. Pesticide-treated individuals started foraging later, and the probability of finding the floral blend was lower than that of the control bumblebees. However, exposed bumblebees found the scent source faster than the controls. These results suggest that acetamiprid-containing Mospilan may disrupt the activity and orientation of foraging bumblebees. We hypothesize that the observed effects of pesticide exposure on foraging behaviour could be mediated through neurophysiological and endocrine mechanisms. We propose that future investigations should clarify whether such sub-lethal effects can affect pollinators' population dynamics and their ecosystem services.",2024,10.1038/s41598-024-65388-4,14,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,17.0
A New Approach for Detecting Sublethal Effects of Neonicotinoids on Bumblebees Using Optical Sensor Technology,0,JOUR,"['Chatzaki, V', 'Montoro, M', 'El-Rashid, R', 'Jensen, AB', 'Lecocq, A']",INSECTS,"Among insects, bees are important pollinators, providing many vital ecosystem services. The recent pollinator decline is threatening both their diversity and abundance. One of the main drivers of this decline is the extensive use of pesticides. Neonicotinoids, one of the most popular groups of pesticides, can be toxic to bees. In fact, numerous studies have found that neonicotinoids can cause sublethal effects, which can impair the biology, physiology, and colony survival of the bees. Yet, there are still knowledge gaps, and more research is needed to better understand the interaction between neonicotinoids and bees, especially in the field. A new optical sensor, which can automatically identify flying insects using machine learning, has been created to continuously monitor insect activity in the field. This study investigated the potential use of this sensor as a tool for monitoring the sublethal effects of pesticides on bumblebees. Bombus terrestris workers were orally exposed to field-realistic doses of imidacloprid. Two types of exposures were tested: acute and chronic. The flight activity of pesticide-exposed and non-exposed bumblebees was recorded, and the events of the insect flights recorded by the sensor were used in two ways: to extract the values of the wingbeat frequency and to train machine learning models. The results showed that the trained model was able to recognize differences between the events created by pesticide-exposed bumblebees and the control bumblebees. This study demonstrates the possibility of the optical sensor for use as a tool to monitor bees that have been exposed to sublethal doses of pesticides. The optical sensor can provide data that could be helpful in managing and, ideally, mitigating the decline of pollinators from one of their most major threats, pesticides.",2023,10.3390/insects14080713,14,,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,1.0,18.0
The novel pesticide flupyradifurone (Sivanto) affects honeybee motor abilities,171,JOUR,"['Hesselbach, H', 'Scheiner, R']",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Honeybees and other pollinators are threatened by changing landscapes and pesticides resulting from intensified agriculture. In 2018 the European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the name of Sivanto was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless, flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone (830 mu mol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2 mu g/bee). These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0-1.75 mu g) continuously over 24h with food the observed effects are slighter. For comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this pesticide (4ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02028-y,28,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,19.0
Chronic exposure to a field-realistic concentration of Closer® SC (24% sulfoxaflor) insecticide impacted the growth and foraging activity of honey bee colonies,17,JOUR,"['El-Din, H.S.', 'Helmy, W.S.', 'Al Naggar, Y.', 'Ahmed, F.S.']",Apidologie,"The effects of sulfoxaflor on various pollinators have long been debated. However, there have been few in-hive studies on sulfoximines, and the effects on honey bee colony growth and foraging activity are unknown. Here, we calculated the LC50 of Closer® 24% suspension concentrate (SC) using honey bee foragers then assessed the impacts of chronic exposure of honey bees to a lesser concentration of Closer® in a semi-field in-hive experiment. To do that, we used a worst-case exposure scenario and fed bees for 21 days with a sublethal and field-relevant concentration of sulfoxaflor (0.3 ppb) which represents the calculated LC5 value of Closer®. A total of six colonies was assigned to the pesticide or control treatment. Then, we evaluated the colony development and activity as well as the weight and foraging activity of individual foraging bees. We also revealed that sublethal Closer® exposure impacted honey bee colony growth and activity by reducing bee bread, honey, and brood production, as well as weight and foraging performance of individual bees when colonies were kept under field conditions. Given the findings of this study, as well as comparable findings reported on spray application of Closer® using standard application practices in semi-field conditions, sulfoxaflor’s potential harm to pollinators at realistic levels merits additional investigation particularly in combination with other stressors to better understand how novel insecticides influence pollinators and pollination services. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00937-2,53,,0,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1.0,20.0
Effects of the novel pesticide flupyradifurone (Sivanto) on honeybee taste and cognition,45,JOUR,"['Hesselbach, H.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Scientific Reports,"Due to intensive agriculture honeybees are threatened by various pesticides. The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain. Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of ""Sivanto"" against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects. Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors studied here. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018,10.1038/s41598-018-23200-0,8,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,21.0
"Time-dependent effects on bumble bees of dietary exposures to farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil)",176,JOUR,"['Mulvey, J.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Farmland bees encounter insecticides in their diet when visiting the flowers of pesticide-treated crops with residues in nectar and pollen. A sustained exposure to even trace residues could be severely harmful if the ingested substance has a long biological half-life and its toxicity therefore intensifies over time, which is termed time-reinforced toxicity (TRT). Bumble bees are important farmland pollinators, but their susceptibility to TRT from insecticides has not been established previously. This study therefore investigated the potential for three farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil) to generate TRT in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) by dietary exposure in the laboratory using lethality as an endpoint under both fixed-dose and pulsed-dose regimes. RESULTS: The insecticides varied in toxic effect. Fipronil exposures produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity (days of exposure survived) and strong TRT with no evidence of clearance-based recovery. Thiamethoxam exposures also produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity, but with moderate TRT and evidence of some clearance-based recovery. Imidacloprid exposures produced a hormesis with reduced longevity only at the highest doses and an absence of TRT. CONCLUSION: Our study further confirms the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. Our findings suggest that regulatory oversight of pesticides will better safeguard bee health by testing the active ingredients of farmland agrochemicals for their capacity to produce TRT in these ecologically important nontarget organisms. Our study demonstrates the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bumble bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",2020,10.1002/ps.5838,76,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,22.0
Supplemental carbohydrates influence abiotic stress resistance in honey bees,154,JOUR,"['Mogren, C.L.', 'Margotta, J.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"During periods of pollen and nectar dearth, beekeepers may provide supplemental foods in the form of sucrose (SS), high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), or artificial pollen. However, these lack micronutrients present in nectar and honey, and thus may nutritionally stress colonies. Given the many stressors faced by honey bees in the environment, we evaluated how honey bees fed supplemental carbohydrates responded in combination with heat (45 °C), cold (4 °C), or imidacloprid (0.48 ng/ml) exposure. Bees were fed either honey, SS, HFCS, or HFCS + pollen and then exposed to abiotic stress treatments in the lab. Hive bee mortality was not affected by heat or cold stress, but mortality was greater for bees fed SS in imidacloprid treatments. Levels of stress proteins (superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein (HSP70), and potentially esterase) were quantified to determine sublethal stress. SOD levels were reduced in SS and HFCS treatments, indicating these diets impaired a response to oxidative stress, particularly at 45 °C. HSP70 levels were higher in the imidacloprid treatment, with no differences between control and temperature treatments. Diet interacted significantly with stress treatment with generally negative responses to HFCS. There was no effect of diet on esterase levels, though activity was much lower at 4 °C. In semifield trials, colonies with newly emerged bees fed SS experienced higher rates of worker mortality. In cage and field trials, bees consumed significantly more honey and HFCS + P than SS and HFCS. Together, these results suggest that supplemental carbohydrates contribute to sublethal stress, and natural food sources are preferred. © 2018, © 2018 International Bee Research Association.",2018,10.1080/00218839.2018.1494912,57,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,23.0
Sugar content of diet does not buffer against chronic oral imidacloprid exposure in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),153,JOUR,"['Cecala, J.M.', 'Baronia, D.A.', 'Wilson Rankin, E.E.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Bees are economically critical pollinators, but are declining broadly due to several stressors, including nontarget exposure to insecticides and deficiencies in nutrition. Understanding the simultaneous impact of stressors, particularly interactions between them, is critical to effectively conserving bees. Although behavioral effects of pesticides like neonicotinoids have received some attention in solitary bees, our understanding of how they are modulated by diet quality is limited. Furthermore, scarce data exist on what concentrations of orally ingested neonicotinoids elicit mortality in solitary bees. In a controlled exposure laboratory experiment, we investigated how diet quality, as sugar concentration, and chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid affect adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius). We provided individuals ad libitum with either 20 or 50% (m/m) sucrose syrups containing either 0, 30, or 300 ppb imidacloprid (measuring 0, 27, and 209 ppb via an ELISA assay). Over 5 wk, we tracked behavior and survivorship of individuals. Imidacloprid decreased survivorship in a dose-dependent fashion, but sucrose content did not affect survivorship, even in bees not fed imidacloprid. In the high imidacloprid treatment, 45% of bees were observed in a motionless supine position while still alive, with this effect appearing to be buffered against by the higher sucrose diet. Our results suggest that diets higher in sugar concentration may prevent an intermediate stage of poisoning, but do not ultimately extend longevity. In devising risk assessments for bees, it is important to consider that interactions between stressors may occur in the stages leading up to death even if survivorship is unaffected. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Sublethal doses of insecticide reduce thermal tolerance of a stingless bee and are not avoided in a resource choice test,149,JOUR,"['Farnan, H.', 'Yeeles, P.', 'Lach, L.']",Royal Society Open Science,"Insecticides and climate change are among the multiple stressors that bees face, but little is known about their synergistic effects, especially for non-Apis bee species. In laboratory experiments, we tested whether the stingless bee Tetragonula hockingsi avoids insecticide in sucrose solutions and how T. hockingsi responds to insecticide and heat stress combined. We found that T. hockingsi neither preferred nor avoided sucrose solutions with either low (2.5 × 10 -4 ng μl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 × 10 -4 ng μl -1 fipronil) or high (2.5 × 10 -3 ng μl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 × 10 -3 ng μl -1 fipronil) insecticide concentrations when offered alongside sucrose without insecticide. In our combined stress experiment, the smallest dose of imidacloprid (7.5 × 10 -4 ng) did not significantly affect thermal tolerance (CT max). However, CT max significantly reduced by 0.8°C (±0.16 SE) and by 0.5°C (±0.16 SE) when bees were fed as little as 7.5 × 10 -3 ng of imidacloprid or 3.0 × 10 -4 ng of fipronil, respectively, and as much as 1.5°C (±0.16 SE) and 1.2°C (±0.16 SE) when bees were fed 7.5 × 10 -2 ng of imidacloprid or 3.0 × 10 -2 ng of fipronil, respectively.

Low Concentration of Quercetin Reduces the Lethal and Sublethal Effects of Imidacloprid on Apis cerana (Hymenoptera: Apidae),86,JOUR,"['Liu, J.', 'Li, Y.', 'Zhang, Z.', 'Luo, W.', 'Cao, L.', 'Liu, H.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Large-scale use of systemic pesticides has been considered a potential factor for pollinator population decline. Phytochemicals, e.g., quercetin, have been demonstrated to increase the pesticide tolerance of Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), which is helpful to develop strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to pollinators. In this study, we hypothesized phytochemicals could reduce the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on Apis cerana Fabricius. The lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana workers were investigated. The results showed that A. cerana workers chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid had a significantly shorter longevity by 10.81 d compared with control. Acute exposure to imidacloprid at 100 μg/liter impaired the sucrose responsiveness and memory retention of the workers, and 20 μg/liter reduced the sucrose responsiveness. The treatment with 37.8 mg/liter quercetin for 24 h could increase the longevity of A. cerana workers when chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid, and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin feeding treatment alleviated the impairment of sucrose responsiveness. However, workers treated with 151.2 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin had a significantly shorter longevity compared to that of bees chronically exposed to 100 μg/liter imidacloprid without quercetin treatment. Our results suggested that quercetin treatment could produce a biphasic influence on the lethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana. Quercetin at 37.8 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter in the diet before pesticide exposure was able to reduce the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, respectively, providing potential strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to native honey bees (A. cerana).  © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Imidacloprid-induced facilitation of the proboscis extension reflex habituation in the honeybee,70,JOUR,"['Lambin, M.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Raymond, S.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology,"Imidacloprid is a new insecticide from the family of the neonicotinoids, which interact with the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The effects of imidacloprid at a dose that does not affect sensory or motor functions are studied on non-associative learning abilities in the honeybee. The behavioral procedure is the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Imidacloprid topically applied on the thorax (1 μl) at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee induces an increase of the gustatory threshold defined as the lowest concentration of a sucrose solution applied to the antennae able to elicit the PER. The ability of the honeybee to move in an open-field-like apparatus is impaired at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee. These effects are amplified with time and reach a maximum 60 min after application. The lowest dose of 1.25 ng/bee has no effect on the gustatory function but increases the motor activity and facilitates the PER habituation independently of time. This result fits our hypothesis that a slight activation of the cholinergic system with a low dose of imidacloprid can facilitate a simple form of learning in the honeybee. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Effects of imidacloprid metabolites on habituation in honeybees suggest the existence of two subtypes of nicotinic receptors differentially expressed during adult development,38,JOUR,"['Guez, D.', 'Belzunces, L.P.', 'Maleszka, R.']",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,"Habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) is age-dependent. Very young bees (≤7 days old) require significantly less trials to abolish the response to multiple sucrose stimulations than older bees (≥8 days old). A nicotinic agonist, imidacloprid, modifies this behaviour by increasing the number of trials in ≤7-day-old bees and by decreasing it in older bees [Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 76 (2001) 183.]. Here we tested our hypothesis that this effect is associated with a differential expression of two subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). By testing the effects of six metabolites of imidacloprid, we show that two of them, olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, modify the number of trials needed to habituate the PER in a contrasting manner. Olefin increases the number of trials in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid decreases the number of trials, but only in 8-day-old individuals. We conclude that olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid are specific agonists of two subtypes of an nAChR that are differentially expressed during adult maturation of young honeybees. Olefin is the agonist of an nAChR expressed in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid is the agonist of a late-onset nAChR that is activated in 8-day-old bees.

"Assessment of lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, ethion, and glyphosate on aversive conditioning, motility, and lifespan in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)",10,JOUR,"['Delkash-Roudsari, S.', 'Chicas-Mosier, A.M.', 'Goldansaz, S.H.', 'Talebi-Jahromi, K.', 'Ashouri, A.', 'Abramson, C.I.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Honeybees (Apis mellifera) play an important role in agriculture worldwide. Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL−1), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL−1) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL−1) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, RoundUp®, was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; RoundUp® showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111108,204,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,29.0
Influence of honey bee seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on diet behavior and susceptibility to imidacloprid,74,JOUR,"['Alburaki, M.', 'Madella, S.', 'Vu, P.', 'Corona, M.']",Apidologie,"Honey bee Apis mellifera L. colonies produce two distinct phenotypes of workers during summer and winter to cope with drastic seasonal variations in climate and food resources. Imidacloprid (IMP) is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture for pest management control. In this study, we investigate the influence of seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on the diet behavior of bees fed ad libitum two concentrations of IMP. We performed three independent two-choice feeding experiments using summer bees either emerged in the laboratory or in-hive and winter bees. Diet behavior post-ingestive aversion responses to IMP were investigated as well as potential affinity to the physical location and contents of the diets. Caged bees were challenged with a physical rotation of the diet’s location and their susceptibility to 5 and 20 PPB of IMP was tested. From a behavioral standpoint, our results show that winter bees expressed no affinity to the physical location of the diet but rather to its content and strongly favored IMP-tainted syrup at both 5 and 20 PPB. The opposite was recorded for naïve summer bees that emerged in the laboratory, which avoided the tainted syrup at both concentrations, particularly at 20 PPB. Summer bees emerged in-hive, expected to have developed a mature intestinal microbiota through trophallaxis from older bee-mates, were mainly neutral, and showed no affinity to the diet location nor its contents. Our results indicate that the physiological changes associated with seasonal phenotype and initial exposure to older mates have important consequences on the bee diet behavior toward pesticides. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00922-9,53,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,30.0

Biopesticide-induced behavioral and morphological alterations in the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata,15,JOUR,"['Barbosa, WF', 'Tomé, HVV', 'Bernardes, RC', 'Siqueira, MAL', 'Smagghe, G', 'Guedes, RNC']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Because of their natural origin, biopesticides are assumed to be less harmful to beneficial insects, including bees, and therefore their use has been widely encouraged for crop protection. There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions.

While it is known that nectar and pollen provide macronutrients, flowers also contain secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that impart benefits including increased longevity, improved gut microbiome abundance, and pathogen tolerance. Our study aims to understand the role of phytochemicals in pesticide tolerance when worker bees were fed with sublethal doses (1 ppb and 10 ppb) of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, in 20% (w/v) sugar solution supplemented with 25 ppm of phytochemicals - caffeine, kaempferol, gallic acid, or p-coumaric acid, previously shown to have beneficial impacts on bee health. The effect of phytochemical supplementation during pesticide exposure was context-dependent. With 1 ppb TMX, phytochemical supplementation increased longevity but at 10 ppb TMX, longevity was reduced suggesting a negative synergistic effect. Phytochemicals mixed with 1 ppb TMX increased mortality in bees of the forager-age group but with 10 ppb TMX, mortality of the inhive-age group increased, implying the possibility of accumulation effect in lower sublethal doses. Given that the phytochemical composition of pollen and nectar varies between plant species, we suggest that the negative impacts of agrochemicals on honey bees could vary based on the phytochemicals in pollen and nectar of that crop, and hence the effects may vary across crops. Analyzing the phytochemical composition for individual crops may be a necessary first step prior to determining the appropriate dosage of agrochemicals so that harm to bees Apis mellifera L. is minimized while crop pests are effectively controlled. © 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2021,10.1093/jisesa/ieab053,21,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,33.0

Previous efforts have employed experimental approaches using small groups under laboratory conditions to investigate influence of these stressors on honey bee physiology and behaviour, although both the colony level and field conditions play a key role for eusocial honey bees. Here, we challenged honey bee workers under in vivo colony conditions with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, the miticide tau-fluvalinate and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae, to investigate potential effects on longevity and behaviour using observation hives. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, our results do not suggest interactions among stressors, but rather lone effects of pesticides and the parasite on mortality and behaviour, respectively. These effects appear to be weak due to different outcomes at the two study sites, thereby suggesting that the role of thiacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and N.ceranae and interactions among them may have been overemphasized. In the future, investigations into the effects of honey bee stressors should prioritize the use of colonies maintained under a variety of environmental conditions in order to obtain more biologically relevant data. © 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015,10.1111/1462-2920.12825,17,0.0,0,0.0,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,34.0

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this context, the use of insecticides with lower residuals and less harmful effects to bees is fundamental. Thus, the objective of the current work was to evaluate, in a laboratory bioassay, the residual toxicity and effect of imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and a mixture of both, when applied on canola in the field, on Africanized A. mellifera workers. Three commercial products were applied, formulated with imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid. Each plot received one of the three treatments, in the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at intervals between 14 and 0 days prior to conducting the bioassays. On the day of the bioassay, the bees were exposed to the plant material containing the treatments for a period of two hours, and were transferred to PVC cages, containing food and water. Mortality assessments were then performed at pre-established intervals until a 96 h post-exposure. Residuals on canola leaves of all tested products caused a significant reduction of honeybee worker longevity, which was less accentuated when the interval after treatment application increased.

A series of field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of two neonicotinoids and one organophosphate insecticide on the foraging activity of honeybee in three test crops at the sub-lethal concentration during flowering. The mean number of the dwarf honeybee (DHB), Apis florea (F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) recorded during the pre-spraying did not differ between treatments on each of the three crops. However, it differed significantly during the post-spraying except for malathion on inflorescences of the pearl millet. The DHB foraging time remained generally constant during the pre-spraying and varied greatly during the post-spraying on the three test crops and both groups of insecticides. The neonicotinoids and malathion significantly reduced visits of the DHB on the inflorescences of the test crops, their foraging activities and time spent on the inflorescences at the concentration many-fold (5-50 fold) less than the field recommended concentration of the insecticide. © 2016 Association for Advancement of Entomology. © 2016 Association for Advancement of Entomology.",2016,,41,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,36.0
Sub-lethal doses of clothianidin inhibit the conditioning and biosensory abilities of the western honeybee apis mellifera,146,JOUR,"['Bartling, M.T.', 'Vilcinskas, A.', 'Lee, K.-Z.']",Insects,"Insects play an important role in the stability of ecosystems by fulfilling key functions such as pollination and nutrient cycling, as well as acting as prey for amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The global decline of insects is therefore a cause for concern, and the role of chemical pesticides must be examined carefully. The lethal effects of insecticides are well understood, but sub-lethal concentrations have not been studied in sufficient detail. We therefore used the western honeybee Apis mellifera as a model to test the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin on the movement, biosensory abilities and odor-dependent conditioning of insects, titrating from lethal to sub-lethal doses. Bees treated with sub-lethal doses showed no significant movement impairment compared to untreated control bees, but their ability to react to an aversive stimulus was inhibited. These results show that clothianidin is not only highly toxic to honeybees, but can, at lower doses, also disrupt the biosensory capabilities of survivors, probably reducing fitness at the individual level. In our study, sub-lethal doses of clothianidin altered the biosensory abilities of the honeybee; possible consequences at the colony level are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,10.3390/insects10100340,10,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,37.0

Assuming bees can forage naturally on pesticide-contaminated or noncontaminated areas, we investigated whether water supply influences the choice between neonicotinoid-dosed or nondosed feeders and on mortality of the stingless bee, Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, Hymenoptera, Apidae). At the field concentration, there was no significant mortality; however, the bees were not able to distinguish the feeders. In the cages containing high-concentration feeders, with water supply, the bees preferred nondosed food, and with no water, the mortality increased. Considering that in the field it is common to find extrapolated concentrations, our work suggested that water may allow avoidance of high dosed food and minimize mortality.  © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Learning, which has been a focus of previous ecotoxicological studies in bees, may play a key role in driving colony fitness. Here we move beyond the standard single-stressor approach to ask how multiple stressors, an agrochemical (sulfoxaflor, a relatively new insecticide) and a parasite (Crithidia bombi, a prevalent gut parasite of bumblebees), impact learning in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We developed a modified version of the classic proboscis extension reflex assay to assess the combined effects of acute oral sulfoxaflor exposure and infection by C. bombi on olfactory learning of bumblebee workers. We found no evidence that either sulfoxaflor, C. bombi, or their combination had any significant effect on bumblebee olfactory learning, despite their known negative impacts on other aspects of bumblebee health. This suggests that losses in cognitive ability, as measured here, are unlikely to explain the impacts of sulfoxaflor and its interactions with other stressors on bumblebees.

Here, we applied a laboratory standard procedure (the proboscis-extension response conditioning) in order to assess which processes, acquisition, memory consolidation and/or memory retrieval were compromised after bees were fed either with thiacloprid or the formulation of thiacloprid named Calypso® at different sublethal doses. Extinction and generalization tests allowed us to investigate whether bees respond to a learned stimulus, and how selectively.

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybees’ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,43.0

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. © 2021",2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,46.0

This study measured memory with the proboscis extension response (PER) assay as well as the expression of neural genes in bees chronically exposed to three different sublethal doses of the insecticide clothianidin and/or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The proportion of bees that positively responded to PER at 24 and 48 h post-training (hpt) was significantly reduced when exposed to clothianidin. V. destructor parasitism reduced the proportion of bees that responded to PER at 48 hpt. Combined effects between the lowest clothianidin dose and V. destructor for the proportion of bees that responded to PER were found at 24 hpt. Clothianidin, V. destructor and their combination differentially affected the expression of the neural-related genes, AmNrx-1 (neurexin), AmNlg-1 (neuroligin), and AmAChE-2 (acetylcholinesterase). Different doses of clothianidin down-regulated or up-regulated the genes, whereas V. destructor tended to have a down-regulatory effect.

We then exposed Bombus impatiens workers to varying concentrations of these chemicals via their diet and assayed direct effects on bee survival. Using field-realistic doses, we further explored the indirect effects on bee microbiomes. We found multiple putative genes in core gut microbes that may aid in detoxifying harmful chemicals. We also found that while the chemicals are largely toxic at levels within and above field-realistic concentrations, the field-realistic concentrations-except for imidacloprid-altered the composition of the bee microbiome, potentially causing gut dysbiosis.

The efficacy of seven honeybee gut bacterial strains in reducing insecticide toxicity was evaluated. Through the identification of honeybee gut bacterial isolates using 16s rRNA, seven strains were identified, namely Priestia endophytica, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Peribacillus frigoritolerans, B. subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus tequilensis. The experimental results revealed that bees treated with these gut bacteria significantly reduced oxidative stress markers and detoxification enzyme levels compared to untreated bees. Moreover, the treated bees demonstrated enhanced immune responses. The bees treated with deltamethrin + intestinal bacteria showed an increase in bees’ lifespan to 6.33 days compared to a lifespan of 4 days with deltamethrin only. Similarly, bees treated with acetamiprid intestinal bacteria had further extended to 10.33 days compared to a lifespan of 7.67 days with acetamiprid. These findings suggest that using honeybee gut bacterial strains may serve as a sustainable strategy to mitigate the harmful impacts of insecticides on honeybees, thereby promoting their overall health and contributing to the preservation of pollination services and apiculture. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and optimize the application of these natural products in honeybee management practices. © (2024), (Slovak University of Agriculture).

Overwhelming evidence has shown elevated colony losses for honey bees and a decrease in the abundance of other pollinators. Insecticides of the neonicotinoid type have been associated with these losses, but few studies have explored how residual exposure doses affect the queen’s energy metabolism. Here, we studied how a residual dose of neonicotinoid (imidacloprid), combined with reproductive status (virgin and inseminated) affects honey bee queen’s metabolism. We conducted the same experiment in two geographical locations (Chile and Colombia) and found a strong reduction of standard metabolic rate (SMR) in insecticide-treated queens (Chilean queen bees 11.3% reduction in watt output; Colombian queen bees 11.7% reduction in watt output). No effects were found when comparing reproductive condition on SMR.

Resistance and Vulnerability of Honeybee (Apis mellifera) Gut Bacteria to Commonly Used Pesticides,130,JOUR,"['Cuesta-Maté, A.', 'Renelies-Hamilton, J.', 'Kryger, P.', 'Jensen, A.B.', 'Sinotte, V.M.', 'Poulsen, M.']",Frontiers in Microbiology,"Agricultural and apicultural practices expose honeybees to a range of pesticides that have the potential to negatively affect their physiology, neurobiology, and behavior. Accumulating evidence suggests that these effects extend to the honeybee gut microbiome, which serves important functions for honeybee health. Here we test the potential effects of the pesticides thiacloprid, acetamiprid, and oxalic acid on the gut microbiota of honeybees, first in direct in vitro inhibition assays and secondly in an in vivo caged bee experiment to test if exposure leads to gut microbiota community changes. We found that thiacloprid did not inhibit the honeybee core gut bacteria in vitro, nor did it affect overall community composition or richness in vivo. Acetamiprid did also not inhibit bacterial growth in vitro, but it did affect community structure within bees. The eight bacterial genera tested showed variable levels of susceptibility to oxalic acid in vitro. In vivo, treatment with this pesticide reduced amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and affected gut microbiome composition, with most marked impact on the common crop bacteria Lactobacillus kunkeei and the genus Bombella. We conducted network analyses which captured known associations between bacterial members and illustrated the sensitivity of the microbiome to environmental stressors. Our findings point to risks of honeybee exposure to oxalic acid, which has been deemed safe for use in treatment against Varroa mites in honeybee colonies, and we advocate for more extensive assessment of the long-term effects that it may have on honeybee health. © Copyright © 2021 Cuesta-Maté, Renelies-Hamilton, Kryger, Jensen, Sinotte and Poulsen.",2021,10.3389/fmicb.2021.717990,12,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,53.0
Low concentrations of imidacloprid affect the survival of Tetragona clavipes in a short period of exposure (24 h),87,JOUR,"['de Oliveira, A.A.', 'Carvalho, L.O.', 'dos Santos, H.V.R.', 'de Oliveira, L.R.G.R.', 'Saraiva, A.S.']",Apidologie,"Neonicotinoid pesticides are widely used to control insect pests in agriculture and livestock production. However, they have been found to negatively affect bees, especially Apis mellifera. Despite this, little research has been conducted on the impact of neonicotinoids on other bee species, including native ones. This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI). The Tetragona clavipes (bee native to Brazil) were exposed to eight concentrations of IMI-based insecticide, through contaminated food or mist (350 µL/min) for 24 h. The LC10-24 h, LC50-24 h, LC90-24 h in acute topical effect (ATE) and acute residual effect (ARE) of IMI-based insecticide against bees were calculated. The LC10-24 h, LC50-24 h, and LC90-24 h in ARE were found to be more toxic compared to ATE. In summary, the study highlights that even low levels of IMI can significantly reduce bee survival within 24 h. The urgency to tackle the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on native bee populations is evident. Preserving bees is crucial for ensuring sustainability, food security, and ecosystem integrity.

However, in this study, bees were exposed to relatively high glyphosate concentrations. Here, we chronically exposed newly emerged honey bees to imidacloprid, glyphosate and difenoconazole, individually and in a ternary mixture, at an environmental concentration of 0.1 mu g/L. We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals exhibit a dysbiosis (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota). This highlights the importance of an early establishment of a healthy gut bacterial community to strengthen the natural defenses of the honey bee against xenobiotic stressors.",2022,10.1038/s41598-022-08009-2,12,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,1.0,55.0

Both can affect honey bee physiology and microbial gut communities, eventually reducing its lifespan. They can also have a combined effect on the insect’s survival. The use of bacterial probiotics has been proposed to improve honey bee health, but their beneficial effect remains an open question. In the present study, western honey bees were experimentally infected with N. ceranae spores, chronically exposed to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, and/or supplied daily with the homofermentative bacterium Pediococcus acidilactici MA18/5M thought to improve the honey bees’ tolerance to the parasite. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowed the response of the gut microbiota to be investigated with a taxonomic resolution at the species level. All treatments induced significant changes in honey bee gut bacterial communities. Nosema ceranae infection increased the abundance of Proteus mirabilis, Frischella perrara, and Gilliamella apicola and reduced the abundance of Bifidobacterium asteroides, Fructobacillus fructosus, and Lactobacillus spp. Supplementation with P. acidilactici overturned some of these alterations, bringing back the abundance of some altered species close to the relative abundance found in the controls. Surprisingly, the exposure to thiamethoxam also restored the relative abundance of some species modulated by N. ceranae.

Lotmaria passim, a ubiquitous unicellular parasite in honey bees, is considered harmful under specific conditions. Imidacloprid causes unpredictable side effects. Research indicates that both L. passim and imidacloprid may affect the physiology, behavior, immunity, microbiome and lifespan of honey bees. We designed cage experiments to test whether the infection of L. passim is affected by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. Workers collected at the time of emergence were exposed to L. passim and 2.5 μg/L imidacloprid in the coexposure treatment group. First, samples of bees were taken from cages since they were 5 days old and 3 days postinfection, i.e., after finishing an artificial 24 h L. passim infection. Additional bees were collected every two additional days. In addition, bees frozen at the time of emergence and collected from the unexposed group were analyzed. Abdomens were analyzed using qPCR to determine parasite load, while corresponding selected heads were subjected to a label-free proteomic analysis. Our results show that bees are free of L. passim at the time of emergence. Furthermore, imidacloprid considerably increased the prevalence as well as parasite loads in individual bees. This means that imidacloprid facilitates infection, enabling faster parasite spread in a colony and potentially to surrounding colonies. The proteomic analysis of bee heads showed that imidacloprid neutralized the increased transferrin 1 expression by L. passim. Importantly, this promising marker has been previously observed to be upregulated by infections, including gut parasites. This study contributes to understanding the side effects of imidacloprid and demonstrates that a single xenobiotic/pesticide compound can interact with the gut parasite. Our methodology can be used to assess the effects of different compounds on L. passim. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166973,905,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,58.0
Neonicotinoid-induced impairment of odour coding in the honeybee,99,JOUR,"['Andrione, M', 'Vallortigara, G', 'Antolini, R', 'Haase, A']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the possible causes of honeybee (Apis mellifera) population decline. At sublethal doses, these chemicals have been shown to negatively affect a number of behaviours, including performance of olfactory learning and memory, due to their interference with acetylcholine signalling in the mushroom bodies. Here we provide evidence that neonicotinoids can affect odour coding upstream of the mushroom bodies, in the first odour processing centres of the honeybee brain, i.e. the antennal lobes (ALs). In particular, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid, the most common neonicotinoid, in the AL glomeruli via in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with pulsed odour stimulation. Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016,10.1038/srep38110,6,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,59.0
Neonicotinoids override a parasite exposure impact onhibernation success of a key bumblebee pollinator,105,JOUR,"['Fauser, A', 'Sandrock, C', 'Neumann, P', 'Sadd, B']",ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,"1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.",2017,10.1111/een.12385,42,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,60.0

The increasing prevalence of CCD is a threat to the economic and nutritional security of all societies that rely on efficient pollination for large monoculture crops. Although there is ample evidence that Varroa mites, pesticides, disease, and climate change contribute to CCD, only a few studies have investigated the contribution of synergism across multiple factors to the development of CCD and CCD-like symptoms. However, there is increasing acknowledgement in the scientific community that synergism across different factors affects honey bee colony health and behavior.

Mating is vital for the population maintenance of bumblebees. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research conducted on the effects of pesticides on the mating process. In this study, we individually examined the impact of imidacloprid on the mating behavior of bumblebee males and queens. A competitive mating experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect on the competitive prowess of male individuals and the mate selection behavior of female individuals. The study revealed that the mating rate of bumblebees exposed to a concentration of 10 ppb of imidacloprid was 3 %. This finding demonstrated a statistically significant impact when compared to the control group, which exhibited a mating rate of 58 % in the normal mating experiment. Furthermore, in the competitive mating experiment, we found that the competitive mating success rate of treated males (1 %) was significantly lower than that of untreated males (35 %).

"Sublethal acetamiprid exposure induces immunity, suppresses pathways linked to juvenile hormone synthesis in queens and affects cycle-related signaling in emerging bees",148,JOUR,"['Erban, T.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Sopko, B.']",Environmental Pollution,"Acetamiprid is the only neonicotinoid registered in the European Union because the risks of neonicotinoids to honey bees and other pollinators are strictly regulated. Herein, we orally exposed honey bee colonies to sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid (20 μg/L) under isolated conditions. After one month of continuous exposure, the emerging bees and queens were collected and analyzed via high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics using a data-independent acquisition strategy. Six and 34 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the emerging bees and queens, respectively. Mrjp3 was the only DEP found in both sample types/castes, and its opposite regulation illustrated a differential response. The DEPs in the emerging bees (H/ACA RNP, Rap1GAP, Mrjp3, and JHE) suggested that sublethal exposure to acetamiprid affected cell cycle-related signaling, which may affect the life history of workers in the colony. The DEPs with increased levels in queens, such as Mrjps 1–4 and 6–7, hymenoptaecin, and apidaecin 22, indicated an activated immune response. Additionally, the level of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the mevalonate pathway and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in queens. The impaired utilization of juvenile hormone in queens supported the identification of additional DEPs. Furthermore, the proteome changes suggested the existence of increased neonicotinoid detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and increased amino acid metabolism. The results suggest that the continuous exposure of bee colonies to acetamiprid at low doses (nanograms per gram in feed) may pose a threat to the colonies. The different exposure routes and durations for the emerging bees and queens in our experiment must be considered, i.e., the emerging bees were exposed as larvae via feeding royal jelly and beebread provided by workers (nurse bees), whereas the queens were fed royal jelly throughout the experiment.

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees.

The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,174,JOUR,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

Actually, a short time interval of 24 h between individually applied potentially synergistic products like pyrethroid insecticides and EBI fungicides led to an increase of mortality up to 100% under laboratory conditions, indicating that the detoxification was still ongoing, resulting in an increased susceptibility for other stressors during the metabolization process. In conclusion, tank mixtures do not always lead to an increase of honey bee toxicity. However, former published findings about synergistic impacts between neonicotinoides and EBI-fungicides could be confirmed. The findings of our and other higher tier studies finally prompted the competent regulatory authority (BVL) to regulate these mixtures by restriction NB6613 since September 2018. Nevertheless, the investigation of potential interactions between mixing partners and their additive or synergistic effects are the basis for a better understanding and a logical risk assessment to ensure protection of honey bees. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019,10.1007/s00003-019-01233-5,14,,0,0.0,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,68.0

The regulatory challenge to determine safe levels of residual pesticides can benefit from information about the time-dependent toxicity of this chemical. Using published toxicity data for imidacloprid for several insect species, we construct time-to-lethal-effect toxicity plots and fit temporal power-law scaling curves to the data. The level of toxic exposure that results in 50% mortality after time t is found to scale as t 1.7 for ants, from t 1.6 to t 5 for honeybees, and from t 1.46 to t 2.9 for termites. We present a simple toxicological model that can explain t 2 scaling. Extrapolating the toxicity scaling for honeybees to the lifespan of winter bees suggests that imidacloprid in honey at 0.25 μ ... 1/4g/kg would be lethal to a large proportion of bees nearing the end of their life.",2014,10.1038/srep05566,4,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,69.0
The influence of acetamiprid and deltamethrin on the mortality and behaviour of honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica Pollman) in oilseed rape cultivations,166,JOUR,"['Dworzańska, D.', 'Moores, G.', 'Zamojska, J.', 'Strażyński, P.', 'Węgorek, P.']",Apidologie,"The aim of the research was to determine the influence of acetamiprid and deltamethrin on the mortality and behaviour of honeybees of the same variety, coming from the same source and estimated to be in good condition by a professional beekeeper, but in different years and under different weather conditions. Results of research conducted in field isolators in oilseed rape fields in the years 2012–2018 showed no acetamiprid influence either on the mortality or on the behaviour of honeybees. Deltamethrin activity differed from a lack of influence through causing mortality and a weaker condition of honeybee colonies to the destruction of the colony. This demonstrates the relative safety of acetamiprid to honeybees and the high risk of deltamethrin use. The differences in the bee colonies’ reaction to deltamethrin are probably caused by the high acute toxicity of this active ingredient, genetically dependent, variable metabolic capabilities of particular bee colonies, or coexistence of a variety of different stressors—mainly pathogens. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,10.1007/s13592-020-00792-z,51,,0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,0.0,,1.0,70.0

Exposure and risk assessment of acetamiprid in honey bee colonies under a real exposure scenario in Eucalyptus sp. landscapes,51,JOUR,"['Capela, N.', 'Xu, M.', 'Simões, S.', 'Azevedo-Pereira, H.M.S.V.', 'Peters, J.', 'Sousa, J.P.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Honey bee colonies have shown abnormal mortality rates over the last decades. Colonies are exposed to biotic and abiotic stressors including landscape changes caused by human pressure. Modern agriculture and even forestry, rely on pesticide inputs and these chemicals have been indicated as one of the major causes for colony losses. Neonicotinoids are a common class of pesticides used worldwide that are specific to kill insect pests, with acetamiprid being the only neonicotinoid allowed to be applied outdoors in the EU. To evaluate honeybees' exposure to acetamiprid under field conditions as well as to test the use of in-situ tools to monitor pesticide residues, two honeybee colonies were installed in five Eucalyptus sp. plantations having different area where Epik® (active substance: acetamiprid) was applied as in a common spraying event to control the eucalyptus weevil pest. Flowers, fresh nectar, honey bees and colony products samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of acetamiprid residues. Our main findings were that (1) acetamiprid residues were found in samples collected outside the spraying area, (2) the amount of residues transported into the colonies increased with the size of the sprayed area, (3) according to the calculated Exposure to Toxicity Ratio (ETR) values, spraying up to 22 % of honeybees foraging area does not harm the colonies, (4) colony products can be used as a valid tool to monitor colony accumulation of acetamiprid and (5) the use of Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs) can be a cheap, fast and easy tool to apply in the field, to evaluate the presence of acetamiprid residues in the landscape and colony products. © 2022",2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156485,840,,0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,72.0

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), are heavily affected by pest control practices that incorporate insecticides. Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,76.0
Exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to three different active ingredients and two application methods for olive pest control,52,JOUR,"['Varikou, K', 'Garantonakis, N', 'Birouraki, A']",ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS,"A potential cause of bumblebee losses on farmland is probably the toxic effects of insecticides used against crop pests. The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is a major pest of olive trees in Mediterranean countries, so spray treatments (cover and bait sprays) are applied for this and other minor pests starting in early spring. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three pesticide spraying solutions (alpha-cypennethrin, dimethoate, and spinosad) and control methods used against olive fruit flies and other olive tree pests, on adult buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The results indicated that exposing worker bumblebees to enviromnentally realistic levels of these active ingredients in the laboratory resulted in high mortality rates of 34% (alpha-cypermethrin, cover spray) and 54% (alpha-cypermethrin, bait spray) at the end of the three-day exposure period. Bumblebees are probably at a high risk of mortality when they forage in olive groves with dry residues of a bait solution of a-cypennethrin (which resulted in 54% mortality in this study). Spinosad and dimethoate posed a lower risk of mortality for bumblebees. However, when the tested chemicals were applied to the whole tree canopy and without the bait attractant, the recorded mortality for dimethoate and a-cypennethrin was 8% and 34%, respectively. This study contributes to optimizing the use of the tested active ingredients as well as the applied control methods against managed pests, because it inflicts definite damage to populations of bumble bees and other non-target pollination.",2019,10.1127/entomologia/2019/0706,39,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,77.0

The composition of the microbial community can be used as a biological health indicator and is characterized using biomarker fatty acids. Commonly, gut microorganisms are exposed to pathogens and to an array of chemical and biological pest control methods. RESULTS: We found a strong negative effect on microbial gut community composition when exposed to the bee pest control chemicals oxytetracycline, oxalic acid and imidacloprid, and when inoculated with the bee pest Nosema spp. and the potential bee pest biocontrol agent Lactobacillus plantarum. Results from the in vitro test with bee pest chemicals showed a differential response of Lactobacillus spp. At the community level, some taxonomic groups were more affected depending on treatment, but sharp changes in the microbial structure were caused by compounds generally considered as bee safe. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pests such as Nosema spp. and pest control methods alter the composition of bee gut microorganisms, which may have severe consequences for pathogen defense, physiology and general honey bee health.

Sublethal pesticide exposure induces larval removal behavior in honeybees through chemical cues,152,JOUR,"['Schuehly, W', 'Riessberger-Gallé, U', 'López, JH']",ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"We were intrigued by reported observations of reduced brood production and a high number of empty brood cells in bee colonies exposed to sublethal pesticide doses, which could suggest an active removal of larvae. Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies. Larvae that had been fed either the pesticide or LPS were removed at a significantly higher rate than control larvae.

Seed-coating of rapeseed (Brassica napus) with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affects behaviour of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and pollination of strawberry flowers (Fragaria × ananassa),137,JOUR,"['Herbertsson, L.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Blasi, M.', 'Rundlöf, M.', 'Smith, H.G.']",PLoS ONE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides applied to flowering crops can have negative impacts on bees, with implications for crop pollination. To assess if exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin via a treated crop (rapeseed) affected bee behaviour, pollination performance (to strawberry), and bee reproduction, we provided each of 12 outdoor cages with rapeseed (autumn-sown plants complemented with a few spring-sown plants to extend the flowering period) grown from either clothianidin-treated or untreated (control) seeds, together with strawberry plants and a small population of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). We expected clothianidin to reduce bee foraging activity, resulting in impaired strawberry pollination and bee reproduction. During the early stage of the experiment, we observed no difference between treatments in the length of entire foraging trips, or the combined number of rapeseed and strawberry flowers that the bees visited during these trips. During the later stage of the experiment, we instead determined the time a female took to visit 10 rapeseed flowers, as a proxy for foraging performance. We found that they were 10% slower in clothianidin cages. Strawberries weighed less in clothianidin cages, suggesting reduced pollination performance, but we were unable to relate this to reduced foraging activity, because the strawberry flowers received equally many visits in the two treatments. Clothianidin-exposed females sealed their nests less often, but offspring number, sex ratio and weight were similar between treatments. Observed effects on bee behaviour appeared by the end of the experiment, possibly because of accumulated effects of exposure, reduced bee longevity, or higher sensitivity of the protocols we used during the later phase of the experiment. Although the lack of a mechanistic explanation calls for interpreting the results with cautiousness, the lower strawberry weight in clothianidin cages highlights the importance of understanding complex effects of plant protection products, which could have wider consequences than those on directly exposed organisms.  © 2022 Herbertsson et al.

Floral resource diversification promotes solitary bee reproduction and may offset insecticide effects – evidence from a semi-field experiment,60,JOUR,"['Klaus, F.', 'Tscharntke, T.', 'Bischoff, G.', 'Grass, I.']",Ecology Letters,"Pollinator declines in agricultural landscapes are driven by multiple stressors, but potential interactions of these remain poorly studied. Using a highly replicated semi-field study with 56 mesocosms of varying wild plant diversity (2–16 species) and oilseed rape treated with a neonicotinoid, we tested the interacting effects of resource diversity and insecticides on reproduction of a solitary wild bee. Compared to mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures, availability of resources from wild plants complementing oilseed rape doubled brood cell production. In addition, bee reproduction increased due to plant diversity and identity effects. Exposure to neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape reduced bee larval to adult development by 69%, but only in mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures. Availability of complementary flower resources can thus offset negative effects of neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape on wild bee reproduction. Policy should encourage the implementation of diverse floral resources mitigating negative effects of crop monocultures and insecticides, thereby sustaining solitary bee populations in agricultural landscapes. © 2021 The Authors.

"Laboratory Determination of Particulate-Matter–Bound Agrochemical Toxicity among Honeybees, Mason Bees, and Painted Lady Butterflies",81,JOUR,"['Green, F.B.', 'Muñoz, S.R.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Pollinator population declines are global phenomena with severe consequences for native flora and agriculture. Many factors have contributed to pollinator declines including habitat loss, climate change, disease and parasitism, reductions in abundance and diversity of foraging resources, and agrochemical exposure. Particulate matter (PM) serves as a carrier of toxic agrochemicals, and pollinator mortality can occur following exposure to agrochemical-contaminated PM. Therefore, laboratory-controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate impacts of individual PM-bound agrochemicals. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria), and painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) larvae were exposed to bifenthrin, permethrin, clothianidin, imidacloprid, abamectin, and ivermectin via suspended, airborne PM. Agrochemical concentrations in PM to which pollinators were exposed were based on concentrations observed in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM including a “mean” treatment and a “max” treatment reflective of reported mean and maximum PM-bound agrochemical concentrations, respectively. In general, pollinators in the mean and max treatments experienced significantly higher mortality compared with controls. Honeybees were most sensitive to pyrethroids, mason bees were most sensitive to neonicotinoids, and painted lady butterfly larvae were most sensitive to macrocyclic lactones. Overall, pollinator mortality was quite low relative to established toxic effect levels derived from traditional pollinator contact toxicity tests. Furthermore, pollinator mortality resulting from exposure to individual agrochemicals via PM was less than that reported to occur at beef cattle feedyards, highlighting the importance of mixture toxicity to native and managed pollinator survival and conservation.

Analysis and evaluation of (neuro)peptides in honey bees exposed to pesticides in field conditions,7,JOUR,"['Gómez-Ramos, M.D.M.', 'Gómez Ramos, M.J.', 'Martínez Galera, M.', 'Gil García, M.D.', 'Fernández-Alba, A.R.']",Environmental Pollution,"During the last years, declines in honey bee colonies are being registered worldwide. Cholinergic pesticides and their extensive use have been correlated to the decline of pollinators and there is evidence that pesticides act as neuroendocrine disruptors affecting the metabolism of neuropeptides. However, there is a big absence of studies with quantitative results correlating the effect of pesticide exposure with changes on neuropeptides insects, and most of them are conducted under laboratory conditions, typically with individual active ingredients. In this study, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate pesticide effects on honey bees through the analysis of (neuro)peptides. The workflow consists of a rapid extraction method and liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole for preselected neuropeptides. For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≥ 500 μg kg−1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≤ 20 μg kg−1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins. It has been shown a correlation between pesticide exposure and a decrease of some neuropeptides and other head peptides in honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.091,235,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1.0,87.0
Fatal powdering of bees in flight with particulates of neonicotinoids seed coating and humidity implication,55,JOUR,"['Girolami, V.', 'Marzaro, M.', 'Vivan, L.', 'Mazzon, L.', 'Greatti, M.', 'Giorio, C.', 'Marton, D.', 'Tapparo, A.']",Journal of Applied Entomology,"Losses of honeybees have been reported in Italy concurrent with the sowing of corn coated with neonicotinoids using a pneumatic drilling machine. Being unconvinced that solid particles containing systemic insecticide, falling on the vegetation surrounding the sown area, could poison bees foraging on contaminated nectar and pollen, the effect of direct aerial powdering was tested on foragers in free flight near the drilling machine. Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed. Spring bee losses, which corresponded with the sowing of corn-coated seed, seemed to be related to the casual encountering of drilling machine during foraging flight across the ploughed fields. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, GmbH.",2012,10.1111/j.1439-0418.2011.01648.x,136,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,88.0
Effect of aerial spraying of thiacloprid on pine sawyer beetles (Monochamus alternatus) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) in pine forests,31,JOUR,"['Suh, D.Y.', 'Jung, J.-K.', 'Lee, S.K.', 'Seo, S.-T.']",Entomological Research,"Monochamus alternatus is a very important vector of the pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) which is the causal agent of pine wilt disease. To reduce population density of M. alternatus, thiacloprid has been sprayed by aircrafts on pine forests. Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not. Consequently, thiacloprid sprayed by aircraft may be an effective control agent for Monochamus beetle adults without negative effect on honey bees, but aerial application to prevent expansion of pine wilt disease should be reassessed. © 2020 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2021,10.1111/1748-5967.12482,51,,0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,89.0
Spinosad - a naturally derived insect control agent with potential for use in integrated pest management systems in greenhouses,143,CONF,"['Miles, M', 'Dutton, R', 'BCPC', 'BCPC']","BCPC CONFERENCE: PESTS & DISEASES 2000, VOLS 1-3, PROCEEDINGS","When used according to good horticultural practice, spinosad was shown to be compatible with predatory mites (Typhlodromus pyri, Phytoseiultrs persimilis and Amblyseius californicus), predatory Heteroptera (Orius insidiosus, O. laevigatus and Macrolophus callginosus), Coccinellidae (Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septempunctata) and Neuroptera (Chrysoperla carnea and C. rufibularis). Parasitic Hymenoptera were sensitive to spinosad, however toxic effects were short lived due to the low persistence of spinosad. Consequently species such as Aphidius colemani and Encarsia formosa can be introduced to protected crops soon after application (1-2 weeks). Semi-field studies were also conducted on honey and bumble bees. Spinosad was applied when bees were not flying. Bees were allowed to forage on the treated plants when spray deposits had dried. The findings from these studies showed that spinosad was completely safe to foraging worker bees. No significantly adverse effects on queen or brood were observed on either species. It can be concluded that spinosad is highly selective to beneficials and pollinators making it an ideal insect control product for use within glasshouse IPM programmes.",2000,,01-Mar,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,90.0
Efficacy of spinosad bait sprays to control Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) in commercial citrus in Florida,47,JOUR,"['Burns, R.E.', 'Harris, D.L.', 'Moreno, D.S.', 'Eger, J.E.']",Florida Entomologist,"A serious infestation of Mediterranean fruit fly in Florida in 1997 and 1998 led to the widespread aerial and foliar application of malathion-bait sprays. Public concerns over property damage, environmental impact and public health led to the immediate need and acceptability of alternative pesticide/bait combinations. Preliminary work with spinosad, a derivative of a soil microorganism developed by Dow AgroSciences, in combination with a new bait (SolBait) showed promise. To ensure that this product would be effective in Florida for fruit fly control, three field tests were conducted using aerial and/or foliar applications. Results indicated that sprays with spinosad-SolBait provided comparable and significant control levels for sterile Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies in comparison to standard malathion with NU-LURE® or SolBait treatments by aerial or foliar application. In one test, honey bees and hives were exposed to sprays in the treatment area and no significant treatment differences were observed in hive condition or brood. Insufficient data on effects of treatments on naturally occurring and introduced beneficial insects were collected for statistical analysis but it appears no harmful effects were observed.",2001,10.2307/3496400,84,,0,0.0,,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,91.0
The impact of thiamethoxam on bumble bee broods (Bombus terrestris L.) following drip application in covered tomato crops,165,JOUR,"['Sechser, B.', 'Freuler, J.']",Anzeiger fur Schadlingskunde,"The side effects of the neonicotinyl compound thiamethoxam on the brood of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) were investigated on tomatoes in plastic tunnels and glasshouses. Preceeding trials had revealed a strong contact and stomach activity of the compound by foliar application. A decisive improvement was obtained by replacing the foliar by drip irrigation of thiamethoxam at rates between 150 and 161 g ai/ha. The mortality figures of all bumble bee stages dropped to the level in the untreated control. No dead bumble bees were found in the thiamethoxam treated tunnels/glasshouses on the ground. Thiamethoxam could be rated as being harmless to bumble bees with a single application through the irrigation system. No spilling of this compound during the application should occur to avoid intoxication of adult humble bees by oral uptake or contact contamination during the cleaning process. If multiple applications via the irrigation system or under any hydroponic growing conditions is considered, further sequential testing of this mode of use is recommended.",2003,10.1046/j.1439-0280.2003.03017.x,76,,0,,0.0,0.0,,,,,0.0,,,,0.0,,0.0,,1.0,92.0
