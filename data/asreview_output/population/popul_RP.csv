287,713,JOUR,Population growth and insecticide residues of honey bees in tropical agricultural landscapes,"['Buchori, D.', 'Rizali, A.', 'Priawandiputra, W.', 'Sartiami, D.', 'Johannis, M.']",Diversity,"Global decline of pollinators, especially bees, has been documented in many countries. Several causes such as land-use change and agricultural intensification are reported to be the main drivers of the decline. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of land use on honey bee and stingless bee populations. Research was conducted in Bogor and Malang to compare between two different geographical areas. Managed bees such as honey bees (Apis cerana and A. mellifera) and stingless bees (Tetragonula laeviceps) were investigated to examine the effect of agricultural intensification. Field experiments were conducted by placing beehives in selected habitats (i.e., beekeeper gardens, forests areas, and agriculture areas). Population growth and neonicotinoid residue analysis of bees in different hive locations were measured to study the effect of habitat type. Population growth of bees represents the forager abundance and colony weight. Based on the analysis, we found that habitat type affected forager abundance and colony weight of honey bees (p < 0.05), although the patterns were different between species, region, as well as season. Forests could support the stingless bee colony better than agriculture and home garden habitats. Insecticide (neonicotinoid) was barely recorded in both honey bees and stingless bees. ¬© 2019 by the authors.",2020///,2020,10.3390/d12010001,12.0,1,,,,,"['agricultural intensification', 'agricultural land', 'Agriculture', 'Apis cerana', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'environmental disturbance', 'Forests', 'home garden', 'Home garden', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'land use change', 'Meliponinae', 'Neonicotinoid', 'pesticide residue', 'population growth', 'Tetragonula laeviceps', 'tropical forest']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078663694&doi=10.3390%2fd12010001&partnerID=40&md5=adea08e06d4526ffcbd6c834676eae1a,Scopus,,1,,1,1

Despite being important pollinators, solitary ground-nesting bees are inadequately represented by pesticide risk assessments reliant almost exclusively on honeybee ecotoxicology. Here we evaluate the effects of realistic exposure via squash crops treated with systemic insecticides (Admire-imidacloprid soil application, FarMore FI400-thiamethoxam seed-coating, or Coragen-chlorantraniliprole foliar spray) for a ground-nesting bee species (Hoary squash bee,¬†Eucera pruinosa) in a 3-year semi-field experiment. Hoary squash bees provide essential pollination services to pumpkin and squash crops and commonly nest within cropping areas increasing their risk of pesticide exposure from soil, nectar, and pollen. When exposed to a crop treated at planting with soil-applied imidacloprid, these bees initiated 85% fewer nests, left 5.3 times more pollen unharvested, and produced 89% fewer offspring than untreated controls. No measurable impacts on bees from exposure to squash treated with thiamethoxam as a seed-coating or foliage sprayed with chlorantraniliprole were found. Our results demonstrate important sublethal effects of field-realistic exposure to a soil-applied neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bee behaviour and reproductive success. Soil must be considered a potential route of pesticide exposure in risk assessments, and restrictions on soil-applied insecticides may be justified, to mitigate impacts on ground-nesting solitary bee populations and the crop pollination services they provide. ¬© 2021, The Author(s).",2021///,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-83341-7,11.0,1,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Canada', 'crop', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'drug effect', 'environment', 'Environment', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'population density', 'Population Density']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101276239&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-83341-7&partnerID=40&md5=f57f8a9b81b8c45d85d8afc83465b601,Scopus,,1,,1,2

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2‚Äì3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. The feeding study data are also compared to the outcomes of regulatory Tier 1 risk assessments conducted using guidance provided by the USA, Canada, Brazil and the EU regulatory authorities.

Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-Term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure. ¬© The Author(s) 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep32108,6.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984690386&doi=10.1038%2fsrep32108&partnerID=40&md5=e4a56e5fa82ba7e8148aa6852c92504d,Scopus,,1,,1,5

Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a butenolide insecticide that shares the same mode of action as neonicotinoids and has been assessed to be 'practically non-toxic to adult honeybees' using current risk assessment procedures. However, these assessments overlook some routes of exposure specific to wild bees, such as contact with residues in soil for ground-nesters. Co-exposure with other pesticides may also lead to detrimental synergistic effects. In a fully crossed experiment, we assessed the possible lethal and sublethal effects of chronic exposure to two pesticides used on Cucurbita crops, the insecticide Sivanto Prime (FPF) and the fungicide Quadris Top (azoxystrobin and difenoconazole), alone or combined, on solitary ground-nesting squash bees (Xenoglossa pruinosa). Squash bees exposed to Quadris Top collected less pollen per flower visit, while Sivanto-exposed bees produced larger offspring. Pesticide co-exposure induced hyperactivity in female squash bees relative to both the control and single pesticide exposure, and reduced the number of emerging offspring per nest compared to individual pesticide treatments.

554,844,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Environmental Entomology,"Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

530,827,JOUR,Thiamethoxam honey bee colony feeding study: Linking effects at the level of the individual to those at the colony level,"['Overmyer, J.', 'Feken, M.', 'Ruddle, N.', 'Bocksch, S.', 'Hill, M.', 'Thompson, H.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been used globally on a wide range of crops through seed treatment as well as soil and foliar applications and have been increasingly studied in relation to the potential risk to bees because of their detection in pollen and nectar of bee-attractive crops. The present article reports the results of laboratory studies (10-d adult and 22-d larval toxicity studies assessing the chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam to adult honey bees and larvae, respectively) and a colony feeding study, with 6 wk of exposure in an area with limited alternative forage, to provide a prewintering colony-level endpoint. The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

175,811,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure and monofloral diet on nest-founding bumblebee queens,"['Leza, M.', 'Watrous, K.M.', 'Bratu, J.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Bumblebees are among the world‚Äôs most important groups of pollinating insects in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Each spring, queen bumblebees emerge from overwintering and initiate new nests, which ultimately give rise to workers and new reproductives later in the season. Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We performed the first laboratory experiment with the model bumblebee species Bombus impatiens that explores how early nesting success is impacted by the effects of temporary or more sustained exposure to sublethal levels of a neonicotinoid-type insecticide (imidacloprid at 5 ppb in nectar) and by reliance on a monofloral pollen diet, two factors that have been previously implicated in bumblebee decline. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production. These findings speak to the sensitivity of queen bumblebees during the nest initiation phase of the colony cycle, with implications for how queens and their young nests are uniquely impacted by exposure to threats such as pesticide exposure and foraging habitat unsuitability. ¬© 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

101,289,JOUR,Impact of Chronic Neonicotinoid Exposure on Honeybee Colony Performance and Queen Supersedure,"['Sandrock, C', 'Tanadini, M', 'Tanadini, LG', 'Fauser-Misslin, A', 'Potts, SG', 'Neumann, P']",PLOS ONE,"Background: Honeybees provide economically and ecologically vital pollination services to crops and wild plants. During the last decade elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (-28%) and brood (-13%), as well as a reduction in honey production (-29%) and pollen collections (-19%), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: queen supersedure was observed for 60% of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background. Conclusions/Significance: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner. Further, we highlight the importance of the genetic basis of neonicotinoid susceptibility in honeybees which can vary substantially.",2014/08/01/,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0103592,9.0,8,,,1932-6203,WOS:000339819800055,,,,,,,0,,1,10
295,944,JOUR,Assessment of chronic sublethal effects of imidacloprid on honey bee colony health,"['Dively, G.P.', 'Embrey, M.S.', 'Kamel, A.', 'Hawthorne, D.J.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",PLoS ONE,"Here we present results of a three-year study to determine the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on whole honey bee colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 Œºg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 Œºg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 Œºg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 Œºg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 Œºg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. ¬© 2015, Public Library of Science.

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.",2017/08/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-08752-x,7.0,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000407559100005,,,,,,,0,,1,12

Median residues of thiamethoxam in pollen collected from honey bees after foraging on flowering seed treated maize were found to be between 1 and 7 Œºg/kg, median residues of the metabolite CGA322704 (clothianidin) in the pollen were between 1 and 4 Œºg/kg. In oilseed rape, median residues of thiamethoxam found in pollen collected from bees were between <1 and 3.5 Œºg/kg and in nectar from foraging bees were between 0.65 and 2.4 Œºg/kg. Median residues of CGA322704 in pollen and nectar in the oilseed rape trials were all below the limit of quantification (1 Œºg/kg). Residues in the hive were even lower in both the maize and oilseed rape trials, being at or below the level of detection of 1 Œºg/kg for bee bread in the hive and at or below the level of detection of 0.5 Œºg/kg for hive nectar, honey and royal jelly samples. The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring. We conclude that these data demonstrate there is a low risk to honey bees from systemic residues in nectar and pollen following the use of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment on oilseed rape and maize. ¬© 2013 Pilling et al.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0077193,8.0,10,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886064005&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0077193&partnerID=40&md5=08bf230b8449fa8f445dc05138885719,Scopus,,0,,1,13

Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98Œºgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98Œºg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98Œºgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11Œºgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100.0,1,153,158,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892602774&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2013.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=ec4e0e2e11fd0cfd95e2ea6500fb0294,Scopus,,0,,1,14

Colony development was evaluated by monitoring the colony mass, forager activity was assessed, both at the hive and within the crop, and the contribution of oilseed rape to the pollen stored within the colony was analysed. ResultsPollen collected from the treated crop contained residues of 1.0 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and 3.0 mu g CGA322704 (metabolite likely equivalent to clothiandin) kg(-1), and nectar contained residues of 1.8 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and no metabolite. No residues of thiamethoxam or CGA322704 were detected in samples from the control fields. Up to 93% of bumblebee collected pollen sampled from within the colonies originated from oilseed rape, and B. terrestris were observed actively foraging on all the fields. Colonies on all three fields showed similar rates of mass gain during the exposure phase and comparable production of gynes and drones. ConclusionsB. terrestris colonies placed adjacent to a field of flowering oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed developed at a comparable rate with colonies placed adjacent to oilseed rape grown from untreated seed.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 Œºg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10646-012-0927-y,21.0,7,1937,1945,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868128229&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-012-0927-y&partnerID=40&md5=890b4ccf728569521f0bac26b6f3d864,Scopus,,0,,1,16

Bumble bees are important wild pollinators that are widely exposed to dietary neonicotinoids by foraging in agricultural environments. In the laboratory, we tested the effect of a pulsed exposure (14 days 'on dose' followed by 14 days 'off dose') to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on the amount of brood (number of eggs and larvae) produced by Bombus terrestris L. bumble bees in small, standardised experimental colonies (a queen and four adult workers). During the initial 'on dose' period we observed a dose-dependent repression of brood production in colonies, with productivity decreasing as dosage increased up to 98 Œºg kg-1 dietary imidacloprid. During the following 'off dose' period, colonies showed a dose-dependent recuperation such that total brood production during the 28-day pulsed exposure was not correlated with imidacloprid up to 98 Œºg kg-1.

While bees in the field get rarely exposed to lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids applied as seed coating, sublethal levels found in pollen and nectar may affect bee population development. We assessed a realistic and a worst-case scenario of clothianidin exposure to mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) by conducting a small-scale field and semi-field experiment at sites planted with winter oilseed rape. Flight activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were assessed at three locations. We also analysed clothianidin residues in bee-collected pollen and nectar. We detected clothianidin at low concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7¬†¬µg/kg for bumblebees and 4.7¬†¬µg/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10¬†g clothianidin/kg seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population development. However, an impairment of flower visitation under a worst-case scenario may have implications for pollination services and crop production. ¬© 2019, Bundesamt f√ºr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).",2019///,2019,10.1007/s00003-019-01225-5,14.0,3,223,238,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067641041&doi=10.1007%2fs00003-019-01225-5&partnerID=40&md5=b9cc247f444efdff1e2c1173f8187c7a,Scopus,,0,,1,18

Accumulating evidence has shown that pesticides, including neonicotinoids, can have a range of adverse effects on bumble bee health. Most laboratory studies that assess the effects of chronic neonicotinoid exposure on bumble bees use syrup as the delivery vehicle, rather than pollen. However, in the field, it is likely that bumble bees are exposed to neonicotinoids in both nectar (syrup) and pollen. To examine the potential for different effects based on the vehicle, we compared two studies of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in Bombus impatiens microcolonies. We examined correlations between microcolony endpoints and identified associations between the timing of colony pollen and syrup consumption and drone production. Furthermore, in line with previous results, we found that average drone weight was affected at a range of doses only when microcolonies were exposed to acetamiprid via pollen. In general, our analyses point to the importance of the treatment vehicle and suggest that critical effects on developing brood could be missed when neonicotinoid exposure occurs only through syrup.  ¬© 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.",2022///,2022,10.1093/ee/nvac026,51.0,3,613,620,,,"['acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bumble bee', 'drone', 'Hymenoptera', 'microcolony', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'pollinator', 'risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'sublethal']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132453934&doi=10.1093%2fee%2fnvac026&partnerID=40&md5=2728846ff34afcdae226195959cfc3e8,Scopus,,0,,1,19

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls.

During winter, honey bee colonies rely on stored honey and beebread, which is frequently contaminated with the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. To determine whether neonicotinoid exposure affects overwinter survival of Apis mellifera L., we chronically exposed overwintering field colonies and winter workers in the laboratory to thiamethoxam or clothianidin at different concentrations and monitored survival and feed consumption. We also investigated the sublethal effects of chronic thiamethoxam exposure on colony pathogen load, queen quality, and colony temperature regulation. Under field conditions, high doses of thiamethoxam significantly increased overwinter mortality compared to controls, with field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam showing no significant effect on colony overwinter survival. Under laboratory conditions, chronic neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreased survival of winter workers relative to negative control at all doses tested. Chronic high-dose thiamethoxam exposure was not shown to impact pathogen load or queen quality, and field-realistic concentrations of thiamethoxam did not affect colony temperature homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic environmental neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreases survival of winter workers in the laboratory, but only chronic high-dose thiamethoxam significantly decreases overwinter survival of colonies in the field. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

These treatments overlapped the residue levels found in pollen and nectar of many crops and landscape plants, which have higher residue levels than seed-treated crops (less than 10 ppb, corn, canola and sunflower). At 6 weeks, queen mortality was significantly higher in 50 ppb and 100 ppb and by 11 weeks in 20 ppb-100 ppb neonicotinyl-treated colonies. The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37% I, 56% C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears that only a few workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest. The majority of the workers sat immobilized for weeks on the floor of the flight box without moving to fed at sugar syrup feeders. Neonicotinyl residues were lower in wax pots in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided. At 10 (14) ppb I and 50 (39) ppb C, fewer males were produced by the workers, but queens continued to invest in queen production which was similar among treatments. Feeding on imidacloprid and clothianidin can cause changes in behavior (reduced worker movement, consumption, wax pot production, and nectar storage) that result in detrimental effects on colonies (queen survival and colony weight).

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications.

Colonies were evaluated immediately (post-treatment) and 10 weeks (mid-winter) after treatment to compare proximal and latent effects. Post-treatment 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies while 0 ppb colonies more brood than 20 ppb or 100 ppb colonies. Mid-winter 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies and 0 ppb colonies more brood than 100 ppb colonies. Colonies experienced seasonal declines in stored pollen but no treatment effects. Lower 100 ppb colony performance was associated with reduced effort rather than lifespan. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking revealed that workers had similar adult lifespans across treatments; however, 100 ppb workers engaged in activities outside the colony for less time than 0 ppb workers. Imidacloprid exposure affected queen but not worker nutritional physiology. Nurses retained well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (as indicated by head protein) across treatments. Mid-winter queens from 0 ppb colonies had marginally higher ovary protein than queens from 100 ppb colonies and more ovary lipids than queens from 20 ppb colonies.

These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids.

Colonies were sorted into three treatments (60 colonies per treatment) exposed to sunflower blooms grown from seeds treated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin and a non-treated control. Each colony was assessed at six moments: one before to exposition to sunflower, two during the exposition (short-time risk), two after exposition (medium-time risk) and one after wintering (long-time risk).

Most research to date has investigated the role of pesticides on individual honey bees, and it is still unclear how trace levels of pesticides change colony viability and productivity over seasonal time scales. To address this question we exposed standard bee colonies to chemical stressors known to have negative effects on individual bees, and measured the productivity of bee colonies across a whole year in two environments: near Tucson Arizona and Sydney Australia. We exposed hives to a trace amount of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and to the acaricide thymol, and measured capped brood, bee and honey production, as well as the temperature and foraging force of the colonies. The effect of imidacloprid on colony dynamics differed between the two environments. In Tucson we recorded a positive effect of imidacloprid treatment on bee and brood numbers. Thymol was associated with short-term negative effects on bee numbers at both locations, and may have affected colony survival at one location. The overall benefits of thymol for the colonies were unclear. We conclude that long-term and colony-level measures of the effects of agrochemicals are needed to properly understand risks to bees. ¬© 2019",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.402,677.0,,660,670,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065063007&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.04.402&partnerID=40&md5=8dcf9b6ef782cb7cba4e8e9f5eae1bd6,Scopus,,0,,1,28

Residues of clothianidin can occur in nectar and pollen as a result of within-plant-translocation. Foraging bees can collect contaminated nectar or pollen. Concerns have been brought forward that exposure to pesticide residues might affect colonies especially if they are weakened by varroosis. However, there are few scientific studies investigating such multiple-stressor scenarios in the context of the entire colony. To close this gapa field trial with 24 colonies was set up. The study design comprised four groups of six colonies each fed with uncontaminated sugar syrup ('C0'), or syrup spiked with 10 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C10'), 50 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C50') or 200 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C200'). C10 represented a residue concentration that may exceptionally occur and therefore a worst-case scenario, the higher dietary concentrations exceed and do not reflect fieldrealistic levels. A substantial load of 8 mites of Varroa destructor per ten gram bees in autumn was adjusted. The colonies were followed up for 328 days. The amount of brood and the strength of each colony were regularly assessed. Colony health, bee mortality, overwintering success, hive weights, and levels of in-hive residues were determined. Varroosis turned out to be the significant key factor for the endpoint colony strength. Clothianidin did not have a statistically significant impact on C0, C10 and C50 colonies.

Colonies were placed in clothianidin seed-treated or control canola fields during bloom, and thereafter were moved to an apiary with no surrounding crops grown from seeds treated with neonicotinoids. Colony weight gain, honey production, pest incidence, bee mortality, number of adults, and amount of sealed brood were assessed in each colony throughout summer and autumn. Samples of honey, beeswax, pollen, and nectar were regularly collected, and samples were analyzed for clothianidin residues. Several of these endpoints were also measured in spring 2013. Overall, colonies were vigorous during and after the exposure period, and we found no effects of exposure to clothianidin seed-treated canola on any endpoint measures. Bees foraged heavily on the test fields during peak bloom and residue analysis indicated that honey bees were exposed to low levels (0.5-2 ppb) of clothianidin in pollen. Low levels of clothianidin were detected in a few pollen samples collected toward the end of the bloom from control hives, illustrating the difficulty of conducting a perfectly controlled field study with freeranging honey bees in agricultural landscapes. Overwintering success did not differ significantly between treatment and control hives, and was similar to overwintering colony loss rates reported for the winter of 2012-2013 for beekeepers in Ontario and Canada. Our results suggest that exposure to canola grown from seed treated with clothianidin poses low risk to honey bees. ¬© 2014 Cutler et al.",2014///,2014,10.7717/peerj.652,2014.0,1,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84910025943&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.652&partnerID=40&md5=1bce502ffb4585ff4725f7b34e8a7d9f,Scopus,,0,,1,32

There is widespread contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoids, at concentrations which are sublethal for honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus). Objective We compared the effects of chronic, sublethal exposure to the three most commonly used neonicotinoids on honey bee colonies established from New Zealand packaged bees using colony weight gain, brood area, and population size as measures of colony performance. Methods From May 7 to July 29, 2016 (12 weeks), sixty-eight colonies received weekly feedings of sugar syrup and pollen patties containing 0 nM, 20 nM (median environmental dose), or 80 nM (high environmental dose) of one of three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid). Colonies were weighed at three-week intervals. Brood area and population size were determined from digital images of colonies at week 12. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and mixed models. Results There was a significant negative effect (-30%, p<0.01) on colony weight gain (honey production) after 9 and 12 weeks of exposure to 80 nM of thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or imidacloprid and on bee cluster size (-21%, p<0.05) after 12 weeks. Analysis of brood area and number of adult bees lacked adequate (>80%) statistical power to detect an effect. Conclusions Chronic exposure of honey bees to high environmental doses of neonicotinoids has negative effects on honey production. Brood area appears to be less sensitive to detect sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. ¬© 2018 Wood et al.

Besides the exposure to pesticides, colonies are treated frequently with various acaricides that beekeepers are forced to use against the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. Here we have analyzed the impact of chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of the common neonicotinoid thiacloprid (T) and the widely used acaricide œÑ-fluvalinate (synthetic pyrethroid, F) - applied alone or in combination - to honey bee colonies under field conditions. Thiacloprid was administered in sugar syrup at a concentration of 2 mg/kg and in a frequency of 1 kg per week, no pollen was provided in addition. All colonies were kept on an organic farm and they were free to forage. The population dynamics of bees and brood were assessed in all colonies according to the Liebefeld method. Four groups (T, F, F + T, control) with 8-9 colonies each were analyzed in two independent replications, each lasting from spring/summer until spring of the consecutive year. In late autumn, all colonies were treated with oxalic acid against Varroosis. Under these specific conditions and with the doses tested, we could not find a negative impact of the chronic neonicotinoid exposure on the population dynamics or overwintering success of the colonies, irrespective of whether applied alone or in combination with œÑ-fluvalinate. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 International Bee Research Association.",2020///,2020,10.1080/00218839.2019.1675337,59.0,1,2,11,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075386180&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2019.1675337&partnerID=40&md5=c690915e2e2d5199c0fd4bd1fc795a4f,Scopus,,0,,1,34

The drivers for these losses are not fully understood. The influence of pests and pathogens are beyond dispute, but in addition, chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides has been suggested to affect the performance of honey bee colonies. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations (one realistic worst-case concentration) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to honey bee colonies in a three year replicated colony feeding study. RESULTS: Thiacloprid did not significantly affect the colony strength. No differences between treatment and control were observed for the mortality of bees, the infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the infection levels of viruses. No colony losses occurred during the overwintering seasons. Furthermore, thiacloprid did not influence the constitutive expression of the immunity-related hymenoptaecin gene. However, upregulation of hymenoptaecin expression as a response to bacterial challenge was less pronounced in exposed bees than in control bees. CONCLUSION: Under field conditions, bee colonies are not adversely affected by a long-lasting exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid. No indications were found that field-realistic and higher doses exerted a biologically significant effect on colony performance. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

Based on available data (USEPA 2014), this insecticide appears to have a favorable safety profile for honey bee colonies. As a result, the label permits the product to be applied during prebloom and bloom in various crops, including citrus, except when mixed with azole fungicides during the blooming period. We placed 24 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies adjacent to eight flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) fields that either had been sprayed with the maximum label rate of flupyradifurone or with water only (control fields), with three colonies placed adjacent to each field. We conducted colony strength assessments during which the number of adult bees, eggs, uncapped brood cells, capped brood cells, food storage cells, and weights of honey supers and brood chambers were determined prior to, during, and after the flowering period. We also analyzed bee-collected pollen and nectar for flupyradifurone residues. Overall, there were no differences in any colony strength parameter for colonies placed at control and flupyradifurone-treated buckwheat fields. Residue analyses showed that pollen (x = 565.8 ppb) and nectar (x = 259.4 ppb) gathered by bees on fields treated with flupyradifurone contained significantly higher flupyradifurone residues than did bee bread and unprocessed nectar collected by bees from control fields (75% of samples <LOD).

Pathogens and pesticides represent important stressors that influence bumblebee health, both when acting alone or in combination. To better understand bumblebee health, we need to investigate how these factors interact, yet experimental studies to date generally focus on only one or two stressors. The aim of this study is to evaluate how combined effects of four important stressors (the gut parasite Nosema ceranae, the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin and the EBI fungicide tebuconazole) interact to affect bumblebees at the individual and colony levels. We established seven treatment groups of colonies that we pulse exposed to different combinations of these stressors for 2¬†weeks under laboratory conditions. Colonies were subsequently placed in the field for 7¬†weeks to evaluate the effect of treatments on the prevalence of N. ceranae in inoculated bumblebees, expression levels of immunity and detoxification-related genes, food collection, weight gain, worker and male numbers, and production of worker brood and reproductives. Exposure to pesticide mixtures reduced food collection by bumblebees. All immunity-related genes were upregulated in the bumblebees inoculated with N. ceranae when they had not been exposed to pesticide mixtures, and bumblebees exposed to the fungicide and the pyrethroid were less likely to have N. ceranae. Combined exposure to the three-pesticide mixture and N. ceranae reduced bumblebee colony growth, and all treatments had detrimental effects on brood production. The groups exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticide produced 40%‚Äì76% fewer queens than control colonies. Our findings show that exposure to combinations of stressors that bumblebees frequently come into contact with have detrimental effects on colony health and performance and could therefore have an impact at the population level. These results also have significant implications for current practices and policies for pesticide risk assessment and use as the combinations tested here are frequently applied simultaneously in the field. Understanding the interactions between different stressors will be crucial for improving our ability to manage bee populations and for ensuring pollination services into the future. ¬© 2020 British Ecological Society",2021///,2021,10.1111/1365-2656.13375,90.0,2,415,431,,,"['abiotic factor', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'biotic factor', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee health', 'colony performance', 'detoxification', 'environmental stressors', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'male', 'Male', 'Nosema', 'Nosema ceranae', 'pathogen', 'performance assessment', 'pesticide mixtures', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'reproduction', 'Reproduction']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096699765&doi=10.1111%2f1365-2656.13375&partnerID=40&md5=13c171faea3d79dd88c5c16046200a4c,Scopus,,0,,1,38

Only the parent compound and no metabolites were detected in nectar and pollen of these seed-treated sunflower plants (limit of detection <0.001 mg kg-1). In standard LD50 laboratory tests, imidacloprid showed high oral toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera), with LD50 values between 3.7 and 40.9 ng per bee, corresponding to a lethal food concentration between 0.14 and 1.57 mg kg-1.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of imidacloprid in commercial Apis mellifera L. colonies artificially fed with syrups spiked with this insecticide and its possible transfer among in-hive products such as honey and larvae. For this purpose, 30 colonies were placed in the same apiary; once a week for 7¬†weeks in early spring, each colony was fed with 0.5 L of syrup with the following doses of imidacloprid: 0, 15, 30, 120, and 240¬†¬µg¬†kg‚àí1. The colony strength was evaluated by monitoring: the number of adult bees and brood combs, queenlessness, unhealthy colonies (by detection of Nosema spp. spores and European foulbrood), as well as pollen and honey storage. Worker bees, larvae, honey, and beeswax were sampled to evaluate imidacloprid transfer within the hive. Trends in the persistence of the compound showed that up to 60% of the parent (not metabolized) was stored in honey, and the absence of residues in the larvae suggests that they were not exposed. Another result showed a certain impact in the honey reserves and honey yield with a reduction of this resource in the colonies exposed to imidacloprid. ¬© 2023, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s13592-023-00993-2,54.0,2,,,,,"['aphid', 'Apis mellifera L', 'climate change', 'Colony strength', 'dose-response relationship', 'honey', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'pesticide residue', 'Residues', 'spring (season)', 'Sublethal doses', 'sublethal effect']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148884284&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-023-00993-2&partnerID=40&md5=010500999f96964fcab3a6bd75c944fa,Scopus,,0,,1,40

Recently, interactive effects of multiple agrochemicals on bees have been highlighted, including fungicides, which increase toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we use a semi-field study across two seasons in controlled foraging tunnels to test the effects of a field application of a commercial fungicide product with two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin and metconazole) applied at label rates. We also examine its interactive effects with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, at a conservative field-realistic dose of 2.23 ppb, on 48 honey bee colonies. We found combined effects of pesticide exposure, including additive 2.93-fold increases in mortality, and an additional effect of increased infestation levels of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Pesticide treatments also reduced colony activity, reduced colony weight, and increased sugar consumption of whole colonies. These findings indicate that typical sublethal exposure levels to common, co-occurring agrochemicals in the field significantly affect the health of whole honey bee colonies, highlighting an unintended consequence of increasing pesticide applications. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29886,10.0,9,,,,,"['Fungicide', 'Honey bee', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Pesticide', 'Pollinator']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190957678&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2024.e29886&partnerID=40&md5=e6d947082f3cd4336d566c75f9833088,Scopus,,0,,1,41

However, the body distribution of the compound after exposure to neonicotinoids in bumblebees is not well studied. Bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris, n = 20) were exposed to field-realistic concentrations of clothianidin through artificial nectar (3.6-13 mu g/L) for 9 d. Comparison of the nominal with the measured exposure in nectar indicated good compliance, confirming the applicability of the method. When quantified, clothianidin showed a concentration-dependent occurrence in the head and body of workers (head: <0.2-2.17 mu g/kg; body: <0.2-3.17 mu g/kg), and in the body of queens (<0.2-2.49 mu g/kg), although concentrations were below those measured in the nectar (bioaccumulation factor = 0.2). Exposure to clothianidin did not affect mortality nor brood production, nor did it have a statistically significant effect on nectar consumption and size of food storage. However, visual inspection suggests higher nectar consumption of nectar with low clothianidin content compared with nectar with no or high clothianidin content. Our results show that dietary clothianidin is taken up in bumblebees, but does not bioaccumulate to elevated levels compared with exposure. Still, clothianidin may elicit responses that affect feeding behavior of the pollinator B. terrestris, although our endpoints were not significantly affected. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-10.

Additionally, reduced access to forage in agricultural areas creates the potential for risk interactions with these pesticides in regions critical for honey production. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient access to pollen during larval development could mitigate stress associated with oral clothianidin exposure in honey bee adults. An apiary was established where pollen traps deprived half of the colonies of pollen, which was then supplemented to the others. Adults were fed 0, 10, 40, 200, or 400 ¬µg/L clothianidin in the laboratory, and larval and adult lipids and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared between feeding treatments. Survival at sublethal concentrations of clothianidin was significantly reduced for adult bees reared in pollen deprived colonies. Adult SOD activity was affected by clothianidin dose but not larval feeding treatment, though within the pollen-deprived cohort, SOD was greater in controls than those fed clothianidin. Larval SOD differed between field replicates, with supplemented colonies having slightly higher activity levels during a period of pollen dearth, indicating that supplementation during these periods is particularly important for mitigating oxidative stress within the hive. Larval lipids were significantly higher in supplemented colonies during a substantial pollen flow, though adult lipids were unaffected by feeding treatment. These results suggest that during periods of pollen dearth, oxidative stress and adult worker longevity will be improved by supplementing colonies with locally collected pollen. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

Linking our understanding of how pesticides affect individual bees to colony-level responses is challenging because colonies show emergent properties based on complex internal processes and interactions among individual bees. Agent-based models that simulate honey bee colony dynamics may be a tool for scaling between individual and colony effects of a pesticide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are developing the VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide model, which simulates the dynamics of honey bee colonies and how they respond to multiple stressors, including weather, Varroa mites, and pesticides. To evaluate this model, we used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit field data from an empirical study where honey bee colonies were fed the insecticide clothianidin. This allowed us to reproduce colony feeding study data by simulating colony demography and mortality from ingestion of contaminated food. We found that VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide was able to fit general trends in colony population size and structure and reproduce colony declines from increasing clothianidin exposure. The model underestimated adverse effects at low exposure (36¬†¬µg/kg), however, and overestimated recovery at the highest exposure level (140¬†¬µg/kg), for the adult and pupa endpoints, suggesting that mechanisms besides oral toxicity-induced mortality may have played a role in colony declines. The VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide model estimates an adult oral LD50 of 18.9¬†ng/bee (95% CI 10.1‚Äì32.6) based on the simulated feeding study data, which falls just above the 95% confidence intervals of values observed in laboratory toxicology studies on individual bees. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel method for analyzing colony-level data on pesticide effects on bees and making inferences on pesticide toxicity to individual bees. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

We related clothianidin exposure and microbial composition to both individual- and colony-level performance parameters, to better understand the direct and indirect mechanistic effects of neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees. We show that exposure to clothianidin from seed-coated oilseed rape reduces bumblebee size and numbers, particularly of reproductives. However, exposure does not affect the levels of non-pathogenic bacteria or viruses, nor induce rises in the levels or virulence of intracellular parasites.

529,938,JOUR,A field study examining the effects of exposure to neonicotinoid seed-treated corn on commercial bumble bee colonies,"['Christopher Cutler, G.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.']",Ecotoxicology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to bumble bee declines in North America and Europe. This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ‚Äúconventional‚Äù seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1‚Äì0.8¬†ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96¬†¬±¬†15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127¬†¬±¬†17 workers per hive). The results suggest that exposure during pollen shed to corn grown from neonicotinoid-treated shed poses low risk to B. impatiens. ¬© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2014///,2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1340-5,23.0,9,1755,1763,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84909967566&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-014-1340-5&partnerID=40&md5=6c55c1abc68d886cfaf0a7f6c0936e33,Scopus,,0,,1,46

Abrasion of the seed coating generates insecticide-laden planter dust that disperses through the landscape during corn planting and has resulted in many ‚Äúbee-kill‚Äù incidents in North America and Europe. We investigated the linkage between corn planting and honey bee colony success in a region dominated by corn agriculture. Over 3 yr we consistently observed an increased presence of corn seed treatment insecticides in bee-collected pollen and elevated worker bee mortality during corn planting. Residues of seed treatment neonicotinoids, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, detected in pollen positively correlated with cornfield area surrounding the apiaries. Elevated worker mortality was also observed in experimental colonies fed field-collected pollen containing known concentrations of corn seed treatment insecticides. We monitored colony growth throughout the subsequent year in 2015 and found that colonies exposed to higher insecticide concentrations exhibited slower population growth during the month of corn planting but demonstrated more rapid growth in the month following, though this difference may be related to forage availability. Exposure to seed treatment neonicotinoids during corn planting has clear short-term detrimental effects on honey bee colonies and may affect the viability of beekeeping operations that are dependent on maximizing colony size in the springtime.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

This study was motivated by recent massive losses of honey bee colonies, and our objective was to examine the possible relationship between low levels of pesticide residues in apicultural matrices (honey, pollen collected by honey bees, beeswax) and colony health as measured by colony mortality and adult and brood population abundance. When all apicultural matrices were pooled together, the number of pesticide residue detected per sampling period (four sampling periods per year) and per apiary ranged from 0 to 9, with the most frequent being two (29.6%). No pesticide residues were detected during 12.7% of the sampling periods. Residues of imidacloprid and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the most frequently detected in pollen loads, honey, and honey bee matrices. Several pairs of active ingredients were present concurrently within honey bees and in pollen loads but not in beeswax and honey samples. No statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues. When pesticide residues from all matrices were pooled together, a mixed model analysis did not show a significant relationship between the presence of pesticide residues and the abundance of brood and adults, and no statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues.

We assessed the impacts of acetamiprid to the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens using the microcolony model. We examined nest growth, development, and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production.

We found the no-observable‚Äìadverse effect level to be 45.2 ¬µg/kg. Overall, acetamiprid has the potential to negatively impact reproductive endpoints for B. impatiens.

To assess the impact of systemic pesticides in a natural field setting on worker bee behavioral development, observation hives were established to monitor changes in behaviors of similarly aged workers and sister queens within 2 experimental groups: (i) colonies located near point-source systemic pesticide pollution (pesticide contaminated treatment), and (ii) colonies embedded within a typical Midwestern US agricultural environment (control). In this study, worker bees in the contaminated environment exhibited important and biologically significant behavioral differences and accelerated onset of hive tasks (i.e., precocious behavioral development) compared to similarly aged bees at the control site. Queen locomotion was largely unaffected; however, the egg-laying rate was reduced in queens at the contaminated (treated) site. These results show that environmental pesticide exposure can disrupt colony function and adversely affect worker bee behavioral maturation, leading to reduced worker longevity and decreased colony efficiency. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1093/jisesa/ieae034,24.0,3,,,,,"['age polyethism', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'drug effect', 'female', 'Female', 'gene expression', 'growth, development and aging', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'seed treatment', 'toxicology']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194828370&doi=10.1093%2fjisesa%2fieae034&partnerID=40&md5=a0b7054f301b71313b26d316413dfc41,Scopus,,0,,1,52

Although several potential causes have been put forward, the concurrent modification of landscape structure and pesticide use by agriculture are often pointed out as the main drivers of the decline. Yet, the mechanisms through which these factors cause species to decline remain elusive. Most field studies have been conducted at the individual level, and the few studies that addressed higher levels of organization only covered narrow ecological conditions. We undertook a field experiment in spring 2016 to overcome these limitations by placing four commercialBombus impatienscolonies in each of 20 sites located along a gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that landscape habitat composition and configuration, as well as local floral resources, would affect colony development. We expected colonies surrounded by low-intensity and/or flowering crops in heterogeneous landscapes to develop better and live longer, partly linked to more abundant and diversified food resources, than colonies embedded in landscapes dominated by high-intensity crops. Colonies were weighed once a week, and workers were captured to assess pollen load diversity. Final colony weight, queen production, and presence of depredators (Aphomia sociella, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were also recorded. Landscape habitat composition and configuration were characterized within 1 km of colonies. Local availability of floral resources was assessed within 100 m of colonies every two weeks. As predicted, colony weight and longevity decreased with the proportion of intensive crops and increased with the amount of flowering crops, but queen production and the occurrence ofA. sociellawere not affected by landscape composition. Contrary to our prediction, local availability of floral resources also did not affect colonies. The pollen richness brought back to colonies decreased with the proportion of flowering crops and varied according to the proportion of intensive crops interacting with local floral resources. Our work contributes to generalize the more restrictive conclusion of local-scale, crop-specific studies that intensive crop farming undermines bumble bee colony development and that it may thus play a role in the large-scale population decline of these insects.",2020/07//undefined,2020,10.1002/ecs2.3142,11.0,7,,,2150-8925,WOS:000567408500006,"['Aphomia sociella', 'Bumble bees', 'colonies', 'corn crops', 'land cover', 'landscape', 'margins', 'neonicotinoids', 'pollen load', 'queen']",,,,,,0,,1,53

However, current methods for monitoring honeybee foraging activity and mortality are very approximate (visual records) or are time-limited and mostly based on single cohort analysis. We therefore assess the potential of bee counters, that enable a colony-level and continuous monitoring of bee flight activity and mortality, in pesticide risk assessment. After assessing the background activity and bee loss rates, we exposed colonies to two concentrations of sulfoxaflor (a neurotoxic insecticide) in sugar syrup: a concentration that was considered to be field realistic (0.59 Œºg/ml) and a higher concentration (2.36 Œºg/ml) representing a worst-case exposure scenario. We did not find any effect of the field-realistic concentration on flight activity and bee loss rates. However, a two-fold decrease in daily flight activity and a 10-fold increase in daily bee losses were detected in colonies exposed to the highest sulfoxaflor concentration as compared to before exposure. When compared to the theoretical trigger values associated with the specific protection goal of 7 % colony-size reduction, the observed fold changes in daily bee losses were often found to be at risk for colonies. In conclusion, the real-time and colony-level monitoring of bee loss rates, combined with threshold values indicating at which levels bee loss rates threaten the colony, have great potential for improving regulatory pesticide risk assessments for honeybees under field conditions. ¬© 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163928,886.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee counter', 'Bees', 'chemical pollutant', 'colony', 'daily life activity', 'field study', 'Flight activity', 'Foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee colonies', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Loss rates', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'Mortality rate', 'Mortality rates', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'Population statistics', 'Protection goals', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'real time', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Specific protection goal', 'sucrose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'toxin', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158044301&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163928&partnerID=40&md5=a069348fa254c4e8d76ca126a1d9d753,Scopus,,0,,1,54

Pesticides and parasites are often cited as two of the drivers of bee declines, particularly as they have previously been found to interact with one another to the detriment of bee health. Here we test the effects of an insecticide, sulfoxaflor, and a highly prevalent bumble bee parasite, Crithidia bombi, on the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. After exposing colonies to realistic doses of either sulfoxaflor and/or Crithidia bombi in a fully crossed experiment, colonies were allowed to forage on field beans in outdoor exclusion cages. Foraging performance was monitored, and the impacts on fruit set were recorded. We found no effect of either stressor, or their interaction, on the pollination services they provide to field beans, either at an individual level or a whole colony level. Further, there was no impact of any treatment, in any metric, on colony development.

Trade-offs between longevity and other traits may render long-living workers in brood-free periods more susceptible to pesticides compared to short-lived ones. Further, colony environment (e.g., adequate nutrition) may enable workers to better cope with pesticides, yet data comparing long vs. short-living workers and the role of the colony environment for pesticide tolerance are scarce. Here, we show that long-living honey bee workers, Apis mellifera, are less susceptible to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam than short-lived workers, and that susceptibility was further reduced when workers were acclimatized under colony compared to laboratory conditions. Following an OECD protocol, freshly-emerged workers were exposed to thiamethoxam in summer and winter and either acclimatized within their colony or in the laboratory. Mortality and sucrose consumption were measured daily and revealed that winter workers were significantly less susceptible than summer workers, despite being exposed to higher thiamethoxam dosages due to increased food consumption. Disparencies in fat body activity, which is key for detoxification, may explain why winter bees were less susceptible. Furthermore, colony acclimatization significantly reduced susceptibility towards thiamethoxam in winter workers likely due to enhanced protein nutrition. Brood absence and colony environment seem to govern workers‚Äô ability to cope with pesticides, which should be considered in risk assessments. Since honey bee colony losses occur mostly over winter, long-term studies assessing the effects of pesticide exposure on winter bees are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02758-8,33.0,6,608,621,,,"['acclimation', 'acclimatization', 'Acclimatization', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behaviour', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'Eusociality', 'fat pad', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'insecticide resistance', 'Insecticides', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'OECD', 'organism colony', 'physiology', 'protein intake', 'risk assessment', 'season', 'Seasons', 'sucrose', 'sugar intake', 'summer', 'survival', 'Survival', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'winter', 'worker (insect)']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193948446&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-024-02758-8&partnerID=40&md5=7503c10cfc68fdbc939e99db2b0deb24,Scopus,,0,,1,56

Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171¬±44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees. ¬© 2013 Larson et al.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0066375,8.0,6,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878950172&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0066375&partnerID=40&md5=511c3eab7690065851b8a5dc26bb8eea,Scopus,,0,,1,57

In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness).

Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time.

We assessed the impact of exposure to these two pesticides individually and in combination, at a range of field-realistic doses. In laboratory assays, mortality of larvae treated with captan was 80‚Äì90% greater than controls, dose-independent, and similar to mortality from the lowest dose of thiamethoxam. There was evidence of synergism (i.e., a non-additive response) from captan-thiamethoxam co-exposure at the highest dose of thiamethoxam, but not at lower doses. In the field, we exposed whole colonies to the lowest doses used in the laboratory. Exposure to captan and thiamethoxam individually and in combination resulted in minimal impacts on population growth or colony mortality, and there was no evidence of synergism or antagonism. These results suggest captan and thiamethoxam are each acutely toxic to immature honey bees, but whole colonies can potentially compensate for detrimental effects, at least at the low doses used in our field trial, or that methodological differences of the field experiment impacted results (e.g., dilution of treatments with natural pollen). If compensation occurred, further work is needed to assess how it occurred, potentially via increased queen egg laying, and whether short-term compensation leads to long-term costs.

No additive effects of simultaneous exposure of worker adults or brood to thiamethoxam and prothioconazole were observed. At day 8 and day 12, the hypopharyngeal gland acinar diameter was not significantly different (P¬†> 0.05) between controls and adult workers exposed to thiamethoxam and/or prothioconazole. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that chronic exposure to field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam and/or prothioconazole are unlikely to affect the survival of adult workers and brood. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2020///,2020,10.1002/ps.5501,76.0,1,85,94,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076325398&doi=10.1002%2fps.5501&partnerID=40&md5=11fa8fc1781748010c81353c96b3c17b,Scopus,,0,,1,65

Recently, many Japanese beekeepers have implied that midsummer use of a new insecticide, neonicotinoid, in rice fields, is causing widespread mortality of neighboring honeybees and frequently resulting in colony collapse. Since few field experiments have directly tested the effects of neonicotinoids, I addressed four research questions in the field. The questions are: 1) Does clothianidin application in rice fields cause the collapse of neighboring honeybee colonies? 2) Is colony collapse related to hive distance from the rice field? 3) Is the number of dead honeybee workers after spraying, related to hive distance from the field? 4) What are the long-term effects of neonicotinoid use on honeybee colony growth, especially brood production? In the late summer of 2010, honeybee hives were placed adjacent to two separate rice fields for 1 week. The hives were placed at the distance of 0, 30, 60, and 90 m. After spraying clothianidin, a daily count of dead worker honeybees was done for a week. Hives were weighed, and capped-brood areas were estimated weekly, for 2 months following insecticide application. Although the average number of dead workers ranged from 40 to over 100 within 24 hours after spraying, only a few dead workers were observed in the subsequent days. Distance from the rice field had no significant effect on the number of dead workers. There were no collapsed colonies during the 2-month, post-spray observation period. Hive weight and capped-brood area did not significantly differ among those hives placed at varying distances from the rice field. These results indicated that clothianidin spraying of the rice field increased the mortality of the honeybees, but did not always cause colony collapse.",2013///,2013,10.2478/JAS-2013-0014,57.0,2,21,35,1643-4439,WOS:000328723400002,,,,,,,0,,1,66
283,710,JOUR,"Comparison of long-term changes in size and longevity of bee colonies in mid-west Japan and Maui with and without exposure to pesticide, cold winters, and mites","['Yamada, T.', 'Yamada, K.']",PeerJ,"Four long-term field experiments in mid-west Japan (Shika) made it clear that extinction of colonies exposed to neonicotinoid was much higher than for colonies exposed to organophosphates. The incidence of hive death for of organophosphate-exposed and control (pesticide-free) colonies was similar. We conducted a field experiment in Maui for 271 days using the same pesticides (dinotefuran: 0.2 ppm, clothianidin: 0.08 ppm, fenitrothion: 1 ppm) as used in Shika with the honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies without mites. Numbers of adult bees, capped brood, mites and other hive parameters were accurately counted on photographs of combs and on the inside of the hives. All six neonicotinoid (dinotefuran & clothianidin)-exposed colonies failed during the experiment. One of three organophosphate (fenitrothion)-exposed colonies and one of the three control colonies also failed. The findings from Maui, where colonies displayed no mites, provides evidence from Shika, with mites, that neonicotinoids are more hazardous to honeybee colonies than organophosphates. The apparent longevity of honeybee colonies on Maui was estimated by numbers of adult bees and capped brood using a mathematical model previously proposed. Seasonal changes in longevity on Maui differ greatly from changes at Shika, the latter showing distinct seasonal variation. Longevity on Maui remains nearly constant throughout the year with wide variations. At Shika, it increases drastically in winter, by six- to ten fold more than the other seasons. Differences seem to depend on the existence of cold winters and the length of flowering seasons. In a perpetually hospitable environment, small changes in conditions can be sensitively reflected in apparent longevity. Examining wide variations in apparent longevity that are seemingly incoherent, we recognized several differences in apparent longevity between neonicotinoidexposed and organophosphate-exposed colonies: The colony that failed in after organophosphate-exposure colony group exhibited the longest apparent longevity and the fewest number of newly capped brood, as also was the case in control colonies. Extended longevity when few brood are newly produced is reasonable to maintain the colony from a physiological point of view. Extension of apparent longevity is not seen in neonicotinoid-exposed colonies when the number of newly capped brood is fewer. This finding suggests that neonicotinoid pesticides may inhibit normal apian physiology. ¬© Copyright 2020 Yamada and Yamada.",2020///,2020,10.7717/peerj.9505,8.0,,,,,,"['adult', 'Article', 'clothianidin', 'Clothianidin', 'cold', 'colony collapse', 'Colony size', 'comparative study', 'dinotefuran', 'Dinotefuran', 'fenitrothion', 'Fenitrothion', 'field experiment', 'Field experiment', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee', 'hospital', 'incidence', 'insecticidal activity', 'long term exposure', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical phenomena', 'Maui', 'mite', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'nonhuman', 'organophosphate', 'Organophosphate', 'pesticide', 'seasonal variation', 'seed yield', 'winter']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090275050&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.9505&partnerID=40&md5=6bb2b7ffaf2943243bb54bca46078721,Scopus,,0,,1,67

There is no single cause for the colony losses, but many contributing stressors may act in concert. Varroa destructor infestation is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses. The roles of infestation by Nosema ceranae or exposure to insecticides are controversial. Interactions between exposure to pesticides and V.¬†destructor or Nosema spp. have previously been implicated. In two years of field experiments, we studied the effects of and possible interactions between the stressors V.¬†destructor infestation, Nosema spp. infestation, and chronic sublethal exposure to a field-realistic dose of the insecticide imidacloprid on the performance and survival of honey bee colonies. Colonies highly infested by V.¬†destructor were 13% smaller in size and were 59.1 times more likely to die than colonies infested with low levels of V.¬†destructor. Infestation with high levels of Nosema sp. led to 2% decrease in size and 1.4 times higher likelihood to die compared to colonies with low levels of Nosema sp. No effects of chronic sublethal exposure to imidacloprid on colony size or survival were found in this study. Exposure to V.¬†destructor and imidacloprid led to a slightly higher fraction of bees infested with Nosema sp., but in contrast to the expectations, no resulting interactions were found for colony size or survival. Colonies as a superorganism may well be able to compensate at the colony level for sublethal negative effects of stressors on their individuals. In our experimental study under field-realistic exposure to stressors, V.¬†destructor was by far the most lethal one for honey bee colonies. ¬© 2018 The Authors.",2018///,2018,10.1002/ecs2.2378,9.0,8,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054066040&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2378&partnerID=40&md5=39e737a647cd9bc5bf43479efad421aa,Scopus,,0,,1,68

Brood index, compensation index, and brood termination rate were calculated for the brood area (2 sq. inch) selected at two time intervals i.e. at the time of spray (D0) and seven days after that (D7). Brood index for the brood selected at D7 of thiamethoxam applied at 25 g a.i. ha‚àí1 was statistically at par with the untreated control i.e. its value at 21 days (1.00 ¬± 0.00-4.48 ¬± 0.04) was statistically at par with the untreated control (1.00 ¬± 0.00-4.66 ¬± 0.01).

Here, we controlled honey bee colony exposure to field-relevant concentrations of 2 neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) in pollen and simultaneously manipulated intracolony genetic heterogeneity. We showed that exposure increased rates of Varroa destructor (Anderson and Trueman) parasitism and that while increased genetic heterogeneity overall improved survivability, it did not reduce the negative effect size of neonicotinoid exposure.

Results: Due to the weather conditions in the first experiment guttation occurred only once, which caused a high mortality and a brood-termination rate of up to 100 % in the worst-case scenario without additional water supply but no clear increase of mortality or brood termination was observed when water was supplied. In the second experiment guttation in maize occurred on 5 of 10 days. The mortality in treated variants with water supply and control variants with untreated seeds was on a similar level and within normal range. The brood-termination rate was in the control below 16 %, in the treatment from 16 to 43 %.

In recent years, neonicotinoids are widely used against a broad spectrum sucking pests. However, they also pose a major threat to the beekeeping industry. The present study aimed to quantify the impact of thiamethoxam, a second-generation, broad-spectrum neonicotinoid on foraging behavior, colony performance, and survival of Apis mellifera L. in mustard crop under semi-field (cage) and field conditions. Under semi-field conditions, the foraging activity of A. mellifera on mustard bloom reduced significantly on the 2nd day after spray of thiamethoxam as compared to pre-count and control. Significant decrease in brood area (7th to 21st day), nectar stores (7th to 28th day), and pollen stores (7th to 21st day) were also recorded after the spray. The bee mortality under semi-field conditions was significantly higher on the 1st and 2nd day after spray in comparison to control. Under field conditions, average bee activity remained statistically low up to the 12th day after spray on mustard bloom in comparison to pre-count and control. The effect of thiamethoxam under field conditions was less pronounced for bee mortality and colony parameters.

However, by altering behavioural or physiological responses of insects, extreme heat events may also affect pollination services on which many crops are dependent. Such effects may potentially be exacerbated by other environmental stresses, such as exposure to widely used agro-chemicals. To determine whether environmental stressors interact to affect pollination services, we carried out field cage experiments on the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris). Using a Bayesian approach, we assessed whether heat stress (colonies maintained at an ambient temperature of 25‚ó¶C or 31‚ó¶C) and insecticide exposure (5 ng g‚Äì1 of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin) could induce behavioural changes that affected pollination of faba bean (Vicia faba). Only the bumble bee colonies and not the plants were exposed to the environmental stress treatments. Bean plants exposed to heat-stressed bumble bee colonies (31‚ó¶C) had a lower proportional pod set compared to colonies maintained at 25‚ó¶C. There was also weak evidence that heat stressed colonies caused lower total bean weight. Bee exposure to clothianidin was found to have no clear effect on plant yields, either individually or as part of an interaction. We identified no effect of either colony stressor on bumble bee foraging behaviours. Our results suggest that extreme heat stress at the colony level may impact on pollination services. However, as the effect for other key yield parameters was weaker (e.g., bean yields), our results are not conclusive. Overall, our study highlights the need for further research on how environmental stress affects behavioural interactions in plant-pollinator systems that could impact on crop yields. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

Based on model outcomes, fields with higher levels of soil neonicotinoids exhibited significantly lower wild bee abundance and diversity than those with low or no neonicotinoids detected. Crop soil neonicotinoid level, hedgerow floral resource abundance and crop type were consistent predictors of bee abundance across models; only neonicotinoid level and crop type were significant predictors of diversity.

Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides globally(3), but increasing evidence of negative impacts on important pollinators(4-9) and other non-target organisms(10) has led to legislative reassessment and created demand for the development of alternative products. Sulfoximine-based insecticides are the most likely successor(11), and are either licensed for use or under consideration for licensing in several worldwide markets(3), including within the European Union(12), where certain neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam) are now banned from agricultural use outside of permanent greenhouse structures. There is an urgent need to pre-emptively evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of sulfoximine-based pesticides on pollinators(11), because such effects are rarely detected by standard ecotoxicological assessments, but can have major impacts at larger ecological scales(13-15). Here we show that chronic exposure to the sulfoximine-based insecticide sulfoxaflor, at dosages consistent with potential post-spray field exposure, has severe sub-lethal effects on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. Field-based colonies that were exposed to sulfoxaflor during the early growth phase produced significantly fewer workers than unexposed controls, and ultimately produced fewer reproductive offspring. Differences between the life-history trajectories of treated and control colonies first became apparent when individuals exposed as larvae began to emerge, suggesting that direct or indirect effects on a small cohort may have cumulative long-term consequences for colony fitness. Our results caution against the use of sulfoximines as a direct replacement for neonicotinoids.

Colonies grew heavier near thiacloprid-treated clover compared to controls lacking clover, while colonies near untreated clover did not differ from colonies in neither of the other landscape types. Thiacloprid treatment effectively controlled pests and increased bumblebee crop visitation. However, colony production of queens and males did not differ among landscape types.

Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields.

Analyses of large-scale datasets to investigate the real-world links between the use of neonicotinoids and pollinator mortality are lacking. Moreover, the impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony losses over an 11 year period, and reveal a correlation between honey bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may derive an economic return.

1,10,JOUR,Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure,"['Gill, RJ', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""fec12292-list-0001""> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",2014/12//undefined,2014,10.1111/1365-2435.12292,28.0,6,1459,1471,0269-8463,WOS:000344592000015,,,,,,,0,,1,80

Its flowers constitute important sources for bees and beekeepers take advantage of this and keep their honey bee colonies within or near the plantations for honey production. Nonetheless, these plantations are susceptible to pests, such as the eucalyptus weevil Gonipterus platensis. To control this weevil, some plantations must be treated with pesticides, which might harm non-target organisms. This study aimed to perform a multifactorial assessment of the health status and development of Apis mellifera iberiensis colonies in two similar landscape windows dominated by Eucalyptus globulus plantations - one used as control and the other with insecticide treatment. In each of the two selected areas, an apiary with five hives was installed and monitored before and after a single application of the insecticide acetamiprid (40 g a.i./ha). Colony health and development, resources use, and pesticide residues accumulation were measured. The results showed that the application of acetamiprid in this area did not alter the health status and development of the colonies. This can be explained by the low levels of residues of acetamiprid detected only in pollen and bee bread samples, ~52 fold lower than the sublethal effect threshold. This could be attributed to the low offer of resources during and after the application event and within the application area, with the consequent foraging outside the sprayed area during that period. Since exposure to pesticides in such complex landscapes seems to be dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources, we highlight some key monitoring parameters and tools that are able to provide reliable information on colony development and use of resources. These tools can be easily applied and can provide a better decision-taking of pesticide application in intensive production systems to decrease the risk of exposure for honey bees. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157030,844.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apis mellifera iberiensis', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bioaccumulation', 'controlled study', 'decision making', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental monitoring', 'Eucalyptus', 'Eucalyptus globulus', 'Field exposure', 'Food products', 'foraging', 'Health', 'Health status', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'landscape', 'Landscape management', 'monoculture', 'Monoculture plantations', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'nontarget organism', 'organism colony', 'pest control', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticides', 'plantation', 'pollen', 'Portugal', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'sublethal effect']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133702532&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157030&partnerID=40&md5=ed6ae1e835fcbede6033369b95c264c8,Scopus,,0,,1,81
3,879,JOUR,A demographic approach to evaluating the impact of stressors on bumble bee colonies,"['Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecological Entomology,"1. Natural and anthropogenic stressors threaten the sustainability of bumble bees and evaluating their impact is essential to the stewardship of these valuable pollinators. Demographic modelling provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the impacts of stressors, but it has not previously been applied to bumble bees. 2. I therefore formulated a demographic model for a bumble bee colony and then quantified the impact of two stressors, pesticide exposure and spider predation, by perturbing it with their known effects. 3. By simulating a laboratory exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to dietary imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide), I tested whether the observed colony decline was explained solely by a toxic effect on the fecundity of the foundress queen. By simulating field observations of B. terricola Kirby, I tested whether predation by crab spiders reduced colony fitness sufficiently to provide an adaptive explanation for avoidance behaviours seen when bumble bees encounter spiders. 4. In B. terrestris, a dose-appropriate decrease in fecundity predicted the observed colony decline, which implicates this as a principal mechanism of toxicity. In B. terricola, doubling the rate of spider predation reduced a colony's production of new queens by 11%, which implies that spider avoidance is highly adaptive. 5. These analyses illustrate the utility of demographic modelling for quantifying the impacts of stressors on bumble bees. In the future, models of this type could be used to investigate a wider range of stressors and to produce thereby knowledge and tools useful for safeguarding bumble bees and the pollination services that they provide. ¬© 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",2017///,2017,10.1111/een.12376,42.0,2,221,229,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010338968&doi=10.1111%2feen.12376&partnerID=40&md5=fcbfe7fdce13098497b692b2d9f99794,Scopus,,0,,1,82

While these factors have been well studied individually, the experimental designs do not reflect real-world conditions where insecticide exposure and lack of forage occur simultaneously and could interactively suppress pollinator health. Using outdoor enclosures, we tested the effects of insecticides (imidacloprid + lambda-cyhalothrin) and non-crop forage (clover) in a factorial design, measuring the survival, behaviour and performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), as well as pollination of the focal crop, watermelon. Colony survival was synergistically reduced to 17% in watermelon alone + insecticides (survival was 100% in all other treatments). However, behavioural shifts in foraging were mainly owing to insecticides (e.g. 95% reduced visitation rate to watermelon flowers), while impacts on hive performance were primarily driven by clover presence (e.g. 374% increase in the number of live eggs). Insecticide-mediated reductions in foraging decreased crop pollination (fruit set) by 32%. Altogether, these data indicate that both insecticides and non-crop forage play integral roles in shaping pollinator health in agricultural landscapes, but the relative importance and interaction of these two factors depend on which aspect of 'health' is being considered.  ¬© 2021 The Authors.",2021///,2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.0785,288.0,1953,,,,,"['agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'agroecosystem', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus impatiens', 'Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus', 'crop pollination', 'flower', 'Flowers', 'food supplementation', 'forage', 'fruit', 'Fruit', 'herbicide', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator health', 'Trifolium']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109830790&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2021.0785&partnerID=40&md5=1e004e9d41f308859ab0f430b6b7fdd4,Scopus,,0,,1,83

A suspension of 22% sulfoxaflor concentration was applied on cucumber at full bloom, at the rates of 75 g a.i./ha and 100 g a.i./ha, both with 2 applications at 6-day interval. Colonies were introduced into the tunnels one day after the first application, then mortality and behaviour of the test bees were observed and recorded every day. Cucumber flowers were taken and analysed for sulfoxaflor residues. The second application occurred 6 days later, then, observations of mortality and behaviour were conducted for 5 days, and then the colonies were removed from the tunnels and transported back to the apiary for 14 days additional observation. Besides, general conditions of the colonies were assessed before and after exposure, at the end of the field study. After being introduced into the tunnels, the colonies stabilized after 3 days‚Äô adaption. During the exposure period, sulfoxaflor showed lethal toxicity on bees, but the effect was less than that caused by dimethoate. After being removed from the tunnels, the mortalities of all groups fluctuated at a low level, indicating that sulfoxaflor had no long-term lethal effect on bees. During the whole exposure period, sulfoxaflor had no effect on the flight intensity of the bees. Meanwhile, sulfoxaflor had no obvious adverse effect on the strength and the condition of the test colonies. Residue analysis showed that: on the days of application, the residue of sulfoxaflor in cucumber flower was between 5.004 mg/kg and 5.832 mg/kg. After the applications, the residue of sulfoxaflor reduced gradually, until the 6th day after the first application, the residue reduced to 0.100~0.198 mg/kg, until the 5th day after the second application, the residue reduced to 0.155~0.304 mg/kg. ¬© 2018, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

We examined for the first time the multidimensional effects of field-realistic concentrations of two common neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) on drone honeybee survival, behaviour and physiology using individuals reared and maintained as adults in the field. Our data showed that neonicotinoids reduced honeybee drone survival by 51%, increased drifting behaviour to non-maternal colonies by 100%, delayed flight activities by 3¬†days and reduced number of living sperm by 28%. However, they did not influence the sperm concentration produced by the drones, the strength of the drone's maternal colonies or the total number of drones produced by those colonies.

184,608,JOUR,Bumblebees Exposed to a Neonicotinoid Pesticide Make Suboptimal Foraging Decisions,"['Siviter, H.', 'Johnson, A.K.', 'Muth, F.']",Environmental Entomology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers, but many species are in decline. Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide globally and can have negative sublethal effects on bumblebee colony growth and reproduction. Individual bumblebees can visit hundreds to thousands of flowers a day to forage for their colony. As such, they are a model species for studying optimal foraging, and small impairments to an individual's foraging decisions may have compounding effects on the colony's nutritional intake. We exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, before allowing them to forage on an artificial floral array. We found that neonicotinoid-exposed bumblebees made suboptimal foraging decisions, as they were more likely to visit flowers located further apart than control bees. This indicates that for a given flower patch, individual bees exposed to a neonicotinoid will likely use more energy and forage less efficiency than unexposed bees, although further studies that directly measure energetic cost are required to confirm this. Given the robust and growing body of evidence demonstrating negative sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees, sublethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory within the regulatory process.  ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

Our results indicate that for O. bicornis (1) the risk of adverse impacts of sulfoxaflor (Closer) on fitness is small when applied at least five days before crop flowering and (2) that azoxystrobin (Amistar) has a low potential of exacerbating sulfoxaflor effects under field-realistic conditions. ¬© 2022 The Author(s)",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107252,164.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'Azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body size', 'cocoon', 'concentration (composition)', 'crop', 'Crops', 'Europe', 'experimental study', 'female', 'Female', 'field experiment', 'Field experiment', 'flowering', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'Mitigation measures', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicorni', 'Osmia bicornis', 'parasitism', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'pollution exposure', 'Pre-flowering', 'predation', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Regulatory authorities', 'risk assessment', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85129458997&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2022.107252&partnerID=40&md5=3eefd1fa0cdf96479b15e97597220760,Scopus,,0,,1,87

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 ¬µg/ml to 5 and 1 ¬µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage.

21,623,JOUR,Sulfoxaflor and nutritional deficiency synergistically reduce survival and fecundity in bumblebees,"['Linguadoca, A.', 'Rizzi, C.', 'Villa, S.', 'Brown, M.J.F.']",Science of the Total Environment,"A range of anthropogenic factors are causing unprecedented bee declines. Among these drivers the usage of pesticides is believed to be crucial. While the use of key bee-harming insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, has been reduced by regulatory authorities, novel, less studied substances have occupied their market niche. Understanding the threat of these chemicals to bees is, therefore, crucial to their conservation. Here we focus on sulfoxaflor, a novel insecticide, targeting the same neural receptor as the neonicotinoids. In stark contrast to the growing concerns around its negative impacts on bee health, a recent assessment has resulted in the extension of its authorisations across the USA. However, such assessments may underestimate risks by overlooking interactive impacts of multiple stressors. Here we investigated co-occurring, lethal and sublethal risks of sulfoxaflor and a dietary stress for bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), a key pollinator. Specifically, we employed a novel microcolony design, where, for the first time in bees, pesticide exposure mimicked natural degradation. We orally exposed workers to sulfoxaflor and a sugar-deficient diet in a fully factorial design. Field realistic, worst-case sulfoxaflor exposure caused a sharp increase in bee mortality. At sublethal concentrations, sulfoxaflor negatively affected bee fecundity, but not survival. Nutritional stress reduced bee fecundity and synergistically or additively aggravated impacts of sulfoxaflor on bee survival, egg laying and larval production. Our data show that non-mitigated label uses of sulfoxaflor may have major, yet severely neglected effects on bumblebee health, which may be exacerbated by nutritional stress. By unravelling mechanistic interactions of synergistic risks, our study highlights the need to overcome inherent limitations of Environmental Risk Assessment schemes, which, being based on a ‚Äúsingle stressor paradigm‚Äù, may fail to inform policymakers of the real risks of pesticide use. ¬© 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148680,795.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Anthropogenic factors', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus terrestris', 'Bumblebee', 'colony', 'degradation', 'Degradation', 'fecundity', 'fertility', 'Fertility', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'malnutrition', 'Malnutrition', 'Market niche', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'Multiple stressors', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nutrition', 'Nutrition', 'Nutritional stress', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Regulatory authorities', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'United States']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109426130&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.148680&partnerID=40&md5=829e5f6e6568702aba4efc80270da5c7,Scopus,,0,,1,89

These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality.

In each site, three locations were directly adjacent to OSR fields, three locations were situated 400 m apart from the nearest OSR field. The development of colonies was monitored from the begin of OSR blossom in April until June 2014. Pollen from returning foragers was analysed for its composition and residue content. At the end of OSR blossom hives were removed from the study sites and eventually dissected assessing young queens as well as the undeveloped queen brood cells. An average of 44% of OSR pollen was found in the pollen loads of bumblebees indicating that 0513 was a major resource for the colonies. Colony development in terms of hive weight and the number of workers showed a typical course no statistically significant differences were found between the sites. Reproductive output (young queens and queen brood) cells was comparatively high and not negatively affected by the exposure to treated OSR. In summary, Elado (R)-dressed OSR did not cause any detrimental effects on the development or reproduction of bumblebee colonies.",2018///,2018,10.5073/jka.2018.462.054,462.0,,180,180,1868-9892,WOS:000457670000056,,,"['Oomen, PA', 'Pistorius, J']",,,,0,,1,91

Nonetheless, bees remain exposed to many pesticides whose effects are poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that one of the most prominent replacements of the banned neonicotinoids ‚Äì the insecticide sulfoxaflor - harms bees and that fungicides may have been overlooked as a driver of bee declines. Realistic-exposure studies are, however, lacking. Here, we assess the impact of the insecticide Closer (active ingredient: sulfoxaflor) and the widely used fungicide Amistar (a.i.: azoxystrobin) on honeybees in a semi-field study (10 flight cages containing a honeybee colony, for each of three treatments: Closer, Amistar, control). The products were applied according to label instructions either before (Closer) or during (Amistar) the bloom of purple tansy. We found no significant effects of Closer or Amistar on honeybee colony development or foraging activity. Our study suggests that these pesticides pose no notable risk to honeybees when applied in isolation, following stringent label instructions. The findings on Closer indicate that a safety-period of 5‚Äì6 days between application and bloom, which is only prescribed in a few EU member states, may prevent its impacts on honeybees. However, to conclude whether Closer and Amistar can safely be applied, further realistic-exposure studies should examine their effects in combination with other chemical or biological stressors on various pollinator species. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146084,778.0,,,,,,"['Amistar', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'Azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bee stressor', 'Bee stressors', 'Bees', 'Blooms (metal)', 'Close', 'Closer', 'controlled study', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental impact', 'European union', 'experimental study', 'Field experiment', 'foraging', 'Foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee colonies', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'isolation', 'landscape', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'Phacelia tanacetifolia', 'plant', 'pollution exposure', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'Pyrimidines', 'safety', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102295472&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.146084&partnerID=40&md5=d260051198325bc62b077046b2bb7c7a,Scopus,,0,,1,92

For the most part, exposure to these pesticide mixtures does not result in acute lethal effects, but we know very little about potential sublethal effects and their consequences on reproductive success and population dynamics. In this study, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia cornuta to environmentally-relevant levels of acetamiprid (a cyano-substituted neonicotinoid insecticide) singly and in combination with tebuconazole (a sterol-biosynthesis inhibitor (SBI) fungicide). The amount of feeding solution consumed during the exposure phase was lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Following exposure, females were individually marked and released into oilseed rape field cages to monitor their nesting performance and assess their reproductive success. The nesting performance and reproductive success of bees exposed to the fungicide or the insecticide alone were similar to those of control bees and resulted in a 1.3‚Äì1.7 net population increases. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed lower establishment, shortened nesting period, and reduced fecundity. Together, these effects led to a 0.5‚Äì0.6 population decrease. Female establishment and shortened nesting period were the main population bottlenecks. We found no effects of the pesticide mixture on nest provisioning rate, offspring body weight or sex ratio. Our study shows how sublethal pesticide exposure may affect several components of bee reproductive success and, ultimately, population growth.

Pesticides and the loss of food resources from flowering plants are two stressors known to act together to impair bee fitness. The impact of these stressors on key behaviors like foraging and nesting can limit pollination services and population persistence, making it critical to understand these sublethal effects. We investigated the effects of insecticide exposure and floral resource limitation on the foraging and nesting behavior of the solitary blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in field cages foraged on wildflowers at high or low densities, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design. Both stressors influenced behavior, but they had differential impacts. Bees with limited food resources made fewer, but longer foraging trips and misidentified their nests more often. Insecticide exposure reduced bee foraging activity. Additionally, insecticides interacted with bee age to influence antagonistic behavior among neighboring females, such that insecticide-exposed bees were less antagonistic with age. Our findings point towards mechanisms underlying effects on populations and ecosystem function and reinforce the importance of studying multiple drivers to understand the consequences of anthropogenic change. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161392,867.0,,,,,,"['adult', 'age distribution', 'agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee pollination', 'Bees', 'controlled study', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystems', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental impact', 'environmental protection', 'environmental stress', 'female', 'Female', 'fitness', 'flower', 'Flower resource', 'Flower resources', 'Flowering plants', 'food processing', 'Food resources', 'foraging behavior', 'human impact (environment)', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'male', 'Natural ecosystem', 'negative reinforcement', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nesting', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'Population persistences', 'population structure', 'Resource limitations', 'social behavior', 'Stressor', 'Stressors', 'sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146048930&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.161392&partnerID=40&md5=17302dd2e032643e38416c63ee8e913d,Scopus,,0,,1,97

Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to their decline, but the increasing use of neonicotinoid insecticides has recently emerged as particularly concerning. In this study, honey bees were exposed orally to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the field in order to assess its effects on the foraging behavior, homing success, and dance communication. The foraging span and foraging activity at the contaminated feeder decreased significantly due to chronic exposure at field-realistic concentrations. Electrostatic field of dancing bees was measured and it was revealed that the number of waggle runs, the fanning time and the number of stop signals were significantly lower in the exposed colony. No difference was found in the homing success and the flight duration between control and treated bees released at a novel location within the explored area. However, a negative effect of the ambient temperature, and an influence of the location of the trained feeder was found. Finally, the residues of clothianidin accumulated in the abdomens of exposed foraging bees over time.

Previous research has demonstrated that honey bees display adverse behavioral and cognitive effects after treatment with sublethal doses of neonicotinoids. In laboratory studies, honey bees simultaneously increase their proportional intake of neonicotinoid-treated solutions and decrease their total solution consumption to some concentrations of certain neonicotinoids. These findings suggest that neonicotinoids might elicit a suboptimal response in honey bees, in which they forage preferentially on foods containing pesticides, effectively increasing their exposure, while also decreasing their total food intake; however, behavioral responses in semifield and field conditions are less understood. Here we conducted a feeder experiment with freely flying bees to determine the effects of a sublethal, field-realistic concentration of imidacloprid (IMD) on the foraging and recruitment behaviors of honey bees visiting either a control feeder containing a sucrose solution or a treatment feeder containing the same sucrose solution with IMD. We report that IMD-treated honey bees foraged less frequently (-28%) and persistently (-66%) than control foragers. Recruitment behaviors (dance frequency and dance propensity) also decreased with IMD, but nonsignificantly. Our results suggest that neonicotinoids inhibit honey bee foraging, which could potentially decrease food intake and adversely affect colony health. ¬© 2022 The Author(s).

To assess if exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin via a treated crop (rapeseed) affected bee behaviour, pollination performance (to strawberry), and bee reproduction, we provided each of 12 outdoor cages with rapeseed (autumn-sown plants complemented with a few spring-sown plants to extend the flowering period) grown from either clothianidin-treated or untreated (control) seeds, together with strawberry plants and a small population of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). We expected clothianidin to reduce bee foraging activity, resulting in impaired strawberry pollination and bee reproduction. During the early stage of the experiment, we observed no difference between treatments in the length of entire foraging trips, or the combined number of rapeseed and strawberry flowers that the bees visited during these trips. During the later stage of the experiment, we instead determined the time a female took to visit 10 rapeseed flowers, as a proxy for foraging performance. We found that they were 10% slower in clothianidin cages. Strawberries weighed less in clothianidin cages, suggesting reduced pollination performance, but we were unable to relate this to reduced foraging activity, because the strawberry flowers received equally many visits in the two treatments. Clothianidin-exposed females sealed their nests less often, but offspring number, sex ratio and weight were similar between treatments. Observed effects on bee behaviour appeared by the end of the experiment, possibly because of accumulated effects of exposure, reduced bee longevity, or higher sensitivity of the protocols we used during the later phase of the experiment. Although the lack of a mechanistic explanation calls for interpreting the results with cautiousness, the lower strawberry weight in clothianidin cages highlights the importance of understanding complex effects of plant protection products, which could have wider consequences than those on directly exposed organisms.  ¬© 2022 Herbertsson et al.

Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response.

Among others, the risk of exposure is high for bumblebee (Bombus spp.) queens hibernating in agricultural soils. An important question is whether bumblebee queens can detect and avoid pesticide-contaminated soils, or whether they might be attracted to such agrochemical residues. To address this question, we performed a multiple-choice preference experiment in which newly emerged bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens were given access to arrays of 36 crates of soil treated with different pesticides in large mesh-covered enclosures. Five of the most commonly encountered pesticides in agricultural soils (boscalid, chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, cyantraniliprole, difenoconazole) were selected for testing at two contamination levels (lower or higher), based on field-realistic exposure estimates. Bumblebee queens consistently avoided hibernating in pesticide-free soil at both contamination levels, while showing no avoidance for any pesticide-treated soil types. At the lower contamination level, queens selected the pesticide-free soil 1.3 to 2.4-fold less frequently on average than any of the spiked soils, while none of the queens from the higher contamination group selected pesticide-free soil. This apparent preference for pesticide-contaminated soils increases the likelihood of exposure to and potential hazard from pesticide residues in soil for bumblebee queens during hibernation, a critical and highly vulnerable period of their annual life cycle. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176534,954.0,,,,,,"['agricultural land', 'agricultural soil', 'Anthropogenic', 'Article', 'Avoidance', 'avoidance behavior', 'bee', 'Behavioral effects', 'behavioral response', 'Behavioural effect', 'Bumble bee', 'bumblebee', 'clothianidin', 'difenoconazole', 'Ecological trap', 'environmental factor', 'hibernation', 'landscape', 'life cycle', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'maximum concentration', 'Multiple choice', 'Multiple-choice preference', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'overwintering', 'Overwintering', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticide exposure', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollution effect', 'pollution exposure', 'Preference', 'preference behavior', 'Risk assessment', 'soil pollution', 'Soil pollution', 'Solidago', 'substrate', 'temperature', 'vulnerability']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205338389&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.176534&partnerID=40&md5=79a36f4ceb1353b863a14c6e8815a1f7,Scopus,,0,,1,103

Pesticides can be present in pollen, nectar, and persist in stored food (honey and bee bread), and viruses can be highly prevalent in honey bee colonies. Therefore, the present study describes the influence of chronic co-exposure to thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) on bee survival, virus loads, expression level of immune and detoxication genes, and pesticide metabolism Experiments were performed on honey bees collected from a winter apiary with reduced viral contaminations. No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology. ¬© 2019 Coulon et al.

Because of the haplo-diploid sex determination system in hymenopterans, experiments using micro-colonies (small sub colonies without a queen) to identify risks to bumblebee health are limited as they are only able to produce males. Therefore, an experimental protocol for rearing bumblebee larvae in vitro is needed to better understand effects on worker larvae. Here, we aimed to establish a rearing method for larvae of Bombus terrestris for use in risk assessment assays. To confirm the validity of our rearing method, we tested two insecticides used for tomato cultivation, chlorfenapyr and dinotefuran. Bombus terrestris larvae fed with a high nutrient quantity and quality diet increased growth per day. All chlorfenapyr-exposed individuals died within 10¬†days at 2000-fold dilution, an application dose used for tomatoes. There were significant differences in adult emergence rate among almost all chlorfenapyr treatments. On the other hand, sublethal dinotefuran-exposure did not affect rates of pupation and adult emergence, growth, or larval and pupal periods. Although larvae were smaller than in the natural colony, this rearing method for B. terrestris larvae proved to be effective at evaluating realistic sub-colonies to pesticide exposures. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-19965-0,12.0,1,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'chlorfenapyr', 'dinotefuran', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'human', 'Humans', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'male', 'Male', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity Tests']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138350597&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-19965-0&partnerID=40&md5=587842141e7d2a3bc8364f604f12f8d8,Scopus,,0,,1,105

Here, we analysed the interacting effects of plant protection products and low nutritional pollen source on honey bee health under semi-field conditions. We established a healthy honey bee colony in each of 24 tents, planted either with monofloral maize, maize with a diverse flower strip or with monofloral Phacelia tanacetifolia. To evaluate the interaction between exposure to PPPs and nutritional status, a mixture of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide prochloraz was applied. For each colony, we investigated brood capping rate as well as adult longevity, body and head weight, and enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase of newly hatched worker bees. We found a significant reduced capping rate in treated maize compared to flowering strips and Phacelia, but no interaction effect between pesticide treatment and nutritional status on capping rate. The response to treatment on the longevity of adults differed significantly between maize and Phacelia, with flower strips being intermediate, indicating interaction effects of PPP treatment and low pollen quality in maize compared to Phacelia and flowering strip treatments. Head weight of newly hatched worker bees showed significant interaction of nutritional status and treatment of PPPs. PPPs slightly increased body weight in all nutritional statuses, except for Phacelia. Enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase showed significant different responses between maize and Phacelia to PPP exposure, but not between maize and flowering strip.

Foraging activity and strength of colonies of both species were measured nine times over the fruiting season, previous, during and after insecticide application. We did not find a significant difference in foraging activity and strength between exposed and control colonies of A. mellifera during the observation period. However, colonies of S. mexicana seemed to be affected by the exposure, as revealed by a reduction in colony strength. However, 1 yr later, with no insecticide applications, the colonies of both species were evaluated and found to be in good conditions.

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes. Trialling the framework in our study system, we found that our focal insecticide, thiacloprid, improved red clover seed yield with no detected effects on its key pollinator, B. terrestris, and that the presence of red clover in the landscape can benefit pollinator populations.",2022/09//,2022,10.1111/1365-2664.14244,59.0,9,0021-8901,WOS:000829713200001,2419,2429,,,"['bee', 'Bombus', 'conceptual framework', 'crop yield', 'flowering', 'herb', 'insecticide', 'mass-flowering crop', 'nectar', 'pesticide', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'red clover', 'trade-off', 'yield']",,,,0,,1,108

These fields were paired at multiple sites in 2017-2020 with the only difference being pest management regimes: a standard set of conventional management (CM) practices vs. an integrated pest management (IPM) system that uses scouting and pest thresholds to determine if/when insecticides are used. Between these two systems we compared the performance (e.g., growth, survival) of managed pollinators-honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)-along with the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators. Compared to CM fields, IPM led to higher growth and lower mortality of managed bees, while also increasing the abundance (+ 147%) and richness (+ 128%) of wild pollinator species, and lower concentrations of neonicotinoids in the hive material of both managed bees.

Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

It is recommended against sucking insects and marketed as 'harmless' to honeybees. Flupyradifurone binds to nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors like neonicotinoids, but it has a different mode of action. So far, little is known on how sublethal flupyradifurone doses affect honeybees. We chronically applied a sublethal and field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone to test for long-term effects on flight behaviour using radio-frequency identification. We examined haematoxylin/eosin-stained brains of flupyradifurone-treated bees to investigate possible changes in brain morphology and brain damage.

Therefore, a better understanding on how the availability and quality of pollen diets can modulate honeybee sensitivity to pesticides is required. For that purpose, we evaluated the toxicity of acute exposure and chronic exposures to field realistic and higher concentrations of azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) in honeybees provided with pollen diets of differing qualities (named S and BQ pollens). We found that pollen intake reduced the toxicity of the acute doses of pesticides. Contrary to azoxystrobin, chronic exposures to sulfoxaflor increased by 13- to 12-fold bee mortality, which was reduced by pollen intake. Most importantly, the risk of death upon exposure to a high concentration of sulfoxaflor was significantly lower for the S pollen diet when compared with the BQ pollen diet. This reduced pesticide toxicity was associated with a higher gene expression of vitellogenin, a glycoprotein that promotes bee longevity, a faster sulfoxaflor metabolization and a lower concentration of the phytochemical p-coumaric acid, known to upregulate detoxification enzymes. Thus, our study revealed that pollen quality can influence the ability of bees to metabolize pesticides and withstand their detrimental effects, providing another strong argument for the restoration of suitable foraging habitat.",2021/09/01/,2021,10.1098/rsos.210818,8.0,9,,,2054-5703,WOS:000691542000008,"['survival', 'pesticide residue', 'vitellogenin', 'bees', 'metabolization', 'p-coumaric acid']",,,,,,0,,1,117

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,,,0,,1,118
174,425,JOUR,Bumblebees are resilient to neonicotinoid-fungicide combinations,"['Schuhmann, A.', 'Schulte, J.', 'Feldhaar, H.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Environment International,"Bumblebees are among the most important wild bees for pollination of crops and securing wildflower diversity. However, their abundance and diversity have been on a steady decrease in the last decades. One of the most important factors leading to their decline is the frequent use of plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture, which spread into forests and natural reserves. Mixtures of different PPPs pose a particular threat because of possible synergistic effects. While there is a comparatively large body of studies on the effects of PPPs on honeybees, we still lack data on wild bees. We here investigated the influence of the frequent fungicide Cantus¬Æ Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan¬Æ (acetamiprid) and their combination on bumblebees. Cognitive performance and foraging flights of bumblebees were studied. They are essential for the provisioning and survival of the colony. We introduce a novel method for testing four treatments simultaneously on the same colony, minimizing inter-colony differences. For this, we successfully quartered the colony and moved the queen daily between compartments. Bumblebees appeared astonishingly resilient to the PPPs tested or they have developed mechanisms for detoxification. Neither learning capacity nor flight activity were inhibited by treatment with the single PPPs or their combination. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108608,186.0,,,,,,"['2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'acetamiprid', 'agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'biphenyl derivative', 'boscalid', 'bumblebee', 'catering service', 'cognition', 'Cognitive performance', 'color preference test', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'dimoxystrobin', 'drug effect', 'flight', 'foraging', 'foraging behavior', 'forest', 'Forest reserves', 'Forestry', 'fungicide', 'Fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'learning', 'mortality', 'Natural reserves', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Niacinamide', 'nicotinamide', 'Novel methods', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'pesticide resistance', 'physiology', 'plant protection product', 'Plant protection products', 'pollination', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'synergism', 'synergistic effect', 'Synergistic effect', 'Synergistic effects', 'unclassified drug', 'Wild bee', 'Wild bees']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189564332&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2024.108608&partnerID=40&md5=9fc756abf41a340efaed788ab5e021fe,Scopus,,0,,1,119

However, insecticides sprayed during citrus bloom like chlorpyrifos (up to 167 ng g ‚àí1)and dimethoate (up to 34 ng g ‚àí1)were the main responsible of the relevant pesticide hazard in this matrix. Pesticide levels in live bees were mostly residual, and pesticide hazard was low. Beeswax of the apiaries, contaminated by miticides, revealed a low pesticide hazard to honey bee colonies. Acute mortality episodes occurred only in the two apiaries located near agricultural settings. Dead bees collected during these episodes revealed high levels (up to 2700 ng g ‚àí1)of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, omethoate and imidacloprid.

Beekeepers in the Wilaya of Tizi-Ouzou (Algeria) reported unusual losses and deaths of bee colonies in the places where imidacloprid insecticide was used. Even at sublethal doses, insecticide can affect tasks performed by workers in a colony, such as comb building. The study investigated the effect of an imidacloprid based insecticide (Confidor¬ÆSupra) on the production of wax by the honeybee Apis mellifera intermissa. After the imidacloprid LD50 was determined in controlled conditions, three sublethal doses were tested. The mortality of the bees, syrup consumption and the weight of the wax generated were recorded. The imidacloprid insecticide LD50 at 48 hours was 3.5 ng bee‚Äì1 for 4-day old spring worker bees. The three sublethal doses (0.175 mg L‚Äì1, 0.087 mg L‚Äì1 and 0.035 mg L‚Äì1) had an impact on the syrup consumption and the wax production of adult bees. Bees exposed to sublethal doses of insecticide consumed less syrup and produced less wax (between 0.040‚Äì0.415 g) than the bees in the control (0.745 g). A dose response was observed regarding the production of wax. This impact could have harmful consequences for bee colonies, as wax production is the basis of comb building.

337,583,JOUR,Butenolide Insecticide Flupyradifurone Affects Honey Bee Worker Antiviral Immunity and Survival,"['Harwood, G.P.', 'Prayugo, V.', 'Dolezal, A.G.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Honey bees face many environmental stressors, including exposure to pesticides and pathogens. A novel butenolide pesticide, flupyradifurone, was recently introduced to the US and shown to have a bee-friendly toxicity profile. Like the much-scrutinized neonicotinoids that preceded it, flupyradifurone targets the insect nervous system. Some neonicotinoids have been shown to interfere with antiviral immunity, which raised the concern that similar effects may be observed with flupyradifurone. In this study, we investigated how flupyradifurone and a neonicotinoid, clothianidin, affect the ability of honey bee workers to combat an infection of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). We exposed workers to field-realistic doses of the pesticides either with or without co-exposure with the virus, and then tracked survival and changes in viral titers. We repeated the experiment in the spring and fall to look for any seasonal effects. We found that flupyradifurone caused elevated mortality in the fall, but it did not lead to increased virus-induced mortality. Flupyradifurone also appeared to affect virus clearance, as bees co-exposed to the pesticide and virus tended to have higher viral titers after 48 hours than those exposed to the virus alone. Clothianidin had no effect on viral titers, and it actually appeared to increase resistance to viral infection in spring bees.

148,654,JOUR,Neonicotinoids in the agroecosystem: In-field long-term assessment on honeybee colony strength and microbiome,"['Alberoni, D.', 'Favaro, R.', 'Baffoni, L.', 'Angeli, S.', 'Di Gioia, D.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bees can be severely affected by various plant protection products (PPP). Among these, neonicotinoid insecticides are of concern as they have been shown to be responsible for extensive honeybee colonies death when released into the environment. Also, sublethal neonicotinoid doses contaminating single honeybees and their colonies (e.g. through contaminated pollen) are responsible for honeybees physiological alterations with probable implication also on microbiome functionality. Honeybees show symbiotic interactions with specific gut bacteria that can enhance the adult host performances. Among the known mechanisms, the modulation of the immune system, the degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites, pollen digestion, and hormonal signaling, are the most important functional benefits for the host honeybee. To date, few research efforts have aimed at revealing the impact of PPP on the gut microbial community of managed and wild honeybees. The majority of the existing literature relays on cage or semifield tests of short duration for research investigating neonicotinoids-gut microbiome interactions. This research wanted to unravel the impact of two neonicotinoids (i.e. imidacloprid and thiacloprid) in natural field conditions up to 5 weeks of exposure. A long-term impact of neonicotinoids on gut microbial community of honeybees was observed. The alterations affected several microbial genera and species such as Frischella spp., lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, whose shifting is implicated in intestinal dysbiosis. Long-term impact leading to dysbiosis was detected in case of exposure to imidacloprid, whereas thiacloprid exposure stimulated temporary dysbiosis. Moreover, the microbial diversity was significantly reduced in neonicotinoid-treated groups. Overall, the reported results support a compromised functionality of the gut microbial community, that might reflect a lower efficiency in the ecosystemic functionality of honeybees. ¬© 2020",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144116,762.0,,,,,,"['agricultural ecosystem', 'agroecosystem', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bifidobacterium', 'colony', 'controlled study', 'DNA', 'DNA extraction', 'dysbiosis', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'exposure', 'Frischella', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'high throughput sequencing', 'honeybee', 'Hormonal signaling', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'immunomodulation', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'intestine flora', 'Lactobacillus', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'Microbial communities', 'microbial community', 'microbial diversity', 'Microbial diversity', 'microbiome', 'Microbiota', 'Natural field conditions', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'Plant metabolites', 'Plant protection products', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'priority journal', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'symbiosis', 'Symbiotic interaction', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098732480&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.144116&partnerID=40&md5=462b323cd798437076931b01ccc30e27,Scopus,,0,,1,123

Several of these molecules are toxic to non-target organisms such as pollinators and their lethal dose can be lowered if applied as a mixture. They can cause large and unpredictable problems, spanning from behavioural changes to alterations in the gut. The present work aimed at understanding the synergistic effects on honeybees of a combined inhive exposure to sublethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide penconazole. A multidisciplinary approach was used: honeybee mortality upon exposure was initially tested in cage, and the colonies development monitored. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses via light and transmission electron microscopy were carried out on the gut of larvae and forager honeybees. Moreover, the main pollen foraging sources and the fungal gut microbiota were studied using Next Generation Sequencing; the gut core bacterial taxa were quantified via qPCR. The mortality test showed a negative effect on honeybee survival when exposed to agrochemicals and their mixture in cage but not confirmed at colony level. Microscopy analyses on the gut epithelium indicated no appreciable morphological changes in larvae, newly emerged and forager honeybees exposed in field to the agrochemicals. Nevertheless, the gut microbial profile showed a reduction of Bombilactobacillus and an increase of Lactobacillus and total fungi upon mixture application. Finally, we highlighted for the first time a significant honeybee diet change after pesticide exposure: penconazole, alone or in mixture, significantly altered the pollen foraging preference, with honeybees preferring Hedera pollen. Overall, our inhive results showed no severe effects upon administration of sublethal doses of thiacloprid and penconazole but indicate a change in honeybees foraging preference.

Bees are effective pollinators in increasing the production of agricultural commodities. The stingless bee Tetragonula laeviceps (Apidae: Meliponini) is widely cultivated and found around plantations. The insecticides used in the toxicity test were imidacloprid 200 g/L, fipronil 50 g/L, lambda-cyhalothrin 25 g/L, profenofos 500 g/L, and chlorantraniliprole 50 g/L followed by a semi-field test using imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides on the cucumber plant. The LC50 value showed that exposure to imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides caused toxic effects on T. laeviceps by contact and orally. Lambda-cyhalothrin was found harmful on contact exposure, in contrast, chlorantraniliprole was harmful through oral. Classification of insecticide toxicity based on LD50 contact for imidacloprid, fipronil, lambda-cyhalothrin, and profenofos were very toxic and needed a risk assessment. However, chlorantraniliprole was classified as moderately toxic and low risk. In semi-field test results, imidacloprid and fipronil insecticides caused a significant decrease in the leave-return and bee-visiting activity on cucumber flowers.

469,162,JOUR,"Field relevance of a synergistic effect observed in the laboratory between an EBI fungicide and a chloronicotinyl insecticide in the honeybee (Apis mellifera L, Hymenoptera)","['Schmuck, R', 'Stadler, T', 'Schmidt, HW']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"It had been found earlier that the chloronicotinyl insecticide thiacloprid (as the 480 g litre(-1) SC Calypso(R)) poses a favourably low toxicity hazard to the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. As with pyrethroids, the metabolization of chloronicotinyl compounds involves monooxygenases, which are known to be inhibited by some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides potentially co-applied with these insecticides. The potential synergistic enhancement of the toxicity of thiacloprid to honeybees when co-applied with such fungicides was therefore studied under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Fungicides of other chemical classes were also examined for synergistic potential to reveal other metabolic interactions. In the laboratory, only a slight synergistic effect was observed with the anilinopyrimidine fungicide examined, while a significant enhancement of thiacloprid toxicity to honeybees was found with EBI fungicides. In three tunnel tests conducted under different environmental conditions to simulate field exposure, no increased mortality was observed when honeybees were directly sprayed with thiacloprid (Calypso) alone or in combination with the EBI fungicide tebuconazole (250 g litre(-1) EW, Folicur(R)). There was also no synergized reduction in the foraging intensity on the treated crop. In general, the foraging intensity decreased after thiacloprid treatment but was restored within 24-48 h.

Nuclei enclosing one-fourth Dadant frame, are made with Plexiglas sides allowing a complete observation of the insects. After the nuclei are filled with pollen, brood and 1,000 adult bees, foraging bees are trained to visit a feeding station placed at the center of the tunnel, which means a 10 m distance from the entrance of the nuclei. The day-time of the disposal of the sugar solution is to be strictly regarded. When the foragers are well trained to forage a sucrose solution, a contaminated one is offered the following days. Criteria of observation can be (i) the foragers recruitment, (ii) the number of feeding bees and their behaviour at the feeder, (iii) the return flights, (iv) the trophallaxis inside the nucleus. Such a protocol has been put into practice to demonstrate the alteration of the homing flight in bees exposed to sublethal doses of deltamethrin (Vandame et al., 1995).

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

Trigona spinipes populations can be negatively impacted by insecticides commonly used for pest control in crops. However, this species has been neglected in toxicological studies. Here we observed the effects of seven insecticides on the survival of bees that had fed directly on insecticide-contaminated food sources or received insecticides via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates. The effects of insecticides on flight behavior were also determined for the compounds considered to be of low toxicity. RESULTS: Imidacloprid, spinosad and malathion were categorized as highly toxic to T. spinipes, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin, methomyl and chlorfenapyr were of medium to low toxicity and interfered with two aspects of flight behavior evaluated here. Chlorantraniliprole was the only insecticide tested here that had no significant effect on T. spinipes survival, although it did interfere with one aspect of flight capacity. A single bee that had ingested malathion, spinosad or imidacloprid, could contaminate three, four and nineteen other bees, respectively via trophallaxis, resulting in the death of the recipients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the ecotoxicology of a range of insecticides that not only negatively affected T. spinipes survival, but also interfered with flight capacity, a very important aspect of pollination behavior. The toxicity of the insecticides was observed following direct ingestion and also via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates, highlighting the possibility of lethal effects of these insecticides spreading throughout the colony, reducing the survival of non-foraging individuals.

401,148,JOUR,Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 ¬µL for honeybees and to 2 ¬µL for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower for the red mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,,,1,,0,132

Sublethal effects, such as behavior alterations, are neglected in pesticide regulation for pollinators. However, these effects can bring important information to understanding the impacts of pesticides on bees' daily activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) on the behavior of the Neotropical solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male bees were exposed to these chemicals continuously for 48 h, followed by an additional 48 h without contaminated food, totaling 96 h of observation. We used five experimental groups: control, solvent control, insecticide, fungicide, and pesticide mixture (insecticide + fungicide). Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli. Bees exposed to acetamiprid and pesticide mixture showed lethargic movements and impaired locomotion at 48 h. Notably, these behavioral effects were no longer evident after the bees consumed uncontaminated food for an additional 48 h, totaling 96 h from the start of pesticide exposure. Only fungicide exposure did not result in any behavioral or brain histological changes. Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees. These findings highlight the importance of considering sublethal effects in environmental risk assessment. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143254,364.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'Azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bees', 'behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavior, Animal', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral science', 'bootstrapping', 'brain', 'Brain', 'central nervous system', 'Centris analis', 'controlled study', 'drug effect', 'environmental risk', 'Exposed to', 'female', 'Female', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'histopathology', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'kenyon cell', 'locomotion', 'Locomotion', 'Macroinvertebrates', 'male', 'Male', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid', 'movement (physiology)', 'mushroom', 'Mushroom bodies', 'mushroom body', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Neotropical bee', 'Neotropical Region', 'Neotropics', 'nerve cell', 'nonhuman', 'organic farming', 'perception', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticide mixture', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'phototaxis', 'physiology', 'pollinator', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'Pyrimidines', 'regulatory mechanism', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Sublethal effects', 'toxicity', 'unclassified drug', 'Video-tracking']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203020312&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.143254&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0579ad3d1ff4544f162d578e82d2d,Scopus,,1,,0,133

Previous studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon originates from abnormal neural development in response to imidacloprid exposure. Here, we further investigated the global gene expression changes in the heads of newly emerged adults and observed that 578 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in gene expression after imidacloprid exposure. This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated. These downregulation patterns were further confirmed through analyses using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the heads of 6-day-old nurse bees.

Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36¬∞C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20¬∞C). At 20¬∞C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36¬∞C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced. This study contributes to the understanding of how neonicotinoid residual doses may alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102696,93.0,,,,,,"['adult', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'brain', 'Brain', 'brain region', 'cold treatment', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'drug effect', 'gene', 'Gene expression', 'gene overexpression', 'genetics', 'heat shock protein 70', 'heat shock protein 90', 'heat shock response', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'high temperature', 'Honey bee', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'insect protein', 'Insect Proteins', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'motor activity', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nervous system', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'norsynephrine receptor', 'octopamine receptor gene', 'olfactory system', 'pilot study', 'protein expression', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'receptor', 'Receptors, Biogenic Amine', 'Residual doses', 'stress', 'temperature', 'Temperature', 'temperature sensitivity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089956447&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtherbio.2020.102696&partnerID=40&md5=11df331a17c8d5a06377ab9e7a9f3be2,Scopus,,1,,0,135

We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5 ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g). Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or beebread (all P > 0.05). Field surveys may underestimate honey bee exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticides or the risk of exposure in different landscapes because of low detection rates. Undetectably low levels of exposure or high levels of exposure that go undetected raise questions with regard to potential threats to honey bees and other pollinators. ¬© The Author(s) 2018.

The extensive use of neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid, as agricultural pesticides, leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in bees, pollen, nectar, and honey, thereby inducing deleterious effects. Forager honey bees face significant exposure to pesticide residues while searching for resources outside the hive, particularly systemic pesticides like imidacloprid. In this study, 360 Apis mellifera bees, twenty-one days old (supposed to be in the forager phase) previously marked were fed syrup (honey and water, 1:1 m/v) containing a lethal dose (0.081 Œºg/bee) or sublethal dose (0.00081 Œºg/bee) of imidacloprid. The syrup was provided in plastic troughs, with 250 ŒºL added per trough onto each plastic Petri dish containing 5 bees (50 ŒºL per bee). The bees were kept in the plastic Petri dishes inside an incubator, and after 1 and 4 h of ingestion, the bees were euthanised and stored in an ultra-freezer (‚àí80 ¬∞C) for transcriptome analysis. Following the 1-h ingestion of imidacloprid, 1516 genes (73 from lethal dose; 1509 from sublethal dose) showed differential expression compared to the control, while after 4 h, 758 genes (733 from lethal dose; 25 from sublethal) exhibited differential expression compared to the control. All differentially expressed genes found in the brain tissue transcripts of forager bees were categorised based on gene ontology into functional groups encompassing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. These analyses revealed that sublethal doses might be capable of altering more genes than lethal doses, potentially associated with a phenomenon known as insecticide-induced hormesis. Alterations in genes related to areas such as the immune system, nutritional metabolism, detoxification system, circadian rhythm, odour detection, foraging activity, and memory in bees were present after exposure to the pesticide. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of both lethal and sublethal doses of imidacloprid, thereby providing valuable insights for establishing public policies regarding the use of neonicotinoids, which are directly implicated in the compromised health of Apis mellifera bees. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173393,940.0,,,,,,"['agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'apiculture', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Beekeeping', 'Bees', 'beta galactosidase', 'circadian rhythm', 'climate change', 'Climate change', 'deformity', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'false discovery rate', 'Food products', 'galactosidase', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene Expression', 'gene ontology', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genes expression', 'honey', 'honeybee', 'Hormesis', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'immune system', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide-induced hormesis', 'Insecticides', 'lethal dose', 'Lethal dose', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'parasite', 'peptide synthesis', 'Pesticide', 'Petri dish', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population', 'Population statistics', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'ribosome', 'RNA binding', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'temperature', 'vulnerability']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195060066&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.173393&partnerID=40&md5=d3c9ad12954c60ff9587c3c21a2f36a5,Scopus,,1,,0,137

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125Œºgl-1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10Œºgl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. ¬© 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",2012///,2012,10.1016/j.zool.2012.05.003,115.0,6,365,371,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870240538&doi=10.1016%2fj.zool.2012.05.003&partnerID=40&md5=f9694f4c3af4c4e61190c0e36dc908fa,Scopus,,0,,0,139

This species has a yearly life cycle and colony success may rely on effective foraging of workers on ruderal plants late in summer when most crops are no longer flowering. In the current study, we investigated the effect of chronic exposure to Sulfoxaflor on aspects of the foraging behavior of bumble bees and whether Sulfoxaflor influences the body size of workers of B. terrestris in a crop landscape. We found that 2 weeks of continuous exposure to Sulfoxaflor influenced workers‚Äô foraging dynamics and collection of resources. However, there was no evidence that the 5 ppb dose of the pesticide impacted the ability of bees to handle flowers with different traits. Workers from colonies exposed to Sulfoxaflor were smaller. The effect on worker size may be explained as a consequence of the reduced pollen income per unit of worker foraging. Thus, if the effects of Sulfoxaflor applied directly to crops had the same effect as that observed on commercial bumble bees after our chronic exposure, it might negatively impact colony success due to the impact on pollen collection and the reduction in the size of workers.

352,372,JOUR,Honeybee pollen but not nectar foraging greatly reduced by neonicotinoids: Insights from AI and simulation,"['Wang, M', 'Tausch, F', 'Schmidt, K', 'Diehl, M', 'Knaebe, S', 'Bargen, H', 'Materne, L', 'Groeneveld, J', 'Grimm, V']",COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,"Honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) as pollinators are of economic and ecological importance to global agriculture and natural ecosystems. However, honeybees are being threatened by highly effective pesticides such as neonicotinoids, which can have detrimental impacts on honeybee foraging in particular. In a colony, nectar and pollen foragers play distinct roles in sustaining the colony. Despite evidence of sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees, little is known about how neonicotinoids affect the foraging behaviour of an entire colony. Here, we conducted a field study using our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated monitoring technology to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field-realistic sub-lethal doses on colony foraging behaviour. A mechanistic simulation model (BEEHAVE) was then used to reproduce and interpret field observations, and further identify the plausible mechanisms underlying the empirical findings. Surprisingly, the field study revealed that imidacloprid greatly reduced pollen foraging but not nectar foraging. In addition, no lethal effects on honeybees were observed. The simulations showed that the time spent by pollen foragers on completing their foraging trips was significantly increased, which subsequently decreased the number of pollen foraging trips per day, thereby reducing pollen foraging at the colony level. This suggests that pollen and nectar foraging may require different energetic costs, cognitive functions, and/or gene expressions, which implies different susceptibilities of pollen and nectar foragers to chemical stressors. As pollen foraging is essential for brood rearing, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids, together with other stressors, may affect colony survival and resilience more than previously thought.",2024/06//undefined,2024,10.1016/j.compag.2024.108966,221.0,,,,0168-1699,WOS:001240235200001,"['Insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Foraging behaviours', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'Sublethal effects', 'Imidacloprids', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'simulation', 'nectar', 'artificial intelligence', 'Ecology', 'Automated monitoring', 'biomonitoring', 'Computational modelling', 'ecological impact', 'Field studies', 'Foraging trips', 'Gene expression', 'numerical model', 'Oomen study']",,,,,,0,simulation,0,142
116,924,JOUR,Neonicotinoids and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris): Effects on nectar consumption in individual workers,"['Thompson, H.M.', 'Wilkins, S.', 'Harkin, S.', 'Milner, S.', 'Walters, K.F.A.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to quantify whether the presence of three different neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam or clothianidin) in sucrose solution results in antifeedant effects in individual worker bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), and, if so, whether this effect is reversible if bees are subsequently offered untreated feed. RESULTS: Bees exposed to imidacloprid displayed a significant dose-dependent reduction in consumption at 10 and 100 Œºg L-1, which was reversed when untreated feed was offered. No consistent avoidance/antifeedant response to nectar substitute with thiamethoxam was detected at the more field-realistic dose rates of 1 and 10 Œºg L-1, and exposure to the very high 100 Œºg L-1 dose rate was followed by 100% mortality of experimental insects. No reduction in food intake was recorded at 1 Œºg clothianidin L-1, reduced consumption was noted at 10 Œºg clothianidin L-1 and 100% mortality occurred when bees were exposed to rates of 100 Œºg clothianidin L-1.

402,479,JOUR,Honey bees and bumble bees may be exposed to pesticides differently when foraging on agricultural areas,"['Zioga, E.', 'White, B.', 'Stout, J.C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"In an agricultural environment, where crops are treated with pesticides, bees are likely to be exposed to a range of chemical compounds in a variety of ways. The extent to which different bee species are affected by these chemicals, largely depends on the concentrations and type of exposure. We quantified the presence of selected pesticide compounds in the pollen of two different entomophilous crops; oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Sampling was performed in 12 sites in Ireland and our results were compared with the pollen loads of honey bees and bumble bees actively foraging on those crops in those same sites. Detections were compound specific, and the timing of pesticide application in relation to sampling likely influenced the final residue contamination levels. Most detections originated from compounds that were not recently applied on the fields, and samples from B. napus fields were more contaminated compared to those from V. faba fields. Crop pollen was contaminated only with fungicides, honey bee pollen loads contained mainly fungicides, while more insecticides were detected in bumble bee pollen loads. The highest number of compounds and most detections were observed in bumble bee pollen loads, where notably, all five neonicotinoids assessed (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were detected despite the no recent application of these compounds on the fields where samples were collected. The concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides were positively correlated with the number of wild plant species present in the bumble bee-collected pollen samples, but this relationship could not be verified for honey bees. The compounds azoxystrobin, boscalid and thiamethoxam formed the most common pesticide combination in pollen. Our results raise concerns about potential long-term bee exposure to multiple residues and question whether honey bees are suitable surrogates for pesticide risk assessments for all bee species. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166214,896.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'Agricultural areas', 'Agricultural environments', 'agricultural land', 'animal', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Brassica napus', 'Bumble bee', 'bumblebee', 'chemistry', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (parameter)', 'contamination', 'Contamination', 'controlled study', 'correlation analysis', 'crop', 'Crops', 'environmental exposure', 'Exposed to', 'Food products', 'foraging behavior', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'honey', 'Honey', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Ireland', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollen contamination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'quantitative analysis', 'rapeseed', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'sampling', 'thiacloprid', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'unclassified drug', 'Vicia faba', 'wild plant']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168804307&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166214&partnerID=40&md5=00431f4815c28188a444632c9c984d06,Scopus,,0,residues,0,144
224,806,JOUR,Synergistic effects of pathogen and pesticide exposure on honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival and immunity,"['Grassl, J.', 'Holt, S.', 'Cremen, N.', 'Peso, M.', 'Hahne, D.', 'Baer, B.']",Journal of Invertebrate Pathology,"Declines in native insect pollinator populations and substantial losses in managed honey bees have been reported on a global scale and become a widespread concern because of the importance of these insects for human food production and ecosystem stability. Several potential factors have been studied as possible causes of declining pollinator health, such as parasites and pathogens, exposure to agricultural pesticides, habitat loss and/or climate change. More recently, a combination of these factors rather than a single cause have been blamed for observed pollinator losses, but field studies of such interactions are challenging, especially in the presence of confounding environmental stressors. We therefore examined the impact of single and combined stressors on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a generally healthy Australian population. We exposed workers during their larval development and drones until they reached sexual maturity to the neonicotinoid pesticide Thiamethoxam, at concentrations more than 20 times lower than we initially measured in the field, the microsporidian gut pathogen Nosema apis or both stressors at the same time. We found that simultaneous exposure significantly reduced bee health. We observed a substantial increase in mortality and a reduction of immunocompetence in workers exposed to both the pathogen and the pesticide. We conclude that the exposure of generally healthy bees to multiple environmental stressors results in synergistic effects where the effects are expected to negatively impact performance and could be sufficient to trigger colony collapse. We found that the vast majority of males did not survive to sexual maturity after exposure to very low levels of Thiamethoxam. This would not only reduce the reproductive success of individual colonies, but can also impact gene flow and genetic diversity at the population level, which are both known as key components of honey bee health. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jip.2018.10.005,159.0,,78,86,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055575152&doi=10.1016%2fj.jip.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=d9ed9a9090c05697a15e59d9df1ede3c,Scopus,,0,,0,145

Here we exposed honey bee colonies during three brood generations to sub-lethal doses of a widely used pesticide, imidacloprid, and then subsequently challenged newly emerged bees with the gut parasite, Nosema spp. The pesticide dosages used were below levels demonstrated to cause effects on longevity or foraging in adult honey bees. Nosema infections increased significantly in the bees from pesticide-treated hives when compared to bees from control hives demonstrating an indirect effect of pesticides on pathogen growth in honey bees. We clearly demonstrate an increase in pathogen growth within individual bees reared in colonies exposed to one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide, imidacloprid, at below levels considered harmful to bees. The finding that individual bees with undetectable levels of the target pesticide, after being reared in a sub-lethal pesticide environment within the colony, had higher Nosema is significant.

163,998,JOUR,Risk assessment for side-effects of neonicotinoids against bumblebees with and without impairing foraging behavior,"['Mommaerts, V.', 'Reynders, S.', 'Boulet, J.', 'Besard, L.', 'Sterk, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Ecotoxicology,"Bombus terrestris bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers, and in modern agriculture they are used to guarantee pollination of vegetables and fruits. In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2010///,2010,10.1007/s10646-009-0406-2,19.0,1,207,215,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77249087124&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-009-0406-2&partnerID=40&md5=0a4b49f9dcca309b6d08542d84bf255f,Scopus,,0,,0,147

Two doses were used: D1=10 mu g PLL kg-l in syrup and 6 mu g AI kg(-1) in pollen; D2 was 2.5 times higher in syrup and 2.7 higher in pollen. During 85 days 27, 30 and 29 micro-colonies were reared for control, D1 and D2 treatments respectively. Food consumption was not affected by either dose. During the 5-day pre-oviposition period the mean insecticide intake was 4.8 ng per day per worker in treatment D2. Both doses slightly but significantly affected worker survival rate by 10% during the first month, without any dose-effect relationship. Brood production was significantly reduced in D1 treatment and larval ejection by workers was significantly lower in D1 and D2 than in control. No significant effect of D1 and D2 treatments on the duration of larval development was revealed. No residue could be detected in workers still alive after 85 days. It was concluded that the survival rate and reproductive capacity of B terrestris was not likely to be affected by prolonged ingestion of nectar produced by sunflower after seed-dressing treatment with imidacloprid (Gaucho), since honey or pollen collected by honeybees foraging treated sunflower never revealed concentrations of imidacloprid higher than 10 mu g kg(-1).

Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests.

Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5¬†¬µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6¬†ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1¬†g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicates that TMX has no adverse effects on viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the treatment of seeds with thiamethoxam, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388568,20.0,06-Jul,365,382,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036570302&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388568&partnerID=40&md5=caf3b85e15ff10f896cae621455c9207,Scopus,,0,,0,150

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 ¬µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Traditionally, most laboratory studies on bee ecotoxicology test acute exposure to single compounds. However, under field conditions, bees are often chronically exposed to a variety of chemicals, with potential synergistic effects. We studied the effects of field-realistic concentrations of three pesticides measured in pollen and nectar of commercial melon fields on the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We orally exposed females of this species throughout their life span to 8 treatments combining two neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid) and a triazole fungicide (myclobutanil) via pollen and sugar syrup. We measured pollen and syrup consumption, longevity, ovary maturation and thermogenesis. Pesticide intake was three orders of magnitude higher via syrup than pollen. At the tested concentrations, no synergistic effects emerged, and we found no effects on longevity and ovary maturation. However, all treatments containing imidacloprid resulted in suppressed syrup consumption and drastic decreases in thoracic temperature and bee activity. Our results have important implications for pesticide regulation. If we had measured only lethal effects we would have wrongly concluded that the pesticide combinations containing imidacloprid were safe to O. bicornis.

Therefore, special attention was given to reducing unintentional intoxications under field conditions. The sensitivity of winter bees throughout their long lifespan to residual exposure of pesticides is not well known, since most previous studies only looked at the effects on summer bees. Here, we performed various laboratory bioassays to assess the effects of clothianidin on the survival and behavior of winter bees. Oral lethal and sublethal doses were administered throughout 12-day. The obtained LD50 values at 48, 72, 96¬†h and 10¬†days were 26.9, 18.0, 15.1 and 9.5¬†ng/bee, respectively. Concentrations <20¬†¬µg/kg were found to be sublethal. Oral exposure to sublethal doses was carried out for 12-day and, the behavioral functions were tested on the respective 13th day. Although slight reductions in the responses at the concentrations 10 and 15¬†¬µg/kg were observed, all tested sublethal concentrations had showed non-significant effects on the sucrose responsiveness, habitation of the proboscis extension reflex and olfactory learning performance. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to 15¬†¬µg/kg affected the specificity of the early long-term memory (24¬†h).

623,529,JOUR,"Neonicotinoid pesticide applications affect pollinator abundance and visitation, leading to implications for sunflower production (Helianthus annuus L.)","['Saleem, M.S.', 'Akbar, M.F.', 'Javed, M.A.', 'Sultan, A.']",Cogent Food and Agriculture,"Pesticides are considered a risk to pollinators; however, little is known about the possible effects of their injudicious use on pollinators, including the ecosystem services provided to crops and wildflowers. Recently, great attention has been paid to the effects of neonicotinoids pesticides on pollinators and their potential role in harming the health of bees all over the world. Sunflowers, being self-incompatible plants, rely on insects, primarily bees, for effective cross-pollination and successful seed-set. Ensuring the presence of sufficient pollinators in the field is crucial for facilitating pollen movement between flowers and promoting optimal seed development. However, the reliance on insect-mediated cross-pollination also makes sunflowers susceptible to pest attacks, which can negatively impact seed production. To mitigate these potential threats and achieve increased seed yields, careful consideration is given to the judicious use of pesticides. Striking the right balance between providing adequate pollinators and implementing appropriate pest management strategies is vital for maximizing sunflower crop productivity. To reveal such potential impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides, we undergo the current study that aimed to estimate flower visitation and pollination in a sunflower crop by applying three neonicotinoid insecticides i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, including the control group for two years i.e. 2020, and 2021. In all experimental plots, we quantified floral visitors for fourteen days at three different times (8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm). Floral visitors were divided into three groups, Apis bees, Non-Apis bees, and butterflies. After the maturation period, the achenes from each capitulum were separated and brought for weight. We discovered that this study confirmed the adverse effect of neonicotinoids pesticides on sunflower production. Our research revealed that the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam had a negative impact on the visitation of Apis bees, with reductions of 19%, 18.5%, and 23% respectively, as compared to the control group during the year 2020. Furthermore, these pesticides also caused a decrease in the visitation of Non-Apis bees by 15%, 15%, and 17% respectively. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 17.4%, 14.6%, and 15.8% for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam respectively. Based on our research conducted in the year 2021, the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam caused a reduction of 22.5%, 24%, and 25.5% respectively in the visitation of Apis bees, as compared to the control group. Similarly, non-Apis bees experienced a decrease in visitation by 19.5%, 23.5%, and 25% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 18.2%, 22.2%, and 26% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the use of these pesticides affected the diversity of floral visitors and contributed to a decline in the number of fruit during the year 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the abundance of floral visitors, the mass of fruits, and the quantity of oil in the seeds were significantly lower after treatment with neonicotinoid pesticides, thus evidencing its negative effect on sunflower productivity.

As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.",2016/07//undefined,2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12644,30.0,7,1132,1139,0269-8463,WOS:000379978100012,,,,,,,0,,0,158

Two experimental groups of honey bee queen larvae were treated with thiamethoxam during artificial rearing, applied via artificial feed in two cycles. In the first rearing cycle, honey bee larvae received a single treatment dose (4.28¬†ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells), while the second honey bee queen rearing cycle received a double treatment dose (total of 8.56¬†ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th and 5th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells).

Neonicotinoid pesticides have been implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment testing the impacts of field relevant doses (1.87-5.32 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B. pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species, suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all four species.

We investigated the sublethal effects of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin on individual immunity, by studying three major aspects of immunocompetence in worker bees: total hemocyte number, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. In laboratory experiments, we found a strong impact of all three neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid (24 h oral exposure, 200 Œºg/l or 2000. Œºg/l) and imidacloprid (1 Œºg/l or 10 Œºg/l) reduced hemocyte density, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity even at field realistic concentrations. Clothianidin had an effect on these immune parameters only at higher than field realistic concentrations (50-200 Œºg/l).

We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss.

One of the most debated factors proposed to be contributing to pollinator declines is exposure to pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic insecticide. Also, newly emerging parasites and diseases, thought to be spread via contact with managed honeybees, may pose threats to other pollinators such as bumblebees. Compared to honeybees, bumblebees could be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stressors due to their smaller and more short-lived colonies. Here, we studied the effect of field-realistic, chronic clothianidin exposure and inoculation with the parasite Nosema ceranae on survival, fecundity, sugar water collection and learning using queenless Bombus terrestris audax microcolonies in the laboratory. Chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin had no significant effects on the traits studied. Interestingly, pesticide exposure in combination with additional stress caused by harnessing bees for Proboscis Extension Response (PER) learning assays, led to an increase in mortality. In contrast to previous findings, the bees did not become infected by N. ceranae after experimental inoculation with the parasite spores, suggesting variability in host resistance or parasite virulence. However, this treatment induced a slight, short-term reduction in sugar water collection, potentially through stimulation of the immune system of the bees.

Guttation fluid may contain neonicotinoid residues after plant uptake from seed treatments. To clarify the relevance of the guttation fluid as a water source for honey bee colonies and to assess potential associated risks under conditions of agronomic practice, various studies were performed in key broad acre crops such as maize, sugar beet, potato (in-furrow application), winter barley and oilseed rape by placing honeybee colonies adjacent to freshly emerged fields for several weeks and by following up potential lethal and sub-lethal effects, as well as potential effects on colony performance. Results: Guttation droplets contained peak residue levels theoretically capable of harming individual honeybees (i.e. several hundred ppm). Residue levels, however, generally decreased with time, as expected based on the physiological process involved. The temporal coincidence of honeybee flight activity and the presence of guttation droplets were generally limited to early morning hours and to a much lesser extent to evening hours. Spatially, honeybees were found to predominately collect water, if any, in the direct vicinity of the hives. Water collection generally ceased within a couple of metres distance to the hives, which renders distance to the crop to be a significant exposure factor, and in turn renders dew and guttation from off-crop vegetation to be more relevant to water collecting honeybees than guttation from the crop. Mortality events, if any, were scarce and generally matched in treatments and in controls. The absolute numbers of dead bees involved in these rare cases were so low that they did not translate into any colony level effects or impacts on bee health or overwintering success, nor on adverse effects on honey production of the involved colonies. Conclusions: Given the overall body of data, the associated intensity of the assessments in each study as well as the worst-case exposure conditions employed, it can be concluded that exposure of honeybee colonies to guttation fluid, excreted from neonicotinoid seed-treated crop plants, did not pose an unacceptable acute or chronic risk to honeybee colony development or survival, and does not adversely interfere with bee keeping practices. Overall, guttation water from seed treated crop plants was found not to be a significant exposure route for honeybees.",2015///,2015,,450.0,,160,167,1868-9892,WOS:000381782400029,,,"['Oomen, PA', 'Pistorius, J']",,,,0,residues,0,164

Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress.

Previous efforts have employed experimental approaches using small groups under laboratory conditions to investigate influence of these stressors on honey bee physiology and behaviour, although both the colony level and field conditions play a key role for eusocial honey bees. Here, we challenged honey bee workers under in vivo colony conditions with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, the miticide tau-fluvalinate and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae, to investigate potential effects on longevity and behaviour using observation hives. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, our results do not suggest interactions among stressors, but rather lone effects of pesticides and the parasite on mortality and behaviour, respectively. These effects appear to be weak due to different outcomes at the two study sites, thereby suggesting that the role of thiacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and N.ceranae and interactions among them may have been overemphasized. In the future, investigations into the effects of honey bee stressors should prioritize the use of colonies maintained under a variety of environmental conditions in order to obtain more biologically relevant data. ¬© 2015 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2015///,2015,10.1111/1462-2920.12825,17.0,11,4322,4331,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949312861&doi=10.1111%2f1462-2920.12825&partnerID=40&md5=c2fdfb7c8488627cb1c1545042677ba3,Scopus,,0,,0,167

In this study, larvae were exposed to three sublethal doses of clothianidin and evaluated 25‚Äì36¬†days later for hygienic and foraging behaviours as adult bees. The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen.

Sunflower seed are treated with 0.7 mg a.i./grain which is equivalent to 50 a.i./ha at a planting density of 70,000 plants/ha. In 3 tunnel and 8 field tests it was examined whether this seeddressing could have an influence on honeybees at the time of flowering. Residue analysis of flowers and honeybees were performed to determine the exposure of these pollinating insects during flowering. The residue levels were then compared with effect concentrations as determined in controlled feeding experiments. In none of the 3 tunnel and 8 field tests did the seeddressing with imidacloprid affect the vitality, the foraging activity or the behaviour of the honeybees. From these results it can be reliably concluded that a seeddressing of sunflower seed with imidacloprid has no biological relevance for honeybees. Pollen and nectar of sunflower plants were analysed for the presence of imidacloprid and its relevant metabolites. No quantifiable residue levels were found at a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb. In the controlled feeding experiments under field conditions, no adverse effects were observed on bees fed with spiked sugar solution up to 20 ppb imidacloprid. At higher concentrations (50-100 ppb) honeybees only reduced transitorily the foraging activity which indicates that honeybees realise the presence of imidacloprid at these levels. When these results are compared with the residue levels found in the relevant parts of the, sunflower plants it is evident that the findings of the tunnel and field tests are fully confirmed and that no adverse effects on honeybees must be expected from the use of Gauch (R) in sunflowers.",2001///,2001,,,,49,59,0293-1915,WOS:000170386300001,,,"['Belzunces, LP', 'Pelissier, C', 'Lewis, GB']",,,,0,,0,170

While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.",2018/10/08/,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0200041,13.0,10,,,1932-6203,WOS:000446632700003,,,,,,,0,,0,171

Such effects can be direct effects from insecticide exposure, but neonicotinoids can affect plant physiology, and effects could therefore also be indirectly mediated by changes in plant phenology, attractiveness and nutritional value. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we tested if seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affected oilseed rape‚Äôs production of flower resources for bees and the content of the secondary plant products glucosinolates that provide defense against herbivores. Additionally, we tested if seed treatment affected the attractiveness of oilseed rape to flower visiting bumblebees, using outdoor mesocosms. Flowers and leaves of clothianidin-treated plants had different profiles of glucosinolates compared with untreated plants. Bumblebees in mesocosms foraged slightly more on untreated plants. Neither flower timing, flower size nor the production of pollen and nectar differed between treatments, and therefore cannot explain any preference for untreated oilseed rape. We instead propose that this small but significant preference for untreated plants was related to the altered glucosinolate profile caused by clothianidin.

Many aspects have to be considered to avoid confounding effects which is probably the reason why they are not regularly performed in the context of risk assessments of plant protection products to pollinating insects.

In this paper we identify the requirements of a large-scale monitoring study for the assessment of side-effects of clothianidin seed-treated winter oilseed rape on three species of pollinating insects (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) and present how these requirements were implemented. Two circular study sites were delineated next to each other in northeast Germany and comprised almost 65 km2 each. At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado¬Æ). The comparison of environmental conditions at the study sites indicated that they are as similar as possible in terms of climate, soil, land use, history and current practice of agriculture as well as in availability of oilseed rape and non-crop bee forage. Accordingly, local environmental conditions were considered not to have had any confounding effect on the results of the monitoring of the bee species.

These losses have been further linked to the widespread use of agrochemicals associated with modern agricultural practices. Many of these chemicals are known to have negative sublethal effects on commercial pollinators, such as managed honeybees and bumblebees, but less is known about the impacts on wild bees. Laboratory-based studies with commercial pollinators have consistently shown that pesticide exposure can impact bee behavior, with cascading effects on foraging performance, reproductive success, and pollination services. However, these studies typically assess only one chemical, neglecting the complexity of real-world exposure to multiple agrochemicals and other stressors. In the summer of 2020, we collected wild-foraging workers of the common eastern bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, from five squash (Cucurbita) agricultural sites (organic and conventional farms), selected to represent a range of agrochemical, including neonicotinoid insecticide, use. For each bee, we measured two behaviors relevant to foraging success and previously shown to be impacted by pesticide exposure: sucrose responsiveness and locomotor activity. Following behavioral testing, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) chemical analysis to detect and quantify the presence of 92 agrochemicals in each bumblebee. Bees collected from our sites did not vary in pesticide exposure as expected. While we found a limited occurrence of neonicotinoids, two fungicides (azoxystrobin and difenoconazole) were detected at all sites, and the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was present in all 123 bees. We found that bumblebees that contained higher levels of PBO were less active, and this effect was stronger for larger bumblebee workers. While PBO is unlikely to be the direct cause of the reduction in bee activity, it could be an indicator of exposure to pyrethroids and/or other insecticides that we were unable to directly quantify, but which PBO is frequently tank-mixed with during pesticide applications on crops. We did not find a relationship between agrochemical exposure and bumblebee sucrose responsiveness.

Several potential contributing factors have been identified, and exposure to pesticides is of increasing concern. In maize fields, foraging bees are exposed to residual concentrations of insecticides such as neonicotinoids used for seed coating. Highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoids are also reported to increase AChE activity in other invertebrates exposed to sub-lethal doses. The purpose of this study was therefore to test if the honey bee's AChE activity could be altered by neonicotinoid compounds and to explore possible effects of other common products used in maize fields: atrazine and glyphosate. One week prior to pollen shedding, beehives were placed near three different field types: certified organically grown maize, conventionally grown maize or non-cultivated. At the same time, caged bees were exposed to increasing sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and clothianidin) and herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) under controlled conditions. While increased AChE activity was found in all fields after 2 weeks of exposure, bees close to conventional maize crops showed values higher than those in both organic maize fields and non-cultivated areas. In caged bees, AChE activity increased in response to neonicotinoids, and a slight decrease was observed by glyphosate.

Bee pollination is essential for fruit crops to guarantee maximal fruit quality (shape and size) and quantity (yield weight). Fruit growers in Belgium depend mostly on non-commercial beekeepers to provide sufficient colonies for adequate pollination. Under optimal circumstances, beekeepers and fruit growers have mutual benefits from this cooperation as both honey and fruit yield increase.

Both land-use stressors can have a variety of synergistic and sublethal effects on pollinators, affecting their health and foraging behaviour. Pollinating insects include species with vastly different life histories, giving them potentially different vulnerability and resilience to stressors. However, most research has generally focused on bees. Here, we contrast synergistic effects of nutritional stress and pesticide use on social bumblebees and solitary hoverflies. We experimentally tested the effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid and low-quality food on health traits of Bombus terrestris workers and Episyrphus balteatus adults (ovarian development, body size and colony development or survival). The foraging behaviour of treated pollinators was recorded in a semi-field setup and, for B. terrestris, we measured the pollen amount on the body surface and the pollen deposited on stigmata after a single floral visit. Both stressors affected bumblebee health. Additionally, insecticide-treated workers showed increased flower handling times and flight durations, while low-quality food reduced the amount of pollen on the surface of bumblebees and the pollen deposited on stigmata. Syrphids were mostly affected by low-quality food, which decreased their survival probability and changed their foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we found an interactive effect between the two stressors, reducing E. balteatus ovary development. Synthesis and applications. Insecticide and food stress affected fitness traits of both bumblebees and syrphid flies, possibly reducing pollinator populations under natural conditions. Especially for bumblebees, long-term exposure led to a reduction in the provision of pollination services, both by changing their behaviour and reducing pollen transfer. We found differences between the two pollinator groups, showing that results gained from single groups like bees should not be extrapolated to all pollinators. Interactive effects indicate potential buffering effects of high-quality food against other stressors and highlight the importance of considering synergies between multiple stressors in risk assessments. This further emphasizes the relevance of floral resources such as wild flower strips in agricultural areas to conserve pollinators and pollination services.

609,727,JOUR,Field rates of Sivanto‚Ñ¢ (flupyradifurone) and Transform¬Æ (sulfoxaflor) increase oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Chakrabarti, P.', 'Carlson, E.A.', 'Lucas, H.M.', 'Melathopoulos, A.P.', 'Sagili, R.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Pesticide exposures can have detrimental impacts on bee pollinators, ranging from immediate mortality to sub-lethal impacts. Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform¬Æ. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted‚Äîa shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and Transform¬Æ, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform¬Æ exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto‚Ñ¢, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. ¬© 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

137,942,JOUR,Pesticide residues and bees - A risk assessment,"['Sanchez-Bayo, F.', 'Goka, K.']",PLoS ONE,"Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees. ¬© 2014 Sanchez-Bayo, Goka.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0094482,9.0,4,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899582629&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0094482&partnerID=40&md5=4970f1b8f70b3cb3c7a0aceae4aeef18,Scopus,,0,residues,0,181

However, extensive residues of these pesticides in the soil, water, and pollen have negatively affected the health of nontarget organisms, especially among pollinators such as bumblebees. As an important pollinator, the bumblebee plays a vital role in agricultural production and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. Previous research has focused on the effects of a single pesticide on pollinating insects; however, the synergistic effects of multiple agents on bumblebees have been not studied in detail. Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos are three of common pesticides known for severe effects on bumblebee health. It is still unknown what synergistic effects of these pesticides on pollinators. In our test, the individual and combined toxicities of chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid to bumblebees after 48 h of oral administration were documented by the equivalent linear equation method. Our results showed that the toxicity of each single pesticide exposure, from high to low, was imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos. All binary and ternary combinations showed synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, our research not only shows that the mixed toxicity of insecticides has a significant effect on bumblebees, but also provides scientific guidelines for assessing the safety risks to bumblebees of these three insecticide compounds.

Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of sulfoxaflor and its effect on the A. mellifera exposure. RESULTS: Initially, developmental indicators such as larval survival, pupation, and eclosion were inhibited by 5.0 mg/L (field concentration) sulfoxaflor. In the pupal stage, fat content was significantly increased, while the glycogen content decreased. In addition, A. mellifera heads were treated with 2.0 mg/L (sublethal concentration) of sulfoxaflor and analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome results indicated that 2.0 mg/L amounts of sulfoxaflor have adverse effects on the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Sulfoxaflor down-regulated the expression of many genes involved in immunity, detoxification, the myosin cytoskeleton, sensory neurons, and odor-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: Field concentration and sublethal concentration were used for the combined analysis of honeybees. The effect of sublethal concentration of sulfoxaflor on honeybees was studied for the first time from the perspective of transcriptome sequencing of honeybee head. A preliminary study was carried out on the stress of sulfoxaflor at sublethal concentration on honeybee workers, which has certain research significance and can provide theoretical basis for the use of sulfoxaflor in the field environment. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024///,2024,10.1002/ps.8326,80.0,11,5941,5953,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'concentration (composition)', 'drug effect', 'genetic analysis', 'growth, development and aging', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'physiological response', 'pollution exposure', 'pupa', 'Pupa', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sublethal concentration', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'transcriptome', 'Transcriptome', 'transcriptome analysis']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202068976&doi=10.1002%2fps.8326&partnerID=40&md5=f1ac3cc696efcebed199af2d398beea4,Scopus,,0,,0,183
512,729,JOUR,Reduced species richness of native bees in field margins associated with neonicotinoid concentrations in non-target soils,"['Main, A.R.', 'Webb, E.B.', 'Goyne, K.W.', 'Mengel, D.']","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Native bees are in decline as many species are sensitive to habitat loss, climate change, and non-target exposure to synthetic pesticides. Recent laboratory and semi-field assessments of pesticide impacts on bees have focused on neonicotinoid insecticides. However, field studies evaluating influences of neonicotinoid seed treatments on native bee communities of North America are absent from the literature. On four Conservation Areas of Missouri, we sampled row-cropped (treated, n = 15) and reference (untreated, n = 9) agricultural fields, and their surrounding field margins for neonicotinoids in soil and non-target vegetation (i.e., native wildflowers). Wildflowers were further collected and screened for the presence of fungicides. Concurrently, we sampled native bees over three discrete time points throughout the agricultural growing season to assess potential impacts of seed treatment use on local bee populations over time. Neonicotinoids were detected in 87% to 100% of treated field soils and 22% to 56% of reference field soils. In adjacent field margin soils, quantifiable concentrations were measured near treated (53% to 93% detection) and untreated fields (33% to 56% detection). Fungicides were detected in < 40% of wildflowers, whereas neonicotinoids were rarely detected in field margin vegetation (< 7%). Neonicotinoid concentrations in margin soils were negatively associated with native bee richness (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.21, P < 0.05). Field margins with a combination of greater neonicotinoid concentrations in soil and fungicides in wildflowers also contained fewer wild bee species (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.21, P < 0.001). By comparison, bee abundance was positively influenced by the number of wildflower species in bloom with no apparent impact of pesticides. Results of this study indicate that neonicotinoids in soil are a potential route of exposure for pollinator communities, specifically ground-nesting species. Importantly, native bee richness in non-target field margins may be negatively affected by the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in agroecosystems. ¬© 2019",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106693,287.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073119095&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2019.106693&partnerID=40&md5=0bfbf3f855693a266ebf3b63d62d22a7,Scopus,,0,,0,184
270,417,JOUR,Diverse pollen nutrition can improve the development of solitary bees but does not mitigate negative pesticide impacts,"['Schwarz, J.M.', 'Knauer, A.C.', 'Alaux, C.', 'Barascou, L.', 'Barraud, A.', 'Dievart, V.', 'Ghazoul, J.', 'Michez, D.', 'Albrecht, M.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Floral resource loss and pesticide exposure are major threats to bees in intensively managed agroecosystems, but interactions among these drivers remain poorly understood. Altered composition and lowered diversity of pollen nutrition may reinforce negative pesticide impacts on bees. Here we investigated the development and survival of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis provisioned with three different pollen types, as well as a mixture of these types representing a higher pollen diversity. We exposed bees of each nutritional treatment to five pesticides at different concentrations in the laboratory. Two field-realistic concentrations of three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) modulating insecticides (thiacloprid, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone), as well as of two fungicides (azoxystrobin and tebuconazole) were examined. We further measured the expression of two detoxification genes (CYP9BU1, CYP9BU2) under exposure to thiacloprid across different nutrition treatments as a potential mechanistic pathway driving pesticide-nutrition interactions. We found that more diverse pollen nutrition reduced development time, enhanced pollen efficacy (cocoon weight divided by consumed pollen weight) and pollen consumption, and increased weight of O. bicornis after larval development (cocoon weight). Contrary to fungicides, high field-realistic concentrations of all three insecticides negatively affected O. bicornis by extending development times. Moreover, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone also reduced pollen efficacy and cocoon weight, and sulfoxaflor reduced pollen consumption and increased mortality. The expression of detoxification genes differed across pollen nutrition types, but was not enhanced after exposure to thiacloprid. Our findings highlight that lowered diversity of pollen nutrition and high field-realistic exposure to nAChR modulating insecticides negatively affected the development of O. bicornis, but we found no mitigation of negative pesticide impacts through increased pollen diversity. These results have important implications for risk assessment for bee pollinators, indicating that negative effects of nAChR modulating insecticides to developing solitary bees are currently underestimated. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169494,912.0,,,,,,"['4-Butyrolactone', 'Acetylcholine receptor', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bees', 'CYP9BU1 gene', 'CYP9BU2 gene', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'Detoxification gene', 'Detoxification gene expression', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental impact', 'flupyradifurone', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'gene', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes expression', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Interactive effect', 'Interactive effects', 'larval development', 'mortality rate', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'nutrition', 'Nutrition', 'nutritional assessment', 'Osmia bicorni', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'Pollen nutrition diversity', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Solitary bee development', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'tebuconazole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181078099&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.169494&partnerID=40&md5=45d2079d1a40c7b05b3d23abf4447373,Scopus,,0,,0,185
502,803,JOUR,Quantifying the impact of pesticides on learning and memory in bees,"['Siviter, H.', 'Koricheva, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Concern about the consequent impact on bees makes it important to understand their resilience. In the laboratory, the authors therefore fed adult worker bees on dosed syrup (125 Œºg L-1 of imidacloprid, or 98 Œºg kg-1) either continuously or as a pulsed exposure and measured their behaviour (feeding and locomotory activity) and whole-body residues. RESULTS: On dosed syrup, honey bees maintained much lower bodily levels of imidacloprid than bumblebees (<0.2 ng versus 2.4 ng of imidacloprid per bee). Dietary imidacloprid did not affect the behaviour of honey bees, but it reduced feeding and locomotory activity in bumblebees. After the pulsed exposure, bumblebees cleared bodily imidacloprid after 48 h and recovered behaviourally. CONCLUSION: The differential behavioural resilience of the two species can be attributed to the observed differential in bodily residues. The ability of bumblebees to recover may be environmentally relevant in wild populations that face transitory exposures from the pulsed blooming of mass-flowering crops. ¬© 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.",2014///,2014,10.1002/ps.3569,70.0,2,332,337,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892482969&doi=10.1002%2fps.3569&partnerID=40&md5=14d32ad468331b1ec5d0b122f0489294,Scopus,,0,,0,187

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. ¬© 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

168,443,JOUR,Impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumble bee energy metabolism are revealed under nectar starvation,"['Fischer, N.', 'Costa, C.P.', 'Hur, M.', 'Kirkwood, J.S.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bumble bees are an important group of insects that provide essential pollination services as a consequence of their foraging behaviors. These pollination services are driven, in part, by energetic exchanges between flowering plants and individual bees. Thus, it is important to examine bumble bee energy metabolism and explore how it might be influenced by external stressors contributing to declines in global pollinator populations. Two stressors that are commonly encountered by bees are insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, and nutritional stress, resulting from deficits in pollen and nectar availability. Our study uses a metabolomic approach to examine the effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on bumble bee metabolism, both alone and in combination with nutritional stress. We hypothesized that exposure to imidacloprid disrupts bumble bee energy metabolism, leading to changes in key metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. We tested this by exposing Bombus impatiens workers to imidacloprid according to one of three exposure paradigms designed to explore how chronic versus more acute (early or late) imidacloprid exposure influences energy metabolite levels, then also subjecting them to artificial nectar starvation. The strongest effects of imidacloprid were observed when bees also experienced nectar starvation, suggesting a combinatorial effect of neonicotinoids and nutritional stress on bumble bee energy metabolism. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on pollinators, and underscores the need for further investigation into the complex interactions between environmental stressors and energy metabolism. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169388,912.0,,,,,,"['angiosperm', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apidae', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus impatiens', 'Bumble bee', 'Bumble bees', 'bumblebee', 'carbon metabolism', 'Central carbon metabolisms', 'controlled study', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'Energy Metabolism', 'environmental stress', 'Flowering plants', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'Metabolism', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'metabolomics', 'Metabolomics', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'nutrient', 'nutrient dynamics', 'Nutrients', 'Nutritional stress', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticides', 'physiological stress', 'Plant Nectar', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'starvation']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181045872&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.169388&partnerID=40&md5=e96c410d5f834c615e3245a4c2e599e4,Scopus,,0,,0,189

We therefore tested the effects of a field-realistic FPF concentration (4 ppm, FPFdaily dose = 241 ¬± 4 ng/bee/day, 1/12 of LD50) and nutritional stress (nectar with low-sugar concentrations) on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mortality, food consumption, thermoregulation, flight success (unsuccessful vs. successful), and flight ability (duration, distance, velocity). Flight and thermoregulation are critical to colony health: bees fly to collect food and reproduce, and they thermoregulate to increase flight efficiency and to rear brood. We studied the effects across seasons because seasonality can influence bee sensitivity to environmental stress. We demonstrate that, depending upon season and nutritional stress, FPF can reduce bee survival (‚àí14%), food consumption (‚àí14%), thermoregulation (‚àí4%, i.e. hypothermia), flight success (‚àí19%), and increase flight velocity (+13%). Because pesticide exposure and nutritional stress can co-occur, we suggest that future studies and pesticide risk assessments consider both seasonality and nutritional stress when evaluating pesticide safety for bees. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124408,237.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069743427&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2019.124408&partnerID=40&md5=e9e153582dd1b9217a112bdec38fbf6c,Scopus,,0,,0,192
201,499,JOUR,Negative but antagonistic effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor on Apis mellifera honey bee food glands,"['Bruckner, S.', 'Straub, L.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Williams, G.R.']",Chemosphere,"Collaborative brood care by workers is essential for the functionality of eusocial Apis mellifera honey bee colonies. The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies. Therefore, our findings highlight the need to further study how ubiquitous stressors like V. destructor and neonicotinoids interact to affect honey bees. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137535,313.0,,,,,,"['Abiotic', 'abiotic factor', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'antagonism', 'Antagonism', 'antagonistic effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Biotic', 'Biotics', 'body mass', 'controlled study', 'ectoparasite', 'emergence', 'feeding behavior', 'female', 'Food products', 'honey', 'Honey', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'host parasite interaction', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Hypopharyngeal gland', 'Hypopharyngeal glands', 'hypopharynx', 'inclusive fitness', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'mite', 'Mites', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'organ size', 'Parasite', 'parasite survival', 'Parasite-', 'parasitism', 'pollution exposure', 'Stressor interaction', 'Stressor interactions', 'Varroa destructor', 'Varroidae', ""Workers'""]",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144613712&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.137535&partnerID=40&md5=a31e7a9ca2d4e9ea94142b689c6df604,Scopus,,0,,0,193

Additional groups of bees were challenged with Nosema infections or with combinations of the pesticide and pathogens. Longevity and flight activity of the differentially treated bees were monitored for a period of 18 days. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, no effect of the neonicotinoid treatment on mortality or flight activity could be observed.

In recent decades pollinator declines have been linked to the effects of increased pesticide use and the spread of disease. Synergy between these factors has been suggested, but no physiological mechanism has been identified. This study examines the connection between neonicotinoid exposure and innate immune function in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens, which is an important wild and commercial pollinator in eastern North America. Experimental colonies in the field were enclosed and provided pollen and sugar syrup containing an agriculturally relevant range of imidacloprid concentrations. Bumblebees were collected from colonies over four weeks, and the expression of antimicrobial peptides was measured using multiplex quantitative real time PCR. Significant increases in the expression of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptaecin were found over time in treatments receiving moderate to high concentrations of the pesticide. Responses were dependent on time of exposure and dose. These results indicate that immune function in bumblebees is affected by neonicotinoid exposure and suggest a physiological mechanism by which neonicotinoids may impact the innate immune function of bumblebee pollinators in wild and agricultural habitats. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/srep44773,7.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015815840&doi=10.1038%2fsrep44773&partnerID=40&md5=8d004ab4ba922c574bb423d32da67241,Scopus,,0,,0,196

For instance, neurotoxic insecticide compounds in food could affect central nervous system development predisposing individuals to become poorer task performers later-in-life. Studying bumblebee colonies provisioned with neonicotinoid spiked nectar substitute, we measured brain volume and learning behaviour of 3 or 12-day old adults that had experienced in-hive exposure during brood and/or early-stage adult development. Micro-computed tomography scanning and segmentation of multiple brain neuropils showed exposure during either of the developmental stages caused reduced mushroom body calycal growth relative to unexposed workers. Associated with this was a lower probability of responding to a sucrose reward and lower learning performance in an olfactory conditioning test. While calycal volume of control workers positively correlated with learning score, this relationship was absent for exposed workers indicating neuropil functional impairment. Comparison of 3- and 12-day adults exposed during brood development showed a similar degree of reduced calycal volume and impaired behaviour highlighting lasting and irrecoverable effects from exposure despite no adult exposure.

181,445,JOUR,Chronic acetamiprid exposure moderately affects the foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),"['T√≥th, Z.', 'Kov√°cs, Z.']",Ethology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators in both natural and agricultural ecosystems, but their survival and pollination service are threatened by extensive pesticide use. Due to regulation changes, acetamiprid has become the only neonicotinoid substance that can be used without restrictions and in open-field cultivations in the European Union. Yet, we know little about how this active ingredient affects bumblebees' foraging behaviour and if such effects are similarly detrimental to those of other neonicotinoids. Here we investigated how a 14-day-long (chronic) exposure to low (5 ppb) and high (2500 ppb) concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup affected different aspects of foraging behaviour in buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus). We recorded individual foraging at artificial food patches during one-hour-long trials and then compared several foraging-related measures between differently dosed individuals. We found that 75.12% of the total syrup consumption occurred at the first-exploited patch, but individuals did not exhibit any bias toward pesticide-treated food patches. Chronic exposure to acetamiprid had little effect on individual foraging decisions at the first-exploited food patch but significantly affected the time to the first feeding and the number of feedings at the second-exploited patch in interaction with body mass. The duration of the first feeding was affected only by foragers' body mass. Our finding indicates that chronic exposure to a high but field-realistic concentration of acetamiprid may alter some aspects of bumblebees' foraging behaviour. If such behavioural changes accumulate during consecutive foraging bouts, chronic exposure to this pesticide might lead to a reduction of daily resource collection, ultimately jeopardising colony fitness or plant (crop) pollination. ¬© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory. RESULTS: We developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24 h) and B. terrestris (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. ¬© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2016 Society of Chemical Industry",2017///,2017,10.1002/ps.4449,73.0,6,1236,1243,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006314459&doi=10.1002%2fps.4449&partnerID=40&md5=1fb3bfcbc105952ff4abfb3ac370d3e6,Scopus,,0,,0,199

The overall weight of evidence indicates that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to IMI from its use as a seed treatment. Exposures via dusts from currently used seed coatings present a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure is via uptake in plants that are a source of pollen or nectar for honeybees. There were few higher-tier observational (ecoepidemiological) studies conducted with IMI. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable, but the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion‚Äìthat IMI had no adverse effects on viability of the honeybee colony.

They also conduct pollination, an ecosystem service of high importance to both wild plants and entomophilous crops. Insecticides can alter different aspects of bumblebee foraging behavior, including the motivation to leave the hive, finding the right flowers, handling flowers, and the ability to return to the colony. In the present study, we assessed how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid affects bumblebees' foraging behavior after exposure to four different treatment levels, including field-realistic concentrations (0 [control], 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L), through sucrose solution over 9 days. We observed the behavior of several free-flying bumblebees simultaneously foraging on artificial flowers in a flight arena to register the bees' complex behavior postexposure. To conduct a detailed assessment of how insecticides affect bumblebee locomotor behavior, we used video cameras and analyzed the recordings using computer vision. We found that imidacloprid impaired learning and locomotor activity level when the bumblebees foraged on artificial flowers. We also found that imidacloprid exposure reduced sucrose solution intake and storage. By using automated analyses of video recordings of bumblebee behavior, we identified sublethal effects of imidacloprid exposure at field-realistic doses. Specifically, we observed negative impacts on consumption of sucrose solution as well as on learning and locomotor activity level.

The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 Œºg active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. ¬© 2012 Tom√© et al.",2012///,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0038406,7.0,6,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861849676&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0038406&partnerID=40&md5=c79d1d494822feae704376b9953a9f04,Scopus,,0,,0,202

Critically, we know little about the magnitude and sources of risk to honeybees compared with other bees during crop pollination. To compare pesticide exposure and risk across wild and managed bees, we sampled the main bee groups present during bloom in 20 apple orchards, including managed honeybees (Apis mellifera), managed bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens), wild mining bees (Andrena spp. and Andrena [Melandrena] spp.), bumblebee foundress queens (Bombus impatiens) and eastern carpenter bees (Xylocopa virginica). We screened all bees for 92 pesticides and computed a Risk Quotient using available toxicity data (honeybee LD50s), adjusting for differences in toxicity known to scale with body mass. To gain insight into exposure origin, we compared residues in bees to those in focal orchard apple and dandelion flowers. Nearly all bee samples contained pesticides (95%), with the average contamination level ranging from 7.1 ¬± 2.8 parts per billion (ppb) in B. impatiens workers to 388.4 ¬± 146.2 ppb in Andrena. Exposure profiles were similar for all bees except A. mellifera, whose unique exposure profile included high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam. All bee groups except wild B. impatiens queens had at least one sample exceeding a US Environmental Protection Agency or European Food Safety Authority exposure level of concern. Apis mellifera experienced significantly greater risk than other bee groups, with 63% and 81% of samples exceeding an acute or chronic exposure level of concern, respectively. Risk to honeybees was driven primarily by high thiamethoxam levels not found in focal orchard flowers and likely originating outside the orchard. Synthesis and applications: We find that pesticide exposure and risk differ between honeybees and other managed and wild bees during apple pollination. Furthermore, pesticide exposure is a landscape-scale phenomenon and therefore measures to reduce exposure must consider the surroundings beyond focal farms. Limiting orchard sprays, while reducing on-farm exposures, will not protect far-foraging bees from off-farm exposures such as thiamethoxam, which we hypothesize is coming from nearby seed-treated corn fields planted during apple bloom. ¬© 2024 The Authors.

Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. ¬© 2016 D√©mares et al.

Besides increasing landscape fragmentation that limit the supply of flower resources, intensive agricultural practices relying on the use of pesticides to control agricultural pests also affect non-target organisms like honey bees. The use of most pesticides containing neonicotinoids has been severely restricted in the European Union, leaving pesticides containing acetamiprid as the only ones that are still authorized. In the meantime, new substances like sulfoxaflor, that have a similar mode of action acting on the insect's nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), have been approved for agricultural use. In Europe and USA, the use of pesticides containing this active ingredient is limited due to toxic effects already reported on bees, but no restrictions regarding this matter were applied in other countries (e.g., Brazil). In this study, homing ability tests with acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor were performed, in which honey bees were fed with three sub-lethal doses from each substance. After exposure, each honey bee was equipped with an RFID chip and released 1 km away from the colony to evaluate their homing ability. No significant effects were detected in honey bees fed with 32, 48 and 61 ng of acetamiprid while a poor performance on their homing ability, with only 28% of them reaching the colony instead of 75%, was detected at a 26 ng/a.s./bee dose of sulfoxaflor. Although, both pesticides act on the nAChR, the higher sulfoxaflor toxicity might be related with the honey bees detoxifying mechanisms, which are more effective on cyano-based neonicotinoids (i.e., acetamiprid) than sulfoximines. With this study we encourage the use of homing ability tests to be a suitable candidate to integrate the future risk assessment scheme, providing valuable data to models predicting effects on colony health that emerge from the individual actions of each bee. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155710,837.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetylcholine receptor', 'agricultural intensification', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis melifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Europe', 'experimental study', 'Field experiment', 'Field experiments', 'Food products', 'Health risks', 'homing behavior', 'Homing failure', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lethal dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population exposure', 'prediction', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'radiofrequency identification', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'unclassified drug', 'United States']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130185757&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.155710&partnerID=40&md5=ff6f430cc716ab62cc8cba0390be93e9,Scopus,,0,,0,205

Therefore, new compounds, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), have recently been developed as 'safer' alternatives. FPF is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, similar to neonicotinoids. Given the novelty of FPF, what data exist are focused mostly on assessing the effect of FPF on pollinator mortality. One important avenue for investigation is the potential effect of FPF on the sensitivity of nectar foragers, such as Apis mellifera, to sucrose concentrations. Neonicotinoids can alter this sucrose responsiveness and disrupt foraging. Compounding this effect, neonicotinoid-containing solutions are preferred by A. mellifera over pure sucrose solutions. We therefore conducted four studies, administering FPF under both acute and chronic conditions, and at field-realistic and higher than field-realistic doses, to assess the influence of FPF exposure on sucrose responsiveness and sucrose solutions with FPF in A. mellifera nectar foragers. RESULTS We found no evidence that FPF exposure under acute or chronic field-realistic conditions significantly altered sucrose responsiveness, and we did not find that bees exposed to FPF consumed more of the solution. However, at the much higher median lethal dose (48 h), among bees that survived, FPF-exposed foragers responded to significantly lower concentrations of sucrose than controls and responded at significantly higher rates to all concentrations of sucrose than controls. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that FPF alters the sucrose responsiveness of nectar foragers at field-realistic doses during winter or early spring, but caution and further investigation are warranted, particularly on the effects of FPF in conjunction with other stressors.

For example, bees visiting a flowering crop may be chronically exposed to low concentrations of systemic insecticides applied before bloom and then to a pulse of fungicide, considered safe for bees, applied during bloom. In this study, we simulate this scenario under laboratory conditions with females of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis L. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide, Confidor¬Æ (imidacloprid) at a realistic concentration, and of a pulse (1¬†day) exposure of the fungicide Folicur¬Æ SE (tebuconazole) at field application rate. Syrup consumption, survival, and four biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were evaluated at two different time points. An integrated biological response (IBRv2) index was elaborated with the biomarker results. The fungicide pulse had no impact on survival but temporarily reduced syrup consumption and increased the IBRv2 index, indicating potential molecular alterations. The neonicotinoid significantly reduced syrup consumption, survival, and the neurological activity of the enzymes. The co-exposure neonicotinoid-fungicide did not increase toxicity at the tested concentrations. AChE proved to be an efficient biomarker for the detection of early effects for both the insecticide and the fungicide.

In the eusocial Hymenoptera, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of male sexuals (drones) and efficient collaborative brood care by female workers. Therefore, sublethal insecticide effects on sperm and glands used in larval feeding (hypopharyngeal glands (HPG)) would provide key mechanisms for population declines in eusocial insects. However, while negative impacts for bumblebee colony fitness have been documented, the effects of insecticide exposure on individual physiology are less well understood. Here, we show that field-realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam significantly impair Bombus terrestris sperm and HPGs, thereby providing plausible mechanisms underlying bumblebee population decline. In the laboratory, drones and workers were exposed to five thiamethoxam concentrations (4.5 to 1000 ng ml(-1)). Then, survival, food consumption, body mass, HPG development, sperm quantity and viability were assessed. At all concentrations, drones were more exposed than workers due to higher food consumption. Increased body mass was observed in drones starting at 20 ng ml(-1) and in workers at 100 ng ml(-1). Furthermore, environmentally realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) did not significantly affect survival or consumption for either sex. However, thiamethoxam exposure significantly negatively affected both spermviability and HPG development at all tested concentrations. Therefore, the results indicate a trade-off between survival and fitness components, possibly due to costly detoxification. Since sperm and HPG are corner stones of colony fitness, the data offer plausible mechanisms for bumblebee population declines. To adequately mitigate ongoing biodiversity declines for the eusocial insects, this study suggests it is essential to evaluate the impact of insecticides on fitness parameters of both sexuals and workers.

Increased insecticide use and the introduction of new insecticide classes have been proposed as factors contributing to these declines. Previous studies have demonstrated contact toxicity of single active ingredient insecticides to honey bees. However, the field realistic contact toxicity of formulated (pre-mix) insecticide mixtures containing multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to honey bees has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we simulate whole body contact to spray applications made at low label recommended field rates of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram to honey bees under three realistic scenarios in field crops: (1) continuous exposure, (2) spray-only exposure, and (3) residual exposure. A customized spray tower in a laboratory setting was used to apply insecticides at the lowest recommended dose in the Environmental Protection Agency regulated label of each insecticide. Acute toxicity was determined by screening resulting mortality up to 96-hours post treatment. Mortality varied significantly between treatments at all evaluation periods for all experiments except residual exposure. For continuous and spray-only exposure, thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin resulted in 80‚Äì90% mortality at 48-hours, while at 96-hours we observed close to complete mortality for all treatments. This difference in mortality onset between treatments highlights the importance of extended observation beyond the 48-hours recommended by the USDA-EPA. Our finding of overall high mortality demonstrates the importance of comparing both combined and individual active ingredients in determining insecticide risk to honey bees. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envc.2021.100408,6.0,,,,,,"['Honey bees', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Premix insecticides', 'Pyrethroids', 'Residual toxicity', 'Toxicity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121971627&doi=10.1016%2fj.envc.2021.100408&partnerID=40&md5=307e0fa6bd4fd2981a4bd75f8f1aa83c,Scopus,,0,,0,210

However, potential long-lasting or delayed effects resulting from an acute exposure (e.g. a single dose) are often overlooked, although the modification of a developmental process may have life-long consequences. To investigate this question, we exposed young honeybee workers to a single sublethal field-realistic dose of a neurotoxic pesticide, sulfoxaflor, at one of two amounts (16 or 60 ng), at the moment when they initiated orientation flights (preceding foraging activity). We then tracked in the field their flight activity and lifespan with automated life-long monitoring devices. Both amounts of sulfoxaflor administered reduced the total number of flights but did not affect bee survival and flight duration. When looking at the time series of flight activity, effects were not immediate but delayed until foraging activity with a decrease in the daily number of foraging flights and consequently in their total number (24 and 33% less for the 16 and 60 ng doses, respectively). The results of our study therefore blur the general assumption in honeybee toxicology that acute exposure results in immediate and rapid effects and call for long-term recording and/or time-to-effect measurements, even upon exposure to a single dose of pesticide. ¬© 2021",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150351,805.0,,,,,,"['Acute exposure', 'Acute toxicity', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee', 'Bees', 'biological monitoring', 'clinical assessment', 'comparative study', 'controlled study', 'Delayed effects', 'developmental process', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'experimental study', 'flight', 'flight activity', 'Flight activity', 'foraging', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'image analysis', 'immunocompetence', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'nectar', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxin', 'nonhuman', 'normal distribution', 'orientation', 'pesticide', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'pollen allergy', 'practice guideline', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'short term exposure', 'Single-dose', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'sucrose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival analysis', 'survival rate', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114984109&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.150351&partnerID=40&md5=88cf178a7d135cd1894a0f2a45089ecb,Scopus,,0,,0,211

Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses.

We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 Œºg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 Œºg/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 Œºg/L and 40 Œºg/L imidacloprid. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee decision-making and other advanced cognitive functions should be explored.

Much of what is known about the non-target effects on bees comes from oral exposure in eusocial species. However, most bee species are solitary and nest below ground. For them, contaminated nesting resources may represent an important, yet understudied, route of exposure. We examined the effect of chronic contact exposure with realistic soil concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (0, 7.5, 15, or 100 ppb) during immature development on adult locomotion (movement speed and distance) and brain development of the solitary bees Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata. Adult locomotion and mushroom body morphology were characterized 2 (females) or 4 (males) and 14 (both sexes) days after emergence. Unlike the 0 and 7.5 ppb groups, female O. lignaria treated with 15 and 100 ppb did not move faster with age. If movement speed is associated with foraging or nest-building ability, this could result in a 25% reduction in nest provisioning efficiency over the first 14 days. Young male M. rotundata moved more quickly (7.5 and 100 ppb) and farther (100 ppb) when treated with imidacloprid, potentially increasing their ability to compete for more receptive female bees. We did not detect an effect of imidacloprid on the relative volumes of the neuropil and Kenyon cell subregions. We discuss how an environmentally persistent xenobiotic has the potential to alter population dynamics through changes in adult locomotion, even in the absence of a detectable effect on gross brain morphology. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131177,283.0,,,,,,"['adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'Basidiomycota', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Biochemistry', 'biological development', 'brain development', 'Chronic contact', 'competitive ability', 'Competitive ability', 'controlled study', 'female', 'Female', 'foraging', 'foraging behavior', 'Hexapoda', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'kenyon cell', 'locomotion', 'long term exposure', 'male', 'Male', 'Megachile rotundata', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'Movement', 'Movement speed', 'Mushroom bodies', 'mushroom body', 'Mushroom body', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nesting', 'Nesting resource', 'Nesting resources', 'neuropil', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Non-target effects', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'population dynamics', 'soil', 'Soil', 'Solitary bee', 'velocity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108001289&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2021.131177&partnerID=40&md5=008549debd2fcf0831c30c7a7d8f4b72,Scopus,,0,,0,216

The higher exposure level caused severe acute symptoms, due to which we were not able to test the learning and memory. Conclusions: Our results show that oral exposure to a thiacloprid-based pesticide, calculated based on residue levels found in pollen and nectar, not only causes sublethal effects but also acute lethal effects on bumble bees. Our study underlines an urgent demand for better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment, and of the effects of those residue levels on pollinators. These findings fill the gap in the existing knowledge and help the scientific community and policymakers to enhance the sustainable use of pesticides. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).",2023///,2023,10.1186/s12862-023-02111-3,23.0,1,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Associative learning', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus terrestris', 'Bumble bee', 'cognition', 'Cognition', 'Insecticide exposure', 'learning', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticide Residues', 'Pesticides', 'Plant Nectar', 'poisoning', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'symptom', 'thiacloprid']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151802068&doi=10.1186%2fs12862-023-02111-3&partnerID=40&md5=b146ce99874dc114991c5900e71c6e34,Scopus,,0,,0,217

However, in cultivated areas, they can be exposed to the chemicals utilized for crop protection. Neonicotinoid insecticides can adversely affect honey bee colonies impairing their survival, immunity and biological activities at lethal and sublethal doses. For this reason, neonicotinoids, together with other stress factors, like pathogens (e.g. viruses and Varroa mites), climate change and food shortage, are considered one of the causes of worldwide colony losses. Nevertheless, the natural way of entry and diffusion of these pesticides in field colonies is not completely clear. Here, we wanted to fill this gap by studying the diffusion route of imidacloprid and its metabolites by analysing different matrices collected from honey bee colonies used for pollination of apple orchards, in the framework of applied Integrated Pest Management strategies. Pollen, honey bees, honey, royal jelly, bee wax and bee bread were sampled from 6 honey bee colonies placed in two different apple orchards before blooming, exposed to chemicals application and removed from the site after that. Samples were analysed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in order to detect imidacloprid, olefin im-idacloprid and 5-hydroxy imidacloprid. The results demonstrate that the primary way of entrance of imidacloprid was the pollen transported by foragers, while the main accumulation matrices were bee bread, honey and wax. These findings allow us to hypoth-esize that the accumulation of this insecticide, especially in bee bread, the main larval food, could potentially impact negatively on honey bee wellbeing at the adult stage. Moreover, our data could implement the honey bee colony simulator. ¬© 2023, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Tackling this challenge is, however, necessary to establish their negative side effects on these pollinators. For instance, it is still under debate the mechanism by which bees seem to recognize low-level contaminations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar and pollen of the flowers they visit and limit collection to protect themselves and their hive from a possible intoxication. In this study, we propose an experimental system that involves the use of foragers in free flight foraging repeatedly on artificial feeders containing a sucrose solution contaminated with clothianidin, as well as foragers feeding at adjacent control feeders, allowing us to observe changes in their foraging activity. The progressive disappearance of foragers from the contaminated feeders became increasingly clear and rapid with the increase in clothianidin concentration. The lowest concentration at which we observed an effect was around 10 mu g/L, which corresponds to the maximum residual concentration (10 ng/g) observed in pollen and nectar of flowers close to open fields sown with seeds coated with insecticides. At the highest concentrations tested (80 mu g/L), there was an almost total abandonment of the feeders. The estimated quantity of contaminated sucrose solution collected by foragers showed an almost linear relationship inversely proportional to clothianidin concentration, whilst the estimated quantity of insecticide collected by a forager increased and then stabilised at the highest concentrations tested of 40 and 80 mu g/L. Irregular mortality was not observed in front of the hives, furthermore, foragers did not show evident memory of the position of the treated units in the trials on the 2 consecutive days. The decrease in foraging activity in the presence of a few mu g/L of insecticide in the sucrose solution appears to limit the introduction of elevated amounts of toxic substances into the hives, which would have serious consequences for the young bees and the brood. At the same time, in the absence of an alternative energy source, even reduced feeding of the hive can compromise colony health.",2023/01//undefined,2023,10.1007/s11356-022-22977-y,30.0,5,12257,12268,0944-1344,WOS:000854721900010,"['alternative energy', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'clothianidin', 'Clothianidin toxicity', 'concentration (composition)', 'dietary intake', 'fly', 'Foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee behaviour', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'mortality', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'phytotoxicity', 'Plant Nectar', 'Sub-lethal doses', 'sublethal effect', 'sucrose', 'Sucrose', 'toxicity']",,,,,,0,,0,219

Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0¬†ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects. We found 678 genes differentially expressed under both imidacloprid exposures relative to controls, including mitochondrial activity, development, and DNA replication genes. However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure; uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results. A smaller differentially expressed set only in lower concentration larvae, included neural development and cell growth genes. Our findings show varying molecular consequences under different field-realistic neonicotinoid concentrations, and that even low concentrations may affect fundamental biological processes. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).",2023///,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-36232-y,13.0,1,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'gene expression', 'Gene Expression', 'genetics', 'imidacloprid', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163073015&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-36232-y&partnerID=40&md5=f5069c8d635fec9783e72eda798cf54e,Scopus,,0,,0,220

Although most studies have investigated insecticide residues in honeybees and bumblebees, few have focused on non-Apis solitary bees, which are considered essential pollinators in the field. Most non-Apis bees are solitary and build their nests in the ground or in tree holes, therefore insecticide exposure pathways would differ from those of honeybees and bumblebees. We analyzed the residues of 20 insecticides in Osmia cornifrons bees and their pollen-provisions and nesting materials, along with adult honeybees, soil, and wildflowers collected in four apple orchards in two regions in Japan. Few insecticides were common among adult bees, pollen-provisions, and wildflowers. Insecticides applied in orchards were detected at high frequency: chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide, and diazinon were detected in almost all samples. Insecticides without a known history of application were detected from various samples at frequencies ranging from 0% to 100%. Even in orchards without a known history of insecticide application, clothianidin was detected in many sample types and at high concentration. A purple deadnettle sample had the highest concentration at 17.5 mg/kg. These results highlight the complexity of pathways of insecticide exposure to O. cornifrons in the environment because insecticides may remain in the environment for long periods and wild bees may forage farther than previously known distances. Furthermore, each sample type contained different insecticides, so wild bees may have been exposed to different insecticides at different life stages. Future research should prioritize wide-scale measurements of insecticide residues in field conditions and toxicity testing with multiple exposures at different life stages of target species.

In this study, we investigated residues in nine colonies at a model agricultural research site during the period before wintering. Moreover, we applied the acaricide tau-fluvalinate to the colonies via a strip formulation. The pesticide content was determined by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in bees from brood comb initially collected in mid-September immediately prior to the start of tau-fluvalinate treatment and 30 later at the time of tau-fluvalinate strip removal. RESULTS: In addition to commonly analyzed pesticides, we detected two plant growth regulators, chlormequat and metazachlor, in the bee colonies. Whereas thiacloprid, chlormequat and acetamiprid decreased after 30 days and contributed considerably to differences between sample time points, other pesticides appeared to be rather stable. Interestingly, we identified diazinon, which has been banned in the European Union since 2007. The residues of methiocarb sulfoxide and imidacloprid-urea in the absence of their parent compounds indicate historical environmental contamination that can be identified by the detection of residues in a bee colony. tau-Fluvalinate was detected only after the 30-day treatment at an average (¬± SD) concentration of 1.29 ¬± 1.93 ng/bee, ranging from 0.06 to 7.13 ng/bee. CONCLUSION: The multidimensional behavior of pesticides in a bee colony was indicated. Although the research area is used for agriculture, the measured pesticide level was relatively low.

Acetamiprid is a new class of insecticide and a member of the neonicotinoids that has been widely applied in the field for pest control. However, effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on worker bees are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on lifespan and memory-related characteristics. Newly emerged worker bees from a single colony were randomly divided into four groups, and this experiment was repeated three times using three different colonies. Three doses (0.5, 1, and 2¬†Œºg/bee) of acetamiprid diluted by water were added on the thorax of worker bees while bees were exposed to pure water as a control (0¬†Œºg/bee). The lifespan of bees treated with acetamiprid at a concentration over 1¬†Œºg/bee was significantly reduced, while there was no significant difference between the 0.5¬†Œºg/bee group and 0¬†Œºg/bee group. All three doses of acetamiprid affected the memory-related characteristics of bees, reduced the success of proboscis extension response (PER), affected homing ability, and influenced expression levels of two learning- and memory-related genes compared with the control group.

Here, we first investigated the metabolisation kinetics of thiamethoxam in chronically fed honeybees. We show that thiamethoxam, at a dose of 0.25 ng/bee/day, is quickly and effectively metabolised into clothianidin, throughout a 20 day exposure period. Using a similar chronic exposure to pesticide, we then studied, in a separate experiment, the impact of thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) co-exposure in honeybees. The honeybees were exposed to the virus by contact, mimicking the natural transmission route in the hive. We demonstrate that a high dose of thiamethoxam (5.0 ng/bee/day) can cause a synergistic increase in mortality in co-exposed honeybees after 8 to 10 days of exposure, with no increase in viral loads. At a lower dose (2.5 ng/bee/day), there was no synergistic increase of mortality, but viral loads were significantly higher in naturally dead honeybees, compared with sacrificed honeybees exposed to the same conditions. These results show that the interactions between pathogens and pesticides in honeybees can be complex: increasing pesticide doses may not necessarily be linked to a rise in viral loads, suggesting that honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might change with pesticide exposure. ¬© 2017 The Authors",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.10.009,144.0,,10,18,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032947686&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2017.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=bbc1f6310fbf6616ceff7aef1bb8dca8,Scopus,,0,,0,224

Sometimes, a simultaneous action of multiple stressors, natural and chemical, results in even greater effect than of any stressor alone. Therefore, integrative investigations of different factors affecting honey bees have to be carried out. In this study, adult honey bees exposed to thiamethoxam in larval and/or adult stage and infected with Nosema ceranae were examined. Newly emerged bees from colonies, non-treated or treated with thiamethoxam, were organized in six groups and kept in cages. Thiamethoxam treated bees were further exposed to either thiamethoxam or Nosema (groups TT and TN), or simultaneously to both (group TTN). Newly emerged bees from non-treated colonies were exposed to Nosema (group CN). From both, treated and non-treated colonies two groups were organized and further fed only with sugar solution (groups C and TC). Here, we present the expression profile of 19 genes in adult worker honey bees comprising those involved in immune, detoxification, development and apoptosis response. Results showed that gene expression patterns changed with time and depended on the treatment. In group TC at the time of emergence the majority of tested genes were downregulated, among which nine were significantly altered. The same gene pattern was observed on day six, where the only significantly upregulated gene was defensin-1. On day nine most of analyzed genes in all experimental groups showed upregulation compared to control group, where upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes abaecin, defensin-1 and defensin-2 was significant in groups TT and TTN. On day 15 we observed a similar pattern of expression in groups TC and TT exposed to thiamethoxam only, where most of the detoxification genes were downregulated.

In social insects, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of reproductives, i.e. males and queens, and efficient collaborative brood care by workers. Therefore, interactive effects between malnutrition and environmental pollution on sperm and feeding glands (hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs)) would provide mechanisms for population declines, unless buffered against due to their fitness relevance. However, while negative effects for bumble bee colony fitness are known, the effects of malnutrition and insecticide exposure singly and in combination on individuals are poorly understood. Here we show, in a fully-crossed laboratory experiment, that malnutrition and insecticide exposure result in neutral or antagonistic interactions for spermatozoa and HPGs of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, suggesting strong selection to buffer key colony fitness components. No significant effects were observed for mortality and consumption, but significant negative effects were revealed for spermatozoa traits and HPGs. The combined effects on these parameters were not higher than the individual stressor effects, which indicates an antagonistic interaction between both. Despite the clear potential for additive effects, due to the individual stressors impairing muscle quality and neurological control, simultaneous malnutrition and insecticide exposure surprisingly did not reveal an increased impact compared to individual stressors, probably due to key fitness traits being resilient.

The abundance and diversity of honeybees have been rapidly diminishing, possibly related to the extensive use of insecticides in ecosystems. Sulfoxaflor is a novel sulfoximine insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. However, few studies have addressed the negative effects of sulfoxaflor on honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, adult workers were fed a 50% (w/v) of sugar solution containing different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor for two weeks consecutively. The survival rates, food intake, and body weight of the honeybees significantly decreased after continuous exposure at higher doses (0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor when compared with the control. The change in the metabolites in the honeybee gut was determined using high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics on day 14 after sulfoxaflor treatment. The results revealed that 24 and 105 metabolites changed after exposure to 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L sulfoxaflor, respectively, compared with that of the control groups.

147,317,JOUR,"Exposure to the novel insecticide flupyradifurone impairs bumblebee feeding motivation, learning, and memory retention","['Siviter, H', 'Muth, F']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"Bees are vital pollinators of crops and wildflowers and as such, wild bee declines threaten food security and functioning ecosystems. One driver of bee declines is the use of systemic insecticides, such as commonly used neonicotinoids. However, rising pest resistance to neonicotinoids, and restrictions on their use in the EU, has increased the demand for replacement insecticides to control crop pests. Flupyradifurone is a novel systemic insecticide that is thought to be relatively 'bee safe' although it can be present in the nectar and pollen of bee-attractive crops. Bumblebees rely on learning to forage efficiently, and thus detriments to learning performance may have downstream consequences on their ability to forage. While neonicotinoids negatively influence bumblebee learning and memory, whether this is also the case for their replacements is unclear. Here, we exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of flupyradifurone before training them to learn either an olfactory or colour association. We found that flupyradifurone impaired bumblebees' learning and memory performance in both olfactory and visual modalities. Flupyradifurone-treated bees were also less motivated to feed. Given the similarity between the detriments to cognition found here and those previously reported for neonicotinoids, this implies that these insecticides may have similar sub-lethal effects on bees. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use are therefore unlikely to benefit bees if novel insecticides like flupyradifurone are used as an alternative, highlighting that current agrochemical risk assessments are not protecting bees from the unwanted consequences of pesticide use. Sub-lethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory in agrochemical regulation to ensure that novel insecticides are indeed 'bee safe'.",2022/08/15/,2022,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119575,307.0,,,,0269-7491,WOS:000811640700001,"['4-Butyrolactone', 'absorption', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agricultural chemistry', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body size', 'bumblebee', 'chemical pollutant', 'cognition', 'Cognition', 'color', 'Color learning', 'Colour learning', 'controlled study', 'Crops', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'environmental assessment', 'environmental exposure', 'flupyradifurone', 'Food supply', 'foraging behavior', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning and memory', 'learning disorder', 'Learning performance', 'Learning retention', 'memory consolidation', 'memory disorder', 'Memory retention', 'motivation', 'Motivation', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Olfactory learning', 'olfactory memory', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Sub-lethal', 'sublethal effect', 'unclassified drug', 'vision']",,,,,,0,,0,229

Larvae were exposed singly and in combination to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and three sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin to evaluate their effects on survivorship, weight, haemocyte counts, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression of the adult bees that subsequently developed. Clothianidin significantly reduced bee weight at the highest dose and was associated with an increase in haemocyte counts at the lowest dose, whereas V. destructor parasitism increased DWV levels, reduced bee emergence, lowered weight and reduced haemocyte counts. An interaction between the two stressors was observed for weight at emergence. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), V. destructor infestation resulted in broader down-regulatory effects related to immunity that was often shared with the combined stressors, while clothianidin resulted in a broader up-regulatory effect more related to central metabolic pathways that was often shared with the combined stressors.

While it is known that nectar and pollen provide macronutrients, flowers also contain secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that impart benefits including increased longevity, improved gut microbiome abundance, and pathogen tolerance. Our study aims to understand the role of phytochemicals in pesticide tolerance when worker bees were fed with sublethal doses (1 ppb and 10 ppb) of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, in 20% (w/v) sugar solution supplemented with 25 ppm of phytochemicals - caffeine, kaempferol, gallic acid, or p-coumaric acid, previously shown to have beneficial impacts on bee health. The effect of phytochemical supplementation during pesticide exposure was context-dependent. With 1 ppb TMX, phytochemical supplementation increased longevity but at 10 ppb TMX, longevity was reduced suggesting a negative synergistic effect. Phytochemicals mixed with 1 ppb TMX increased mortality in bees of the forager-age group but with 10 ppb TMX, mortality of the inhive-age group increased, implying the possibility of accumulation effect in lower sublethal doses. Given that the phytochemical composition of pollen and nectar varies between plant species, we suggest that the negative impacts of agrochemicals on honey bees could vary based on the phytochemicals in pollen and nectar of that crop, and hence the effects may vary across crops. Analyzing the phytochemical composition for individual crops may be a necessary first step prior to determining the appropriate dosage of agrochemicals so that harm to bees Apis mellifera L. is minimized while crop pests are effectively controlled. ¬© 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2021///,2021,10.1093/jisesa/ieab053,21.0,4,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'caffeine', 'Caffeine', 'coumaric acid', 'Coumaric Acids', 'dietary supplement', 'Dietary Supplements', 'gallic acid', 'Gallic Acid', 'honey bee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'kaempferol', 'kaempferol derivative', 'Kaempferols', 'p-coumaric acid', 'phytochemical', 'Phytochemicals', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'pollinator', 'synergism', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114690801&doi=10.1093%2fjisesa%2fieab053&partnerID=40&md5=13964c9033de5e523ac2d2d3aec523c0,Scopus,,0,,0,232

Recent research provided evidence that interactions between ecological stressors are drivers of declining pollinator health and responsible for observed population collapses. We used the honeybee Apis mellifera and conducted a series of experiments to test for long-term effects of a single short exposure to the agricultural pesticide flupyradifurone to a second environmental stressor later in life. To do this, we exposed individuals during their larval development or early adulthood to sublethal dosages of flupyradifurone (0.025 mu g for larvae and 0.645 mu g for imagos), either pure or as part of an agricultural formulation (Sivanto). We afterwards exposed bees to a second ecological stressor infecting individuals with 10,000 spores of the fungal gut parasite Nosema ceranae. We found that pesticide exposures significantly reduced survival of bees and altered the expression of several immune and detoxification genes. The ability of bees to respond to these latter effects differed significantly between colonies, offering opportunities to breed bees with elevated levels of pesticide tolerance in the future. We conclude that short episodes of sublethal pesticide exposures during development are sufficient to trigger effects later in life and could therefore contribute to the widespread declines in bee health.",2019/12/24/,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-56224-1,9.0,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000508915600002,,,,,,,0,,0,233

Multiple studies have shown that these factors can interact, producing a synergistic effect that can compromise the viability of honey bees. This study analyses the interactions between different pesticides and the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and their effect on immune and detoxification gene expression, sugar consumption and mortality in the Iberian western honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). For this purpose, workers were infected with N. ceranae and subjected to a sugar-water diet with field concentrations of the pesticides sulfoxaflor, azoxystrobin and glyphosate. Increased sugar intake and altered immune and cytochrome P450 gene expression were observed in workers exposed to sulfoxaflor and infected with N. ceranae. None of the pesticides affected Nosema spore production in honey bee gut. Of the three pesticides tested (alone or in combination) only sulfoxaflor increased mortality in honey bees. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of sulfoxaflor were attenuated in contact with other pesticides, and that Nosema infection leads to increase sugar intake in sulfoxaflor-exposed bees.

Understanding how these factors affect crop pollinator communities is crucial to inform practices that generate optimal pollination and ensure sustainable food production. In this study, we investigated the effects of landscape composition and pesticide residues on bee communities and their pollination services in Solanum quitoense Lam. ""lulo"" crops in Colombia. On 10 farms, located along a gradient of land use change that varied from 0.15 to 0.62 in their natural habitat proportion, we characterized the bee community visiting the crop, and carried out pollination experiments with bagged and open inflorescences to later estimate fruit set, weight, and diameter at every site. Additionally, we performed pesticide analysis on collected anthers through liquid chromatography to estimate pesticide risk coming from the crop fields using hazard quotients (HQ). Bee abundance and species richness decreased with increased HQ, but these negative pesticide effects were less detrimental in farms with higher natural habitat proportions. However, this buffer effect was lost at sites with very high HQs. Imidacloprid was frequently found in the anthers and there were extremely high concentrations in some farms (0.6 to 13,063 mu g/kg), representing the molecule of greatest risk for bees in this context. Pollinator's importance to crop yield was demonstrated in the exclusion experiments, where we found a reduction in fruit set (51%), weight (39%), and diameter (25%). We found a significant effect of bee richness on fruit set, while landscape composition and HQ had no significant effect on fruit set, suggesting that the last two factors do not affect yield directly, but indirectly through a decrease in pollinator diversity. Our results provide novel evidence that natural habitat loss due to the expansion of pastures for cattle ranching and pesticide residues in anthers reduce bee diversity and abundance in this Andean cropping system, but strategies to protect and restore natural habitat can help to buffer, until certain levels, these negative effects.",2021/08//undefined,2021,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01668,28.0,,,,2351-9894,WOS:000683779400008,"['Bee pollination', 'Ecosystem services', 'Imidacloprid', 'Landscape simplification', 'Lulo', 'Naranjilla', 'Solanum quitoense']",,,,,,0,pollination,0,236

Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose‚Äìresponse relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104.0,,33,39,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034786241&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2017.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=2ec6d258462a734f7451789afb4ab060,Scopus,,0,,0,238

Honey bees are suffering from elevated colony losses in the northern hemisphere possibly because of a variety of emergent microbial pathogens, with which pesticides may interact to exacerbate their impacts. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered at sublethal and field realistic doses one neonicotinoid pesticide (thiacloprid) and two common microbial pathogens, the invasive microsporidian Nosema ceranae and black queen cell virus (BQCV), individually to larval and adult honey bees in the laboratory. Through fully crossed experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination, we found an additive interaction between BQCV and thiacloprid on host larval survival likely because the pesticide significantly elevated viral loads. In adult bees, two synergistic interactions increased individual mortality: between N.ceranae and BQCV, and between N.ceranae and thiacloprid. The combination of two pathogens had a more profound effect on elevating adult mortality than N.ceranae plus thiacloprid.

We focus on imidacloprid that is a neonicotinoid insecticide commonly used in Brazil.

However, the visitation rate recovery for P. lineata was only detected in the less than the more intensive treatment after imidacloprid applications ceased. The fact that no differences in fruit production were detected between treatments (including control blocks) could result from a null net effect of the negative effects on pollinators and positive effects on pest control.

Pesticides have been proposed as a potential cause of this decline. Bees are exposed simultaneously to a variety of agrochemicals, which may cause synergistically detrimental impacts, which are incompletely understood. We investigated the toxicity of the fungicide imazalil in mixture with four common insecticides: fipronil (phenylpyrazoid), cypermethrin (pyrethroid), thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides like imazalil can inhibit P450 detoxification systems in insects and therefore fungicide ‚àí insecticide co-occurrence might produce synergistic toxicity in bees. We assessed the impact of dietary fungicide ‚àí insecticide mixtures on the mortality and feeding rates of laboratory bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.). RESULTS: Regarding mortality, imazalil synergised the toxicity of fipronil, cypermethrin and thiamethoxam, but not imidacloprid. We found no synergistic effects on feeding rates. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that P450-based detoxification processes are differentially important in mitigating the toxicity of certain insecticides, even those of the same chemical class. Our evidence that cocktail effects can arise in bumble bees should extend concern about the potential impacts of agrochemical mixtures to include wild bee species in farmland. ¬© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2018///,2018,10.1002/ps.4756,74.0,3,541,546,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037367733&doi=10.1002%2fps.4756&partnerID=40&md5=d7f182ffc9e1061420199ac837709b25,Scopus,,0,,0,243

Because insecticides are used during bloom to manage insect pests, bumble bees may be at risk of exposure. We therefore assessed the susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life span, and reproduction. The highest concentration of deltamethrin (17 mg a.i./L) reduced feeding. Workers treated with deltamethrin had shortened life spans and produced fewer males. Flubendiamide (2000 mg a.i./L) and spinetoram (0.8 mg a.i./L) caused no sublethal effects.

Pesticides have been proposed as one of the main cause of pollinators decline. Several studies show that variety of pesticides co-exist in environment and also in bee products at the same time and might therefore synergise. Fipronil, cypermethrin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid are agriculturally well known and used insecticides as well as fungicide imazalil. EBI fungicides like imazalil are functioning as detoxification inhibitor tools in insects. Thereby, the fungicide and insecticide co-occurrence might lead to synergy in bees. The cocktail-effects between insecticides and fungicides are still little studied. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of previously mentioned pesticides and their mixtures impact on bumble bee longevity and feeding rate. The bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) were fed with syrup containing different single pesticides and their combinations. Bees mortality and feeding rate was daily monitored. Here we show that 3 of these insecticides are synergising with fungicide and due that causing significant decrease in bumble bees longevity and feeding rate. The results from this experiment allows us to suppose that EBI fungicide imazalil inhibits the detoxification processes in bees and due that toxicity of insecticides increases. Although fungicides are considered as quite safe to bees when used appropriately and alone but in combination with insecticides might lead to faster individual death. Several studies have demonstrated impacts of single pesticides on bees, but yet there is a lack of data of synergistic effects.

This has led to bans on neonicotinoid use in the EU and has resulted in repeated calls for the agrochemical regulatory process to be modified. For example, there is increasing concern about 1) the underrepresentation of wild bees, such as bumblebees, in the regulatory process, and 2) the failure to determine how agrochemicals, such as neonicotinoids, interact with other commonly occurring environmental stressors, such as parasites. Here, we modify an OECD approved lethal dose (LD50) experimental design and coexpose bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and the highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, in a fully crossed design. We found no difference in the LD50 of thiamethoxam on bumblebees that had or had not been inoculated with the parasite (Crithidia bombi). Furthermore, thiamethoxam dosage did not appear to influence the parasite intensity of surviving bumblebees, and there was no effect of either parasite or insecticide on sucrose consumption. The methodology used demonstrates how existing ring-tested experimental designs can be effectively modified to include other environmental stressors such as parasites.

Various stressors, such as the conversion of natural habitats, climate change, land-use intensification, agrochemicals and pathogens, are thought to be major factors in this decline. We treated female bees of two common pollinator species in Europe, Osmia bicornis and Bombus terrestris, with a field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. We tested its effects on the foraging behavior of O. bicornis under semi-natural conditions and on the antennal sensitivity of both bee species to common floral volatiles by using electroantennography. Clothianidin negatively affected the foraging behavior in O. bicornis by decreasing the number of flowers visited per foraging flight and by increasing the time per flower visit and the searching time between two flowers. It also decreased the antennal sensitivity to 2-phenylethanol in the two bee species. Thus, clothianidin is clearly a threat for bees via its effects on their foraging behavior and antennal sensitivity and is hence probably detrimental for pollination and the reproductive success of bees. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2021 Straub, Orih, Kimmich and Ayasse.",2021///,2021,10.3389/fevo.2021.697355,9.0,,,,,,"['antennal sensitivity', 'Bombus terrestris', 'clothianidin', 'foraging flight', 'neonicotinoid', 'Osmia bicornis']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115184721&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2021.697355&partnerID=40&md5=8dececbc79aa7c4a192a7d97b4fd76fc,Scopus,,0,,0,247

Learning, which has been a focus of previous ecotoxicological studies in bees, may play a key role in driving colony fitness. Here we move beyond the standard single-stressor approach to ask how multiple stressors, an agrochemical (sulfoxaflor, a relatively new insecticide) and a parasite (Crithidia bombi, a prevalent gut parasite of bumblebees), impact learning in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We developed a modified version of the classic proboscis extension reflex assay to assess the combined effects of acute oral sulfoxaflor exposure and infection by C. bombi on olfactory learning of bumblebee workers. We found no evidence that either sulfoxaflor, C. bombi, or their combination had any significant effect on bumblebee olfactory learning, despite their known negative impacts on other aspects of bumblebee health.

The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two insecticides on the development of the HPGs and on the survival of Apis mellifera intermissa a native African subspecies of honey bee present in Algeria. Newly emerged workers were acutely and chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and spinosad through sugar syrup and pollen pastry. The effects of these insecticides were assessed by measuring the size of HPGs acini and the total head protein content. The survival of the workers was also evaluated over 60 days when they were chronically exposed to the insecticides at concentrations corresponding to LC25 and LC10. We found that the insecticide-treated workers, after both acute and chronic exposure, exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped HPG acini. The total head protein content also decreased in treated individuals with the two concentrations of insecticides at day 6 and 9 compared to the respective controls. While the control group exhibited an LC25 (i.e. the time needed to kill 50% of the tested workers) of 22 days, the LC25 was only 3 days for the workers exposed to the LC25 of spinosad and all workers were dead at day 17. In contrast, thiamethoxam exposure at LC25 had no significant detrimental effect on honey bee survival.

Nevertheless, there have been increasing concerns regarding their impact on non-target organisms. Glyphosate is also widely used in crops and, therefore, traces of this pesticide are likely to be found together with neonicotinoids. Although glyphosate is considered a herbicide, adverse effects have been found on animal species, including honey bees. Apis mellifera is one of the most important pollinators in agroecosystems and is exposed to both these pesticides. Traces can be found in nectar and pollen of flowers that honey bees visit, but also in honey stores inside the hive. Young workers, which perform in-hive tasks that are crucial for colony maintenance, are potentially exposed to both these contaminated resources. These workers present high plasticity and are susceptible to stimuli that can modulate their behaviour and impact on colony state. Therefore, by performing standardised assays to study sublethal effects of these pesticides, these bees can be used as bioindicators. We studied the effect of chronic joint exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and glyphosate on gustatory perception and olfactory learning. Both pesticides reduced sucrose responsiveness and had a negative effect on olfactory learning. Glyphosate also reduced food uptake during rearing. The results indicate differential susceptibility according to honey bee age. The two agrochemicals had adverse effects on different aspects of honey bee appetitive behaviour, which could have repercussions for food distribution, propagation of olfactory information and task coordination within the nest. ¬© 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.",2018///,2018,10.1242/jeb.176644,221.0,7,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045350300&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.176644&partnerID=40&md5=e57097603f1fcd42ba06cc7571845ede,Scopus,,0,,0,250

Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L.

For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees.

The potential lethal effects together with the ecologically relevant sublethal effects on aspects of bumblebee reproduction and foraging behaviour were evaluated. Bumblebee workers were exposed via direct contact with wet and dry residues under laboratory conditions to spinetoram at different concentrations, starting from the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) and then different dilutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10 000 of the MFRC), and compared with spinosad. In addition, the side effects via oral exposure in supplemented sugar water were assessed. RESULTS: Direct contact of B. terrestris workers with wet residues of spinosad and spinetoram showed spinetoram to be approximately 52 times less toxic than spinosad, while exposure to dry residues of spinetoram was about 8 times less toxic than exposure to those of spinosad. Oral treatment for 72 h (acute) indicated that spinetoram is about 4 times less toxic to B. terrestris workers compared with spinosad, while exposure for a longer period (i.e. 11 weeks) showed spinetoram to be 24 times less toxic. In addition, oral exposure to the two spinosyns resulted in detrimental sublethal effects on bumblebee reproduction. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for spinosad was 1/1000 of the MFRC, and 1/100 of the MFRC for spinetoram. Comparison between the chronic exposure bioassays assessing the sublethal effects on nest reproduction, with and without allowing for foraging behaviour, showed that the respective NOEC values for spinosad and spinetoram were similar over the two bioassays, indicating that there were no adverse effects by either spinosyn on the foraging of B. terrestris workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results indicate that the use of spinetoram is safer for bumblebees by direct contact and oral exposure than the use of spinosad, and therefore it can be applied safely in combination with B. terrestris. Another important conclusion is that the present data provide strong evidence that neither spinosyn has a negative effect on the foraging behaviour of these beneficial insects. However, before drawing final conclusions, spinetoram and spinosad should also be evaluated in more realistic field-related situations for the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour with the use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris. ¬© 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",2011///,2011,10.1002/ps.2093,67.0,5,541,547,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953744717&doi=10.1002%2fps.2093&partnerID=40&md5=9024a2303a41820a3bc0de393e80fa47,Scopus,,0,,0,253

Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,"['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription‚Äìquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

For instance, rapid and accurate analytical procedures are currently required to better assess the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honeybee health. Since their introduction in agriculture, neonicotinoid insecticides have been blamed for being highly toxic to honeybees, possibly at the nanogram per bee level or lower. As a consequence, most of the analytical methods recently optimized have focused on the analysis of ultratraces of neonicotinoids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to study the effects of sublethal doses. However, recent evidences on two novel routes-seedling guttations and seed coating particulate, both associated with corn crops-that may expose honeybees to huge amounts of neonicotinoids in the field, with instantly lethal effects, suggest that selected procedures need optimizing. In the present work, a simplified ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection method for the determination of neonicotinoids in single bees has been optimized and validated. The method ensures good selectivity, good accuracy, and adequate detection limits, which make it suitable for the purpose, while maintaining its ability to evaluate exposure variability of individual bees. It has been successfully applied to the analysis of bees in free flight over an experimental sowing field, with the bees therefore being exposed to seed coating particulate released by the pneumatic drilling machine.",2013/01//undefined,2013,10.1007/s00216-012-6338-3,405.0,02-Mar,1007,1014,1618-2642,WOS:000313650800048,,,,,,,0,residues,0,255

However, little is known about the extent of environmental neonicotinoids contamination in China. In this study, a total of 693 honey samples from across China, from both Apis melifera and Apis cerana, were analyzed to examine neonicotinoid concentrations and their geographical distribution, and correlation with the primary plant species from which the honey was obtained. Furthermore, chronic and acute exposure risk and risk ranking for humans eating honey were investigated, and risks to bees were also considered. The results revealed that 40.8% of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoids tested. Honeys from commercial crops were found to be more frequently contaminated with neonicotinoids than those from noncommercial crops. Honey samples from Apis mellifera were more frequently contaminated than those from Apis cerana.

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential correlation, in the reported incidents, between exposure to pesticide treatments and virus infections. Here we summarize the situation in northeastern Italy during spring 2014, evaluated by monitoring 150 active ingredients and three honey bee viruses in dead honey bees and other matrices. At least one active ingredient was found in 72.2% of the 79 dead honey bee samples, with the most abundant (59.4%) being insecticides, mainly belonging to the class of neonicotinoids (41.8%), followed by fungicides (40.6%). Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, tau-fluvalinate, and cyprodinil were the most frequently detected active ingredients. Multiple virus infections were monitored, revealing a high prevalence of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) and deformed wing virus (DWV), detected in all samples except one. 71 and 37% of the CBPV- and DWV positive samples, respectively, showed a high number of viral copies per bee (>107).

Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25¬†¬µg CTD/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse effect-dose (NOAED) of 7.3¬†ng/bee/d for all responses measured. Based on a NOAEC of 19.7¬†¬µg/kg pollen, the NOAED for honeybee larvae was 2.4¬†ng/bee larva/d. For exposures via dust, a no-observed-adverse effect rate of 4¬†g CTD/ha was used to assess relevance of exposures via deposition of dust. The overall weight of evidence suggested that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to CTD from its use as a seed treatment. For exposures via dust, dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, there were no exposures greater than the NOAED for CTD in nectar and pollen, indicating a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure was via uptake in plants. Analysis of effect studies in the field indicated a consistent lack of relevant effects, regardless of the way CTD was applied. For exposures via dust, there were no adverse effects because of these applications and there were no exposures greater than the NOAED for CTD in nectar and pollen. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicated no adverse effects on colony viability or survival of the colony.

Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS: Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L‚àí1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L‚àí1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L‚àí1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L‚àí1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control. A significant decrease in survival, relative to the solvent control, occurred in the 0.8, 1.2 and 8 mg L‚àí1 chlorpyrifos, 0.4, 2 and 10 mg L‚àí1 clothianidin, and 45 mg L‚àí1 dimethoate diets, but not the imidacloprid diets. CONCLUSION: The treatment of larval diets with clothianidin, dimethoate and imidacloprid did not affect survival, developmental rate, or weight of immature honey bees; however, treatment with chlorpyrifos did.

As such it is intrinsically toxic to insects and among them to the honey bee (Apis mellifera). An updated risk assessment is presented in the context of the regulatory evaluation of spinosad products and is in accordance with the latest recommendation of regulatory guidance documents. Results: The intrinsic toxicity to the honey bee as observed in laboratory conditions through oral and contact tests on adults does not appear to impair honey bee colonies when exposed to treated attractive crops in tunnel conditions. Reasons for this could include reduced availability of residues of the product on plant surface compared to laboratory conditions, together with a fast dissipation from treated plants and the absence of active degradation products. Conclusions: Spinosad products present a negligible impact on honey bees when used under the current label recommendations and conditions of agricultural use. This conclusion deduced from data available for the regulatory risk assessment has been confirmed by the feedback of surveys on incidents, which address the potential impact of spinosad products under realistic conditions of exposure, including other environmental and chemical factors that are common in cropped areas.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.032,437.0,,107,114,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200026,,,"['Oomen, PA', 'Thompson, H']",,,,0,review,0,260

Various pesticides have threatened the abundance and diversity of bumblebees. In addition to direct sublethal effects, pesticides may alter the gut microbial communities of bees. Imidacloprid and flupyradifurone insecticides both bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, the latter was assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied to flowering crops. In this study, we assessed the impacts of these two pesticides on queenless microcolonies and the gut microbiota of Bombus terrestris. We found that 10 mu g/L imidacloprid significantly impeded syrup consumption, and post-poned the egg-laying period, larvae, and pupae development. It decreased the relative abundance of the bumblebee-specific symbionts, Apibacter and Lactobacillus Firm-5. On the contrary, 10 mu g/L flupyradifurone did not reduce syrup consumption, block larvae and pupae development in bumble-bees.

Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment of the level of neonicotinoid contamination and the associated health risks to non-targeted organisms in commercial honey and pollen produced in China. This study collected 160 batches of honey and 26 batches of pollen from different regions and plant sources in China, analyzed the residue patterns of neonicotinoid pesticides, and comprehensively evaluated the exposure risks to non-targeted organisms including bees (adults and larvae) and humans. Furthermore, this study addresses this imperative by establishing a high-throughput, rapid, and ultra-sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) based on broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies to detect and quantify neonicotinoids, with validation conducted using the LC-MS/MS method. The findings indicated that 59.4 % of honey samples contained at least one of eight neonicotinoids, and the ic-ELISA rapid detection and calculation method could detect all the samples containing neonicotinoids. Additionally, the dietary risk assessment for humans and honeybees indicates that the consumption of a specific quantity of honey may not pose a health risk to human due to neonicotinoid intake.

Since most of the native species do not present economic importance, they may suffer ‚Äúsilent extinction‚Äù, due to lack of monitoring of their colonies. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the lethal and sublethal concentrations of the insecticide thiamethoxam, with evaluation of its sublethal effects on mobility, in the stingless bee Plebeia catamarcensis (Holmberg, 1903). Foraging bees were collected and exposed to thiamethoxam to determine lethal (LC50) and sublethal concentrations. The 24 h LC50 was 0.408 ng a.i./ŒºL, a value demonstrating that this species may be as sensitive as other stingless bees already studied. Sublethal concentrations influenced the locomotion abilities of the bees, making them hyperactive when exposed to LC50/10 and lethargic when exposed to LC50/100. The effects of sublethal concentrations on individuals may have collective consequences, especially in colonies with few individuals, as is the case of P. catamarcensis.

Royal jelly containing 1 ppb imidacloprid was provided to larvae for 3 consecutive days (2‚Äì4 days postemergence). Queen larvae treated with imidacloprid showed lower capping and emergence rates (35.5% and 24.22%, respectively) than did control larvae (61.68% and 52.95%, respectively), indicating a high failure rate of queen rearing associated with imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage.

They have observed that these mass bee deaths tend to occur at about the same time as measures are taken to control rice bugs, which appear every year during the summer in rice-producing districts. We set up and conducted controlled field studies from July to August in 2012 in a rice-producing district of northern Japan where frequent mass bee deaths are observed each summer. As had occurred in the area in previous years, and as we directly observed during our field investigations, masses of honey bees were found dead at the entrance to their hives. Samples of pollen and honey bee corpses were found to contain measurable concentrations of five active ingredients of insecticides: clothianidin, dinotefuran, ethiprole, etofenprox, and phenthoate. Insecticides containing these active ingredients are known to have been used for rice bug control in this area. Furthermore, we did not observe other known honey bee death agents in the area, such as mites and hornets. Thus, we suspected that the phenomenon of ""piled honey bee death"" (PD) at hive entrances is related to the influence of insecticides used to control rice bugs in paddies. The insecticide concentrations in dead honey bees were, however, extremely low compared with the median lethal dose (LD50) for honey bees. Moreover, PD was observed after rice anthesis, when bees would be collecting pollen from flowering plants other than rice. This calls into question any direct link between mass bee death and insecticides. Further study is necessary to understand insecticide exposure routes and the actual mechanism of the PD phenomenon. ¬© IBRA 2014",2014///,2014,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.12,53.0,5,,,599,606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920153258&doi=10.3896%2fIBRA.1.53.5.12&partnerID=40&md5=ba4eacfa3b5fbbadcfd183d8440f1dd9,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,266

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees.

However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.",2019/03/18/,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-39701-5,9.0,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000461418200001,,,,,,,0,,0,268

Fungicides are authorized for use during crop blooms because of their low acute toxicity to honey bees. Thus, a bee that might have been previously exposed to pesticides through contaminated food may be subjected to fungicide spraying when it initiates its first flight outside the hive. In this study, we assessed the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide in bees with different toxicological statuses. Three days after emergence, bees were subjected to chronic exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid and the herbicide glyphosate, either individually or in a binary mixture, at environmental concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 Œºg/L in food (0.0083 and 0.083 Œºg/kg) for 30 days. Seven days after the beginning of chronic exposure to the pesticides (10 days after emergence), the bees were subjected to spraying with the fungicide difenoconazole at the registered field dosage. The results showed a delayed significant decrease in survival when honey bees were treated with the fungicide. Fungicide toxicity increased when honey bees were chronically exposed to glyphosate at the lowest concentration, decreased when they were exposed to imidacloprid, and did not significantly change when they were exposed to the binary mixture regardless of the concentration. Bees exposed to all of these pesticide combinations showed physiological disruptions, revealed by the modulation of several life history traits related mainly to metabolism, even when no effect of the other pesticides on fungicide toxicity was observed. These results show that the toxicity of active substances may be misestimated in the pesticide registration procedure, especially for fungicides. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021///,2021,10.1007/s11356-021-13747-3,28.0,31,42807,42820,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Difenoconazole fungicide', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Glyphosate herbicide', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'Honey bee survival', 'Imidacloprid insecticide', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Toxicological status']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103642676&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-13747-3&partnerID=40&md5=366d1ad35a16b07eb2a6b9cb1c48843c,Scopus,,0,,0,269

One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018///,2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1883-3,27.0,2,175,187,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038868257&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-017-1883-3&partnerID=40&md5=bd9b6a48434b0c0aee93fbb0f6728b07,Scopus,,0,,0,270

However, exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids represents a major problem for bee health, necessitating strategies that can improve agricultural sustainability and pollinator health. Here we report a simple and scalable solution, through ingestible hydrogel microparticles (IHMs), which can capture neonicotinoids in vitro and in the bee gastrointestinal tract to mitigate the harmful effects of pesticides. Using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) as a model species and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, we demonstrated by means of lethal and sublethal assays the substantial benefits of IHM treatments. Under lethal exposure of imidacloprid, bumblebees that received IHM treatment exhibited a 30% increase in survival relative to groups without IHM treatment. After a sublethal exposure of 5 ng, IHM treatment resulted in improved feeding motivation and a 44% increase in the number of bees that engaged in locomotor activity. Wingbeat frequency was significantly lower after a single 5 or 10 ng imidacloprid dose; however, IHM treatment improved wingbeat frequency. Overall, the IHMs improved bumblebee health, and with further optimization have the potential to benefit apiculture and reduce risk during crop pollination by managed bees. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1038/s41893-024-01432-5,,,,,,,"['Agricultural economy', 'Agricultural sustainability', 'Crop cultivation', 'Imidacloprids', 'In-vitro', 'Insecticides', 'Micro particles', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticides exposures', 'Scalable solution', 'Simple++']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203274290&doi=10.1038%2fs41893-024-01432-5&partnerID=40&md5=7e7aef2280c9237440440fa49f42f7e4,Scopus,,0,,0,274

Here, the authors combine a systems biology approach and laboratory experiments to show that the immune suppressive effect of the pathogen deformed wing virus can be responsible for the disparity amongst honey bee experiments. While there is widespread concern regarding the impact of pesticides on honey bees, well-replicated field experiments, to date, have failed to provide clear insights on pesticide effects. Here, we adopt a systems biology approach to gain insights into the web of interactions amongst the factors influencing honey bee health. We put the focus on the properties of the system that depend upon its architecture and not on the strength, often unknown, of each single interaction. Then we test in vivo, on caged honey bees, the predictions derived from this modelling analysis. We show that the impact of toxic compounds on honey bee health can be shaped by the concurrent stressors affecting bees. We demonstrate that the immune-suppressive capacity of the widespread pathogen of bees, deformed wing virus, can introduce a critical positive feed-back loop in the system causing bistability, i.e., two stable equilibria. Therefore, honey bees under similar initial conditions can experience different consequences when exposed to the same stressor, including prolonged survival or premature death. The latter can generate an increased vulnerability of the hive to dwindling and collapse.

Monarchs rely on milkweed over multiple life stages, including as a host plant for eggs and a food source for both larvae (leaves) and adults (flowers). Milkweeds, which are closely associated with field margins, can contain neonicotinoid residues, but previous assessments are constrained to a single plant tissue type. In 2017 and 2018, we sampled milkweeds from 95 field margins adjacent to crop fields (corn, soybean, hay, wheat, and barley) in agricultural landscapes of eastern Ontario, Canada. Milkweeds were sampled during the flower blooming period and leaves and flower tissues were analysed. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid were detected. Maximum concentrations in leaf samples included 10.30 ng/g of clothianidin in 2017, and 24.4 ng/g of thiamethoxam in 2018. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam percent detections in flowers (72 % and 61 %, respectively) were significantly higher than detections in leaves (24 % and 31 %, respectively). Thiamethoxam concentrations were significantly higher in paired flower samples than leaf samples (median 0.33 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g) while clothianidin concentrations also trended higher in flowers (median 0.18‚Äì0.55 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g). Only thiamethoxam showed significant differences between years, and we found no effect of crop type, with hay, soybean and corn fields all yielding 50‚Äì56 % detections in leaves. We found significantly higher concentrations in older milkweed flowers than young flowers or leaves (medians 0.87 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g and 0.45 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g for clothianidin and thiamethoxam, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of considering variation in milkweed tissue type and age of flowers in neonicotinoid exposure risk assessments.

These results demonstrate the importance of studying the effects of chemical cocktails based on low realistic exposure levels and developing long-term tests to reveal possible lethal and adverse sublethal interactions in honey bees and other insect pollinators. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111013,203.0,,,,,,"['1,3 dioxolane derivative', 'abdomen', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'alkaline phosphatase', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Cocktail effects', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration response', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'difenoconazole', 'Dioxolanes', 'drug effect', 'drug potentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'enzyme regulation', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase', 'glutathione transferase', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'head', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'immunity', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'lethal dose', 'long term exposure', 'metabolism', 'midgut', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nervous system', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'oxidative stress', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'Pesticides', 'physiological response', 'Physiological state', 'physiological stress', 'physiology', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'risk assessment', 'sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'Synergy', 'toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'triazole derivative', 'Triazoles', 'winter', 'Winter honey bee', 'xenobiotic metabolism']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088153278&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111013&partnerID=40&md5=d818b334f27dcec4187873bfa4d085d3,Scopus,,0,,0,280
313,886,JOUR,Sperm viability and gene expression in honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) following exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos,"['Chaimanee, V.', 'Evans, J.D.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Jackson, C.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.03.004,89.0,,1,8,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960857417&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2016.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=33b4203b1a0bd361e5b24a1bfbf0fc22,Scopus,,0,,0,281

Methods used to study learning processes and foraging behaviour were adapted to test the sublethal effects of the insecticide molecule imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl) at both individual and colony levels under confined conditions. At the individual level, we studied the effects of long term ingestion of 4-40 ppb imidacloprid (11 days administration) on olfactory learning performances using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension on restrained bees. At the colony level, a sugar solution containing 50 ppb of imidacloprid was fed to a colony in a flight cage (14 days administration) to determine the effects (1) on the flight activity as measured with an activity counter set at the hive entrance and (2) on the olfactory discrimination performances on an artificial flower feeder. The olfactory conditioning showed that honey bees surviving the diet contaminated with imidacloprid had reduced olfactory learning performances. Only the concentration of 4 ppb induced a percentage of mortality not significantly different from the control diet after long term ingestion. In the flight cage, the administration of imidacloprid led to a decrease in the flight activity and the olfactory discrimination performances. Thus, the decrease in the learning performances induced by imidacloprid at the individual level was confirmed at the colony level.

Recently, populations of honey bees have been declining due to a combination of factors, including the widespread use of agricultural pesticides. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute oral toxicity of different formulated pesticides to honey bee adults. In particular, we assessed the acute oral toxicity of two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, Assail 30SG and thiamethoxam, Actara 25WDG) and two other systemic insecticide products (sulfoxaflor, Closer 2SC and flupyradifurone, Sivanto 200SL), all of which are generally used in pest management programs in commercial apple orchards in the Eastern United States. Honey bees were fed a range of doses of each pesticide in order to create a response curve, and LC50, LC90, and LD50 values were determined. The pesticide formulation containing flupyradifurone as the active ingredient was found to be the least toxic to honey bees followed by the formulations containing sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid.

The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain. Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of ""Sivanto"" against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects. Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors studied here. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).",2018///,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-23200-0,8.0,1,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044320599&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-23200-0&partnerID=40&md5=78ee33baade1711826230f3c51e59252,Scopus,,0,,0,284

The main objective of the present study was to evaluate comparatively the health of Carniolan and Africanized honey bees (AHB) co-exposed to thiamethoxam and Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae) spores. Newly-emerged worker honey bees were exposed solely with different sublethal doses of thiamethoxam (2% and 0.2% of LD50 for AHB), which could be consumed by bees under field conditions. Toxicity tests for the Carniolan bees were performed, and the LD50 of thiamethoxam for Carniolan honey bees was 7.86 ng bee-1. Immunohistological analyses were also performed to detect cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and/or N. ceranae treated bees. Thiamethoxam exposure had no negative impact on Nosema development in experimental conditions, but it clearly inhibited cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and Nosema-exposed bees, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical data. Indeed, thiamethoxam exposure only had a minor synergistic toxic effect on midgut tissue when applied as a low dose simultaneously with N. ceranae to AHB and Carniolan honey bees, in comparison with the effect caused by both stressors separately. Our data provides insights into the effects of the neonicotenoid thiamethoxam on the AHB and Carniolan honey bee life span, as well as the effects of simultaneous application of thiamethoxam and N. ceranae spores to honey bees. ¬© 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.12.030,147.0,,328,336,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957799809&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2015.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=6d713555218035c2b5a1ca0720e7ee43,Scopus,,0,,0,285

Many studies showed that neonicotinoid pesticides harm honeybee learning and farming activities, negatively affect colony adaptation and reduce pollination abilities. Bumblebees are heavily preferred species all over the world in order to ensure pollination in plant production. In this study, sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the brain of Bombus terrestris workers were analyzed. Suspensions (1/1000, 1/100, 1/10) of the maximum recommended dose of thiamethoxam were applied to the workers. 48 h after spraying, morphological effects on the brains of workers were studied. According to area measurements of ICC's of Kenyon cells, there was a significant difference between 1/10 dose and all groups. On the other hand, areas of INC's of Kenyon cells showed a significant difference between the control group and all dose groups. Neuropil disorganization in the calyces increased gradually and differed significantly between the groups and was mostly detected at the highest dose (1/10). Apart from optic lobes, pycnotic nuclei were also observed in the middle region of calyces of mushroom bodies in the high dose group. Also, the width of the lamina, medulla and lobula parts of the optic lobes of each group and the areas of the antennal lobes were measured and significant differences were determined between the groups.

We quantified concentrations of two types of systemic insecticides, neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and butenolides (flupyradifurone), in off-crop nontarget media of hummingbird cloacal fluid, honey bee (Apis mellifera) nectar and honey, and wildflowers before and after regulation of imidacloprid on highbush blueberries in Canada in April 2021. We found that mean total pesticide load increased in hummingbird cloacal fluid, nectar, and flower samples following imidacloprid regulation. On average, we did not find evidence of a decrease in imidacloprid concentrations after regulation. However, there were some decreases, some increases, and other cases with no changes in imidacloprid levels depending on the specific media, time point of sampling, and site type. At the same time, we found an overall increase in flupyradifurone, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid but no change in clothianidin concentrations. In particular, flupyradifurone concentrations observed in biota sampled near agricultural areas increased twofold in honey bee nectar, sevenfold in hummingbird cloacal fluid, and eightfold in flowers after the 2021 imidacloprid regulation. The highest residue detected was flupyradifurone at 665 ng/mL (parts per billion [ppb]) in honey bee nectar. Mean total pesticide loads were highest in honey samples (84 ¬± 10 ppb), followed by nectar (56 ¬± 7 ppb), then hummingbird cloacal fluid (1.8 ¬± 0.5 ppb), and least, flowers (0.51 ¬± 0.06 ppb).

Here, we investigated effects of acetamiprid, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae, which act either alone or in combination. Our results suggested that interaction between the three factors was additive, with survival risk increasing as the number of stressors increased. Although exposure to 150 Œºg/L acetamiprid alone did not negatively impact honey bee survival, it caused severe damage to midgut tissue. Among the three stressors, V. destructor posed the greatest threat to honey bee survival, and N. ceranae exacerbated intestinal damage and increased thickness of the midgut wall. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that different combinations of stressors elicited specific gene expression responses in honey bees, and genes involved in energy metabolism, immunity, and detoxification were altered in response to multiple stressor combinations. Additionally, genes associated with Toll and Imd signalling, tyrosine metabolism, and phototransduction pathway were significantly suppressed in response to different combinations of multiple stressors. This study enhances our understanding of the adaptation mechanisms to multiple stressors and aids in development of suitable protective measures for honey bees. Environmental Implication: We believe our study is environmentally relevant for the following reasons: This study investigates combined effects of pesticide, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae.

85,160,JOUR,A new method to assess the acute toxicity toward honeybees of the abrasion particles generated from seeds coated with insecticides,"['Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Girolami, V', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background Large amounts of insecticide-containing dusts produced from abrasion of the seed dressing can be released into the atmosphere during sowing operations. Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1990s for several crops, are the leading products for seed-coating treatments in many countries. Neonicotinoid containing dusts can be effectively intercepted by bees in flight over the sowing field, inducing lethal acute effects, so that restrictions in the use of the main neonicotinoids have been adopted in the European Union. This led to the consequent introduction of replacement insecticides for seed-coating, i.e. methiocarb and thiacloprid, despite the lack of information on both the toxicity and the exposure scenarios for honeybees. Results In this study, a laboratory apparatus was developed in order to quantify the toxicity of the dusts produced from the abrasion of the seed coating. This quantification is based on (i) an airstream transporting coating particles into an exposure chamber; (ii) exposure of bees to reproducible and measurable concentrations of insecticide, and (iii) direct measurement of the exposure dose on single bees. The method allowed us to perform in vivo experiments of honeybee exposure to provide toxicity data in more realistic exposure conditions. In fact, the formulation rather than the active principle alone can be tested, and the exposure is through dusts rather than a solution so that specific absorption behavior can be studied in representative environmental conditions. The method was used to quantify the acute toxicity (LD50) of dusts obtained from the abrasion of corn seeds coated with clothianidin, thiacloprid and methiocarb. Conclusions Our results show that, surprisingly, the replacement insecticide methiocarb has a toxicity (LD50 = 421-693 ng/bee) in the same order of magnitude as clothianidin (LD50 = 113-451 ng/bee) through this specific exposure route, while thiacloprid (LD50 = 16.9 center dot 10(3) ng/bee) has a significantly lower acute toxicity. Moreover, dusts containing methiocarb and clothianidin show a significant increase in toxicity when, after exposure, bees are kept under high humidity conditions. This suggests that the method here presented can be used to obtain complementary toxicity data in the risk assessment procedure for the authorization of new seed-coating insecticides or new formulations.",2020/07/06/,2020,10.1186/s12302-020-00372-z,32.0,1,,,2190-4707,WOS:000545648100001,"['abrasion', 'Abrasion dusts', 'Acute toxicity', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'clothianidin', 'coating', 'ecotoxicology', 'Exposure measurement', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'Honeybees', 'maize', 'Methiocarb', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide residue', 'Pollinator insects', 'risk assessment', 'seed', 'Seed coating', 'sowing', 'Systemic insecticides', 'thiacloprid', 'toxicity test', 'Zea mays']",,,,,,0,,0,289

However, these lack micronutrients present in nectar and honey, and thus may nutritionally stress colonies. Given the many stressors faced by honey bees in the environment, we evaluated how honey bees fed supplemental carbohydrates responded in combination with heat (45 ¬∞C), cold (4 ¬∞C), or imidacloprid (0.48 ng/ml) exposure. Bees were fed either honey, SS, HFCS, or HFCS + pollen and then exposed to abiotic stress treatments in the lab. Hive bee mortality was not affected by heat or cold stress, but mortality was greater for bees fed SS in imidacloprid treatments. Levels of stress proteins (superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein (HSP70), and potentially esterase) were quantified to determine sublethal stress. SOD levels were reduced in SS and HFCS treatments, indicating these diets impaired a response to oxidative stress, particularly at 45 ¬∞C. HSP70 levels were higher in the imidacloprid treatment, with no differences between control and temperature treatments. Diet interacted significantly with stress treatment with generally negative responses to HFCS. There was no effect of diet on esterase levels, though activity was much lower at 4 ¬∞C. In semifield trials, colonies with newly emerged bees fed SS experienced higher rates of worker mortality. In cage and field trials, bees consumed significantly more honey and HFCS + P than SS and HFCS. Together, these results suggest that supplemental carbohydrates contribute to sublethal stress, and natural food sources are preferred. ¬© 2018, ¬© 2018 International Bee Research Association.",2018///,2018,10.1080/00218839.2018.1494912,57.0,5,682,689,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054476126&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2018.1494912&partnerID=40&md5=57fbbed4a2d48d0f9932f89ca0ae03d4,Scopus,,0,,0,290

There were six concentrations of each insecticide (causing > 0% to < 100 % mortality) prepared in water, and each concentration was replicated four times. The experiment was conducted using the diet incorporation method in a plastic container. Emamectin benzoate was found the most toxic insecticide with lower LC50 values (1.02 ¬µg/mL) followed by spinetoram (1.10 ¬µg/mL), chlorantraniliprole (2.74 ¬µg/mL), imidacloprid (3.09 ¬µg/mL), flonicamid (3.94 ¬µg/mL), fipronil (6.00 ¬µg/mL) after 48 h of exposure. The results showed that insecticides are very toxic to A. florea and should be used on agriculture crops with great care and during less activity. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101712,34.0,1,,,,,"['Bee keeping', 'Beneficial insects', 'Ecotoxicity', 'Pesticides', 'Pollinators']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120633835&doi=10.1016%2fj.jksus.2021.101712&partnerID=40&md5=7dac1921cf2a4ef9f7aaaed0f28d552d,Scopus,,0,,0,291

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weakened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a synergistic interaction and in the long term a higher susceptibility of the colony to pathogens. This provides the first evidences that interaction between an infectious organism and a chemical can also threaten pollinators, interactions that are widely used to eliminate insect pests in integrative pest management.",2010/03//undefined,2010,10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.02123.x,12.0,3,774,782,1462-2912,WOS:000274942300019,,,,,,,0,,0,292

Seed treatment insecticides, including neonicotinoids and novel insecticides like sulfoxaflor, display detrimental effects on wild and managed bees, even when present at sublethal quantities. These effects include deficits in flight navigation and homing ability, and decreased survival of exposed worker bees. Neonicotinoid insecticides disrupt visual motion detection in the locust, resulting in impaired escape behaviors, but it had not previously been shown whether seed treatment insecticides disrupt wide-field motion detection in the honeybee. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to two commonly used insecticides, imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and sulfoxaflor, results in impaired optomotor behavior in the honeybee. This behavioral effect correlates with altered stress and detoxification gene expression in the brain. Exposure to sulfoxaflor led to sparse increases in neuronal apoptosis, localized primarily in the optic lobes, however there was no effect of imidacloprid. We propose that exposure to cholinergic insecticides disrupts the honeybee‚Äôs ability to accurately encode wide-field visual motion, resulting in impaired optomotor behaviors. These findings provide a novel explanation for previously described effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on navigation and link these effects to sulfoxaflor for which there is a gap in scientific knowledge.

These agrochemicals pollute the environment and can negatively impact human health, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Acetamiprid, an approved neonicotinoid pesticide in the EU, may exert sub-lethal effects on pollinators and other organisms. However, our knowledge on the scope and severity of such effects is still incomplete. Our experiments focused on the effects of the insecticide formulation Mospilan (active ingredient: 20% acetamiprid) on the peripheral olfactory detection of a synthetic floral blend and foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers. We found that the applied treatment did not affect the antennal detection of the floral blend; however, it induced alterations in their foraging behaviour. Pesticide-treated individuals started foraging later, and the probability of finding the floral blend was lower than that of the control bumblebees. However, exposed bumblebees found the scent source faster than the controls. These results suggest that acetamiprid-containing Mospilan may disrupt the activity and orientation of foraging bumblebees. We hypothesize that the observed effects of pesticide exposure on foraging behaviour could be mediated through neurophysiological and endocrine mechanisms.

The recent pollinator decline is threatening both their diversity and abundance. One of the main drivers of this decline is the extensive use of pesticides. Neonicotinoids, one of the most popular groups of pesticides, can be toxic to bees. In fact, numerous studies have found that neonicotinoids can cause sublethal effects, which can impair the biology, physiology, and colony survival of the bees. Yet, there are still knowledge gaps, and more research is needed to better understand the interaction between neonicotinoids and bees, especially in the field. A new optical sensor, which can automatically identify flying insects using machine learning, has been created to continuously monitor insect activity in the field. This study investigated the potential use of this sensor as a tool for monitoring the sublethal effects of pesticides on bumblebees. Bombus terrestris workers were orally exposed to field-realistic doses of imidacloprid. Two types of exposures were tested: acute and chronic. The flight activity of pesticide-exposed and non-exposed bumblebees was recorded, and the events of the insect flights recorded by the sensor were used in two ways: to extract the values of the wingbeat frequency and to train machine learning models. The results showed that the trained model was able to recognize differences between the events created by pesticide-exposed bumblebees and the control bumblebees. This study demonstrates the possibility of the optical sensor for use as a tool to monitor bees that have been exposed to sublethal doses of pesticides. The optical sensor can provide data that could be helpful in managing and, ideally, mitigating the decline of pollinators from one of their most major threats, pesticides.",2023/08//undefined,2023,10.3390/insects14080713,14.0,8,,,2075-4450,WOS:001056919200001,"['acute exposure', 'bumblebees', 'chronic exposure', 'convolutional neural networks', 'infrared sensor', 'insect monitoring', 'pesticide']",,,,,,0,,0,295

We analyze the combined effects of climate warming and sublethal insecticide exposure in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta. Previous Osmia studies show that warm wintering temperatures cause body weight loss, lipid consumption, and fat body depletion. Because the fat body plays a key role in xenobiotic detoxification, we expected that bees exposed to climate warming scenarios would be more sensitive to pesticides. We exposed O. cornuta females to three wintering treatments: current scenario (2007‚Äì2012 temperatures), near-future (2021‚Äì2050 projected temperatures), and distant-future (2051‚Äì2080). Upon emergence in spring, bees were orally exposed to three sublethal doses of an insecticide (Closer, a.i. sulfoxaflor; 0, 4.55 and 11.64 ng a.i./bee). We measured the combined effects of wintering and insecticide exposure on phototactic response, syrup consumption, and longevity. Wintering treatment by itself did not affect winter mortality, but body weight loss increased with increasing wintering temperatures. Similarly, wintering treatment by itself hardly influenced phototactic response or syrup consumption. However, bees wintered at the warmest temperatures had shorter longevity, a strong fecundity predictor in Osmia. Insecticide exposure, especially at the high dose, impaired the ability of bees to respond to light, and resulted in reduced syrup consumption and longevity. The combination of the warmest winter and the high insecticide dose resulted in a 70% longevity decrease. Smaller bees, resulting from smaller pollen‚Äìnectar provisions, had shorter longevity suggesting nutritional stress may further compromise fecundity in O. cornuta. Our results show a synergistic interaction between two major drivers of bee declines, and indicate that bees will become more sensitive to pesticides under the current global warming scenario. Our findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and underscore the need to consider multiple stressors to understand bee declines. ¬© 2023 The Authors.

At the highest doses, we observed larvae and pupae with shorter and longer development times, respectively, and the formation of smaller and asymmetric specimens. Evidently, we need to consider that thiamethoxam reaches the pollen and nectar at residual levels, and that they are processed by nurse bees before destined for offspring.

Recently, there have been efforts to develop a battery of laboratory toxicity tests for a range of non-Apis bee species to directly assess the risk to them. However, it is not clear whether the substantial investment associated with the development and implementation of such routine screening will actually improve the level of protection of non-Apis bees. We argue, using published acute toxicity data from a range of bee species and standard regulatory exposure scenarios, that current first-tier honeybee acute risk assessment schemes utilised by regulatory authorities are protective of other bee species and further tests should be conducted only in cases of concern. We propose similar analysis of alternative exposure scenarios (chronic and developmental) once reliable data for non-Apis bees are available to expand our approach to these scenarios. In addition, we propose that in silico (simulation) approaches can then be used to address population-level effects in more field-realistic scenarios. Such an approach could lead to a protective, but also workable, risk assessment for non-Apis species while contributing to pollination security in agricultural landscapes around the globe.

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT50s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

232,543,JOUR,Neonicotinoids and Optimal Foraging Theory,"['Pyke, G.H.']",Environmental Advances,"Determination of how neonicotinoid ingestion affects the foraging behaviour of flower-visiting animals, and using Optimal Foraging Theory to assess the nature and extent of consequent changes to foraging efficiency, provide a novel approach for understanding how neonic ingestion affects the cognitive abilities of these animals, and their ultimate reproductive success. Neonicotinoids (neonics for short) are used worldwide as insecticides to protect agricultural crops, but may be ingested by non-target flower-visiting animals, such as bees, with negative impacts on their cognitive abilities and consequent adverse effects on their foraging behaviour, reproduction and pollination services. Optimal Foraging Theory may help to understand such effects as it hypothesises that nectar-feeding animals, including bees, will adopt foraging behaviour that maximises net rate of energy intake. Simple models of foraging movements exist but require further development to be useful in this regard. Observed movement patterns could then be compared with predicted patterns, derived from such models, and compared between neonicotinoid-affected and control individuals, with the expectation that control individuals will forage optimally, while neonicotinoid-affected individuals will not exhibit such behaviour and will exhibit reduced foraging success. However, there has been little attempt to develop and test predictions for cognitive foragers, like bees, that are moving between flowers or flower clusters, potentially limiting our ability to manage neonic-use to control agricultural pests. Addressing this gap should lead to enhanced knowledge and understanding of the impacts of neonics on non-target animals, along with other possible flow-on environmental impacts, including possible reductions in pollinator abundance and hence the harvest yields of crops requiring pollination, and could lead to refinements in policy and procedure for future use of neonics to control agricultural pests.

We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested.

Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL‚àí1), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL‚àí1) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL‚àí1) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, RoundUp¬Æ, was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; RoundUp¬Æ showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111108,204.0,,,,,,"['agrochemical', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apis mellifera, imidacloprid', 'Apoidea', 'Article', 'assessment method', 'aversive behavior', 'Aversive conditioning', 'bee', 'Bees', 'circadian rhythm', 'concentration (composition)', 'controlled study', 'crop production', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicity', 'ethion', 'Ethion', 'exposure', 'female', 'forager', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosate', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning', 'lethal concentration', 'lethality', 'lifespan', 'long term exposure', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'motility', 'movement (physiology)', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'newborn', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'pesticide', 'phosphorothioic acid derivative', 'physiology', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'short term exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'survival']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089267499&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111108&partnerID=40&md5=9cbd45dfe10ca45df14df9eba30305df,Scopus,,0,,0,305

The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of imidacloprid, orally, topically, and by contact, on A. mellifera workers and to verify the presence of this active ingredient in honey. Toxicity levels were verified by bioassays. In bioassay 1, the levels correspond to the percentages of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01% of the recommended concentration for field application of the commercial product Nortox¬Æ (active ingredient imidacloprid), with which we obtained the mean lethal concentration (LC50) in 48 h for A. mellifera, determining the concentration ranges to be used in the subsequent bioassays. Bioassays 2 and 3 followed the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which specify the LC50 (48 h). In bioassay 4, the LC50 (48 h) and the survival rate of bees for a period of 120 h were determined by contact with a surface contaminated with imidacloprid, and in bioassay 5, the interference of the insecticide with the flight behavior of bees was evaluated. Honey samples were collected in agroecological and conventional georeferenced apiaries and traces of the imidacloprid were detected by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) with extraction by SPE C18. Bee survival was directly affected by the concentration and exposure time, as well behavioral performance, demonstrating the residual effect of imidacloprid on A. mellifera workers. Honey samples from a conventional apiary showed detection above the maximum residue limits (MRL) allowed by the European Union (0.05 Œºg mL‚àí1), but samples from other apiaries showed no traces of this insecticide.

Exposure to trace levels of these chemicals causes sub-lethal effects, such as reduced learning and foraging efficiency. Complex behaviours may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids. Such behaviours may include buzz pollination (sonication), in which pollinators, usually bees, use innate and learned behaviours to generate high-frequency vibrations to release pollen from flowers with specialised anther morphologies. This study assesses the effect of field-realistic, chronic exposure to the widely-used neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on the development of sonication buzz characteristics over time, as well as the collection of pollen from buzz-pollinated flowers. We found that the pollen collection of exposed bees improved less with increasing experience than that of unexposed bees, with exposed bees collecting between 47% and 56% less pollen by the end of 10 trials. We also found evidence of two distinct strategies for maximising pollen collection: (1) extensions to the duration of individual buzzes and (2) extensions of the overall time spent buzzing. We find new complexities in buzz pollination, and conclude that the impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide may seriously compromise this important ecosystem service.",2017/11/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-14660-x,7.0,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000415166000058,,,,,,,0,,0,308

Unlike plant protection products (PPPs), adjuvants are not subjected to regulatory risk assessment. In practice, numerous combinations of PPPs and adjuvants are therefore possible. Thus, tank mixtures containing insecticides that are classified as non-hazardous to bees up to the highest approved application rate or concentration may raise pollinator safety concerns when mixed with efficacy increasing adjuvants and applied in bee-attractive crops. This study analyzes whether selected ‚ÄúPPP‚Äìadjuvant‚Äù combinations result in increased contact mortality and pose an elevated risk to honey bees. To answer this question, we chose six common spray adjuvants of different classes for laboratory screening. These were then tested in a total of 30 tank mixtures, each with a neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), diamide (chlorantraniliprole), carbamate (pirimicarb), and butenolide (flupyradifurone) formulation. We adapted an acute contact test (OECD Test Guideline 214) to our needs, e.g., by using a professional spray chamber for more realistic exposures. Our results showed that, in total, 50% of all combinations significantly increased the mortality of caged honey bees in comparison with individual application of insecticides. In contrast, none of the adjuvants alone affected bee mortality (Cox proportional hazard model, p > 0.05). With four of the five insecticide formulations, the organosilicone surfactant Break-Thru¬Æ S 301 significantly increased bee mortality within 72¬†h (for all insecticides except chlorantraniliprole). Furthermore, acetamiprid yielded the highest and second highest mortality increases from a tank mixture with the crop oil surfactant LI 700¬Æ (hazard ratio = 28.84, p < 0.05) and the organosilicone Break-Thru¬Æ S 301 (hazard ratio = 14.66, p < 0.05), respectively.

Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-Œ∫B immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-Œ∫B activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-Œ∫B signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.",2013///,2013,10.1073/pnas.1314923110,110.0,46,18466,18471,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887424712&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1314923110&partnerID=40&md5=61f0efc822ad747267dd241f92766f0f,Scopus,,0,,0,310

The interaction between sublethal doses of a neurotoxin, clothianidin, and the ectoparasite, Varroa destructor, was examined by measuring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brains, deformed wing virus (DWV) and the proportion and intensity of self-grooming. Evidence for an interaction was observed between the stressors in a reduction in the proportion of intense groomers. Only the lowest dose of clothianidin alone reduced the proportion of self-groomers and increased DWV levels. V. destructor shared a higher proportion of DEGs with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin, indicating that the effects of V. destructor were more pervasive than those of clothianidin when they were combined. The number of up-regulated DEGs were reduced with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin alone, suggesting an interference with the impacts of clothianidin. Clothianidin and V. destructor affected DEGs from different biological pathways but shared impacts on pathways related to neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer‚Äôs, which could be related to neurological dysfunction and may explain their negative impacts on grooming.

The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is a major pest of olive trees in Mediterranean countries, so spray treatments (cover and bait sprays) are applied for this and other minor pests starting in early spring. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three pesticide spraying solutions (alpha-cypennethrin, dimethoate, and spinosad) and control methods used against olive fruit flies and other olive tree pests, on adult buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The results indicated that exposing worker bumblebees to enviromnentally realistic levels of these active ingredients in the laboratory resulted in high mortality rates of 34% (alpha-cypermethrin, cover spray) and 54% (alpha-cypermethrin, bait spray) at the end of the three-day exposure period. Bumblebees are probably at a high risk of mortality when they forage in olive groves with dry residues of a bait solution of a-cypennethrin (which resulted in 54% mortality in this study). Spinosad and dimethoate posed a lower risk of mortality for bumblebees. However, when the tested chemicals were applied to the whole tree canopy and without the bait attractant, the recorded mortality for dimethoate and a-cypennethrin was 8% and 34%, respectively.

Further, changes in honeybee gut microbial community were examined using next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on day 1, 7, and 13 of the exposure. When compared to control-treatment, continuous exposure to high (0.6 mg/L) and very high (2.0 mg/L) concentrations of thiacloprid significantly reduced percentage survival of honeybees (p < 0.001) and led to dysbiosis of their gut microbial community on day 7 of the exposure. However, during subsequent developmental stages of middle-aged honeybees (i.e. on day 13), their gut microbiome recovered from dysbiosis that occurred previously due to thiacloprid exposure.

Among pesticides, neonicotinoid insecticides are the biggest threat. Due to their extensive use, they can be found in all agricultural environments, including soil, water, and air, are persistent in the environment, and are highly toxic for honey bees. In addition, infection by different pests and pathogens can act synergistically, weakening bees. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid alone or combined with the microsporidia Nosema ceranae on the immune response, deformed wing virus infection (DWV), gut microbiota, and survival of Africanized honey bees. We found that imidacloprid affected the expression of some genes associated with immunity generating an altered physiological state, although it did not favor DWV or N. ceranae infection. The pesticide alone did not affect honey bee gut microbiota, as previously suggested, but when administered to N. ceranae infected bees, it generated significant changes.

Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, are widely regarded as a substantial contributing factor to the decline in bumblebee populations, as evidenced by the detrimental impacts documented across many stages of their life cycle. Mating is vital for the population maintenance of bumblebees. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research conducted on the effects of pesticides on the mating process. In this study, we individually examined the impact of imidacloprid on the mating behavior of bumblebee males and queens. A competitive mating experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect on the competitive prowess of male individuals and the mate selection behavior of female individuals. The study revealed that the mating rate of bumblebees exposed to a concentration of 10 ppb of imidacloprid was 3 %. This finding demonstrated a statistically significant impact when compared to the control group, which exhibited a mating rate of 58 % in the normal mating experiment. Furthermore, in the competitive mating experiment, we found that the competitive mating success rate of treated males (1 %) was significantly lower than that of untreated males (35 %). Hence, it provides evidence that neonicotinoid imidacloprid negatively affects bumblebee mating success and cautions us to protect bumblebees from pesticide exposure to prevent a severe impact on their populations.",2024/06/10/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172525,928.0,,,,0048-9697,WOS:001233768300001,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'Imidacloprids', 'pesticide residue', 'reproduction', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'Male', 'Reproduction', 'Imidacloprid', 'experimental study', 'sexual behavior', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal', 'ecological impact', 'Female', 'queen (insect)', 'pesticide exposure', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'Population statistics', 'physiological stress', 'seasonal variation', 'Bombu terrestri', 'duration', 'latent period', 'life cycle', 'Life cycle', 'mate choice', 'mating', 'Mating duration', 'Mating latency', 'Mating rate', 'mating success', 'Matings', 'Natural environments', 'relative humidity', 'sex difference', 'sexual maturity']",,,,,,0,,0,317

In insects, these neonicotinoid insecticides are known to act on acetylcholine nicotinic receptors but the behavioral effects of low doses are not yet fully understood. The effects of acetamiprid and thiamethoxam were studied after acute sublethal treatment on the behavior of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) under controlled laboratory conditions. The drugs were either administered orally or applied topically on the thorax. After oral consumption acetamiprid increased sensitivity to antennal stimulation by sucrose solutions at doses of 1 Œºg/bee and impaired long-term retention of olfactory learning at the dose of 0.1 Œºg/bee. Acetamiprid thoracic application induced no effect in these behavioral assays but increased locomotor activity (0.1 and 0.5 Œºg/bee) and water-induced proboscis extension reflex (0.1, 0.5, and 1 Œºg/bee).

One of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Although the primary mode of action of imidacloprid is on the insect nervous system, it has also been shown to cause changes in insects' digestive physiology and alter the microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The honey bee gut microbiome plays a major role in bee health. Although many studies have shown that imidacloprid affects honey bee behavior, its impact on the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the gut microbiome composition, survivorship, and susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees. Consistent with other studies, we show that imidacloprid exposure results in an elevated mortality of honey bees in the hive and increases the susceptibility to infection by pathogens. However, we did not find evidence that imidacloprid affects the gut bacterial community of honey bees. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that honey bee gut bacteria can grow in the presence of imidacloprid, and we found some evidence that imidacloprid can be metabolized in the bee gut environment. However, none of the individual bee gut bacterial species tested could metabolize imidacloprid, suggesting that the observed metabolism of imidacloprid within in vitro bee gut cultures is not caused by the gut bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that imidacloprid causes increased mortality in honey bees, but this mortality does not appear to be linked to the microbiome. ¬© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",2018///,2018,10.1128/AEM.00545-18,84.0,13,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049378480&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00545-18&partnerID=40&md5=194e8ae4e1486d395f126789a311f728,Scopus,,0,,0,319

Frequent exposure to toxic pesticides is one of the major risk factors causing the pollinator population decline. However, age effects of honey bees on pesticide susceptibility have been largely ignored and many researchers use bees of unknown age for assessing the risk of pesticides. Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108844,238.0,,,,,,"['acephate', 'age', 'Age', 'Age Factors', 'aging', 'Aging', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'beta fructofuranosidase', 'beta-Fructofuranosidase', 'carbamic acid derivative', 'cyhalothrin', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'Detoxification enzymes', 'drug sensitivity', 'enzyme activity', 'enzymology', 'esterase', 'Esterases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'insecticide resistance', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'Insecticides', 'Invertase', 'metabolism', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'nonhuman', 'organophosphate insecticide', 'oxamyl', 'priority journal', 'pyrethroid', 'Soluble protein', 'Worker']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089262289&doi=10.1016%2fj.cbpc.2020.108844&partnerID=40&md5=01cf9a35d7021a7a9303c0b2f05f247f,Scopus,,0,,0,320
136,703,JOUR,Sugar content of diet does not buffer against chronic oral imidacloprid exposure in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),"['Cecala, J.M.', 'Baronia, D.A.', 'Wilson Rankin, E.E.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Bees are economically critical pollinators, but are declining broadly due to several stressors, including nontarget exposure to insecticides and deficiencies in nutrition. Understanding the simultaneous impact of stressors, particularly interactions between them, is critical to effectively conserving bees. Although behavioral effects of pesticides like neonicotinoids have received some attention in solitary bees, our understanding of how they are modulated by diet quality is limited. Furthermore, scarce data exist on what concentrations of orally ingested neonicotinoids elicit mortality in solitary bees. In a controlled exposure laboratory experiment, we investigated how diet quality, as sugar concentration, and chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid affect adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius). We provided individuals ad libitum with either 20 or 50% (m/m) sucrose syrups containing either 0, 30, or 300 ppb imidacloprid (measuring 0, 27, and 209 ppb via an ELISA assay). Over 5 wk, we tracked behavior and survivorship of individuals. Imidacloprid decreased survivorship in a dose-dependent fashion, but sucrose content did not affect survivorship, even in bees not fed imidacloprid. In the high imidacloprid treatment, 45% of bees were observed in a motionless supine position while still alive, with this effect appearing to be buffered against by the higher sucrose diet. Our results suggest that diets higher in sugar concentration may prevent an intermediate stage of poisoning, but do not ultimately extend longevity. In devising risk assessments for bees, it is important to consider that interactions between stressors may occur in the stages leading up to death even if survivorship is unaffected. ¬© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this context, the use of insecticides with lower residuals and less harmful effects to bees is fundamental. Thus, the objective of the current work was to evaluate, in a laboratory bioassay, the residual toxicity and effect of imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and a mixture of both, when applied on canola in the field, on Africanized A. mellifera workers. Three commercial products were applied, formulated with imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid. Each plot received one of the three treatments, in the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at intervals between 14 and 0¬†days prior to conducting the bioassays. On the day of the bioassay, the bees were exposed to the plant material containing the treatments for a period of two hours, and were transferred to PVC cages, containing food and water. Mortality assessments were then performed at pre-established intervals until a 96¬†h post-exposure. Residuals on canola leaves of all tested products caused a significant reduction of honeybee worker longevity, which was less accentuated when the interval after treatment application increased.

Notably, a diverse range of potential sublethal effects have been reported in bee species, with a particular focus on effects due to exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, a purpose-built thermal‚Äìvisual arena was used in a series of pilot experiments to assess the potential impact of approximate sublethal concentrations of the next generation sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor (5 and 50 ppb) and the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid (500 ppb) and thiamethoxam (10 ppb), on the walking trajectory, navigation and learning abilities of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris audax) when subjected to an aversive conditioning task. The results suggest that only thiamethoxam prevents forager bees from improving in key training parameters (speed and distanced travelled) within the thermal visual arena. Power law analyses further revealed that a speed‚Äìcurvature power law, previously reported as being present in the walking trajectories of bumblebees, is potentially disrupted under thiamethoxam (10 ppb) exposure, but not under sulfoxaflor or thiacloprid exposure.

However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./mu L) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./mu L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

At the 48 h interval, our results showed that 1) the order of toxicities for the single insecticides was ranked as clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran and that 2) all binary and ternary combinations showed synergism or additive effect at the effect (fa) 0.5. Therefore, our results not only provided meaningful guidelines in evaluating the safety risk of the mixtures of the three neonicotinoids towards honeybees but also suggested that there is a significant interest in the study of mixture toxicities of neonicotinoids against honeybees because risk assessment of neonicotinoids against honeybees conducted only in individual insecticides may underestimate the realistic toxicity. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.045,184.0,,806,811,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020932175&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2017.06.045&partnerID=40&md5=8cc145d5135b142090e86f1031ee7bdb,Scopus,,0,,0,329

97,694,JOUR,"Time-dependent effects on bumble bees of dietary exposures to farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil)","['Mulvey, J.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Farmland bees encounter insecticides in their diet when visiting the flowers of pesticide-treated crops with residues in nectar and pollen. A sustained exposure to even trace residues could be severely harmful if the ingested substance has a long biological half-life and its toxicity therefore intensifies over time, which is termed time-reinforced toxicity (TRT). Bumble bees are important farmland pollinators, but their susceptibility to TRT from insecticides has not been established previously. This study therefore investigated the potential for three farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil) to generate TRT in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) by dietary exposure in the laboratory using lethality as an endpoint under both fixed-dose and pulsed-dose regimes. RESULTS: The insecticides varied in toxic effect. Fipronil exposures produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity (days of exposure survived) and strong TRT with no evidence of clearance-based recovery. Thiamethoxam exposures also produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity, but with moderate TRT and evidence of some clearance-based recovery. Imidacloprid exposures produced a hormesis with reduced longevity only at the highest doses and an absence of TRT. CONCLUSION: Our study further confirms the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. Our findings suggest that regulatory oversight of pesticides will better safeguard bee health by testing the active ingredients of farmland agrochemicals for their capacity to produce TRT in these ecologically important nontarget organisms. Our study demonstrates the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bumble bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. ¬© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",2020///,2020,10.1002/ps.5838,76.0,8,2846,2853,,,"['agricultural land', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apoidea', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus (genus)', 'Bombus terrestris', 'diet', 'Diet', 'dietary exposure', 'Dietary Exposure', 'dietary intake', 'ecotoxicology', 'Farms', 'fipronil', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'longevity', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoids', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinators', 'pyrazole derivative', 'Pyrazoles', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'time dependent behavior', 'time reinforcement', 'toxicity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084042182&doi=10.1002%2fps.5838&partnerID=40&md5=8fb2e37720e159166211042ced5ab260,Scopus,,0,,0,331

540,562,JOUR,A neonicotinoid pesticide alters how nectar chemistry affects bees,"['Richman, S.K.', 'Maalouf, I.M.', 'Smilanich, A.M.', 'Marquez Sanchez, D.', 'Miller, S.Z.', 'Leonard, A.S.']",Functional Ecology,"Neonicotinoid pesticides in the nectar and pollen of managed crops and wildflowers contribute to the global declines of bees. These chemicals can have detrimental effects on bees' physiology, behaviour and reproduction. Floral nectar also contains secondary chemistry with its own effects on bee health. How nectar secondary chemistry may act additively or synergistically with neonicotinoids is unknown. Here, we asked how an acute exposure to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid (IMD) affected the longevity, immune function and behaviour of bumble bee Bombus impatiens workers maintained on diets enriched with one of three nectar secondary metabolites (NSMs; the alkaloid caffeine, the terpenoid thymol or the cardiac glycoside digoxin). A factorial design allowed us to assess the potential for additive and interactive effects of each NSM and IMD combination on multiple health outcomes. Without IMD exposure, different dietary NSMs each had positive effects on life span (caffeine), immune function (digoxin) and activity levels (caffeine, thymol), although these came with trade-offs. A single sublethal IMD exposure overshadowed these NSM effects, and in two cases, an NSM-enriched diet magnified the negative effects of pesticide exposure. In summary, we show that even a single acute exposure to a pesticide has the potential to reshape interactions between pollinators and plants mediated by nectar secondary chemistry.

These factors have been found to have strong and often interacting negative effects on multiple pollinator species in laboratory based studies, however their interactions in the field are less clear. To try and understand the link between pesticide use on pollinator communities, and how this might impact on disease transmission, we took two complementary approaches. First, we undertook a series of pollinator surveys to assess the abundance and diversity of pollinator groups across British agricultural field sites subject to varying levels of pesticide use. We then screened the offspring of two taxa of tube nesting solitary bees (Osmiabicomis and Megachile spp.) for three parasite groups commonly associated with pollinators. We found lower pollinator abundance, group richness and diversity across agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use. Specifically, there were fewer honey bees, hoverflies, solitary bees and wasps. Surprisingly, we found a lower prevalence of all three parasite groups in O. bicomis offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. We also found a lower prevalence of Ascosphaera but a higher prevalence of Microsporidia in Megachile offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. Together, our results suggest that agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use may be affecting pollinators indirectly by disrupting community structure and influencing disease epidemiology and vectoring opportunities. This highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between pesticide use and disease in both managed and wild bee populations for the future mitigation of pollinator declines.",2018/04/15/,2018,10.1016/j.agee.2018.02.002,258.0,,40,48,0167-8809,WOS:000429394600005,,,,,,,0,,0,334

The honey bee is a unique keystone species because its pollination activities are not only necessary for the viability of many flowering plant species in the wild, but are also necessary for many human agricultural practices. The increasing prevalence of CCD is a threat to the economic and nutritional security of all societies that rely on efficient pollination for large monoculture crops. Although there is ample evidence that Varroa mites, pesticides, disease, and climate change contribute to CCD, only a few studies have investigated the contribution of synergism across multiple factors to the development of CCD and CCD-like symptoms. However, there is increasing acknowledgement in the scientific community that synergism across different factors affects honey bee colony health and behavior. Here, we provide evidence that sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid neonicotinoid pesticide reduce learning and memory capabilities.

36,385,JOUR,"Sublethal acetamiprid exposure induces immunity, suppresses pathways linked to juvenile hormone synthesis in queens and affects cycle-related signaling in emerging bees","['Erban, T.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Sopko, B.']",Environmental Pollution,"Acetamiprid is the only neonicotinoid registered in the European Union because the risks of neonicotinoids to honey bees and other pollinators are strictly regulated. Herein, we orally exposed honey bee colonies to sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid (20 Œºg/L) under isolated conditions. After one month of continuous exposure, the emerging bees and queens were collected and analyzed via high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics using a data-independent acquisition strategy. Six and 34 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the emerging bees and queens, respectively. Mrjp3 was the only DEP found in both sample types/castes, and its opposite regulation illustrated a differential response. The DEPs in the emerging bees (H/ACA RNP, Rap1GAP, Mrjp3, and JHE) suggested that sublethal exposure to acetamiprid affected cell cycle-related signaling, which may affect the life history of workers in the colony. The DEPs with increased levels in queens, such as Mrjps 1‚Äì4 and 6‚Äì7, hymenoptaecin, and apidaecin 22, indicated an activated immune response. Additionally, the level of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the mevalonate pathway and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in queens. The impaired utilization of juvenile hormone in queens supported the identification of additional DEPs. Furthermore, the proteome changes suggested the existence of increased neonicotinoid detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and increased amino acid metabolism. The results suggest that the continuous exposure of bee colonies to acetamiprid at low doses (nanograms per gram in feed) may pose a threat to the colonies. The different exposure routes and durations for the emerging bees and queens in our experiment must be considered, i.e., the emerging bees were exposed as larvae via feeding royal jelly and beebread provided by workers (nurse bees), whereas the queens were fed royal jelly throughout the experiment. The biological consequences of the proteomic changes resulting from sublethal/chronic exposure require future determination. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123901,349.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'apidaecin 22', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Biochemistry', 'bioinformatics', 'biosynthesis', 'cell cycle', 'Cell signaling', 'chromatography', 'Chronic exposure', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (composition)', 'Continuous exposure', 'data independent acquisition', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'differential expression analysis', 'differentially expressed protein', 'drug effect', 'false discovery rate', 'farnesyl diphosphate', 'farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase', 'female', 'Female', 'functional enrichment analysis', 'glucuronosyltransferase', 'H/ ACA RNP', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'Honey bee', 'hormone synthesis', 'hymenoptaecin', 'imidacloprid', 'immunity', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'JHE', 'juvenile hormone', 'Juvenile hormone', 'juvenile hormone synthesis', 'Juvenile Hormones', 'KEGG', 'larva', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'long term exposure', 'Molecular biology', 'Mrjp3', 'Mrjps 1', 'Mrjps 2', 'Mrjps 3', 'Mrjps 4', 'Mrjps 6', 'Mrjps 7', 'nanoliquid chromatography', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'proteomics', 'Proteomics', 'queen (insect)', 'Rap1GAP', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'royal jelly', 'Royal jelly', 'signal transduction', 'Signal Transduction', 'sublethal concentration', 'sublethal effect', 'synthetase', 'thiamethoxam', 'unclassified drug', ""Workers'""]",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189754379&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.123901&partnerID=40&md5=0ef2ce1fe730183f9cf7fa2ed927a347,Scopus,,0,,0,336

However, little is known about how this agonist affects two specific aspects of foraging: sucrose responsiveness (SR) and waggle dancing (which recruits nestmates). Using lab and field experiments, we tested the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on (1) bee SR with the proboscis extension response assay, and (2) free-flying foragers visiting and dancing for a sucrose feeder. Bees that ingested imidacloprid (0.21 or 2.16 ng bee -1) had higher sucrose response thresholds 1 h after treatment. Foragers that ingested imidacloprid also produced significantly fewer waggle dance circuits (10.5- and 4.5-fold fewer for 50% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively) 24 h after treatment as compared with controls. However, there was no significant effect of imidacloprid on the sucrose concentrations that foragers collected at a feeder 24 h after treatment. Thus, imidacloprid temporarily increased the minimum sucrose concentration that foragers would accept (short time scale, 1 h after treatment) and reduced waggle dancing (longer time scale, 24 h after treatment). The effect of time suggests different neurological effects of imidacloprid resulting from the parent compound and its metabolites. Waggle dancing can significantly increase colony food intake, and thus a sublethal dose (0.21 ng bee -1, 24 p.p.b.) of this commonly used pesticide may impair colony fitness. ¬© 2012 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",2012///,2012,10.1242/jeb.068718,215.0,12,2022,2029,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862509996&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.068718&partnerID=40&md5=a49fa590d0ca066e31d284c615c955e3,Scopus,,0,,0,337

Over three years, we assessed the ecotoxicological impacts on the diversity and abundance of bees and syrphid flies between reduced-risk pesticide programs and standard, conventional pesticide programs in paired plots at six spatially distinct commercial apple orchards. In particular, we quantified pesticide inputs, environmental impact, and community response of bees and syrphids to these pesticide programs. Relative environmental impacts of reduced-risk versus conventional pesticide programs were calculated using Environmental Impact Quotient analysis, while ecological impacts were characterized by assessing the abundance, richness, and species assemblages of bees and syrphids. Adopting a reduced-risk pesticide program for apple pest management reduced the use (in terms of kg a.i./ha) of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides by approximately 97.6% and 100% respectively, but increased the use of neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid) by 40.4% compared to the orchards under standard conventional pesticide program. Regardless of pesticide inputs, abundance, richness and species assemblages of bees and syrphids did not differ between reduced-risk and conventional pest management programs. However, the environmental impact of pesticide inputs was reduced by 89.8% in reduced-risk pesticide program. These findings suggest that the implementation of reduced-risk pesticide program may reduce pesticide environmental impact, in addition to being safer to farm workers, without adversely affecting the robust community composition of bees and syrphids in commercial apple orchards in the mid-Atlantic region.

Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication. Here we show that exposure to the field-relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid caused a reduction in bumblebee foraging activity, locomotion, and foraging rhythmicity.

Stingless bees are wild pollinators restricted to the Pantropical region, and like honey bees, are suffering colony losses. However, stingless bees and honey bees do not show the same behaviors, therefore, methods used for risk assessment of honey bees cannot be utilized on stingless bees. Herein, we describe protocols to standardize methods that allow for the exploration of lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals via acute and chronic exposure of stingless bees. The in vitro rearing used for chronic exposure from the egg to the adult stage proved to be effective in obtaining relevant screenings.

For substances like fertilizers, usually no information on potential side effects on bees is available. Initially, effects from tank mixes containing insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers were investigated under laboratory conditions by use of a spray chamber contact test. For selected combinations, higher tier studies were carried out. Mixtures containing thiacloprid, boscalid and dimoxystrobin with boron fertilizers showed no increase of mortality. In contrast, tank mixes of thiacloprid formulations and EBI-fungicides resulted within 24¬†h in synergistic mortality increase in laboratory, semi-field and field. Actually, a short time interval of 24¬†h between individually applied potentially synergistic products like pyrethroid insecticides and EBI fungicides led to an increase of mortality up to 100% under laboratory conditions, indicating that the detoxification was still ongoing, resulting in an increased susceptibility for other stressors during the metabolization process. In conclusion, tank mixtures do not always lead to an increase of honey bee¬†toxicity. However, former published findings about synergistic impacts between neonicotinoides and EBI-fungicides could be confirmed. The findings of our and other higher tier studies finally prompted the competent regulatory authority (BVL) to regulate these mixtures by restriction NB6613 since September 2018.

Regarding the honey bees, beekeepers can be hampered by decreased production of honey and other bee products. Although the effects of insecticides on bees are widely studied for obvious reasons, there is growing evidence that fungicides, too, are not harmless to bees. However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees. For this reason, we aimed to perform a histopathological diagnosis and cell death immunolabeling in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Africanized honey bee workers throughout continuous oral exposure (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h) to low concentrations of picoxystrobin (9 ppb and 18 ppb), a strobilurin fungicide.

This research aimed to evaluate the effects of thiamethoxam on the immune system cells of Bombus terrestris workers. Different ratios of 1/1000, 1/100 and 1/10 of the recommended maximum application dose of thiamethoxam formed the experimental groups. Ten foraging workers were used for each dose and control groups. Contamination was ensured by spraying the prepared suspensions at different ratios to the bees for 20¬†s at a pressure of 1¬†atm. The effects of thiamethoxam on the structures of immune system cells of bumblebees and the amount of these cells were investigated after 48¬†h of exposure. In general, anomalies such as vacuolization, cell membrane irregularities and cell shape changes were detected in prohemocyte, plasmatocyte, granulocyte, spherulocyte and oenocytoid in each dose group. Hemocyte area measurements in all groups were examined comparatively between groups. In general, granulocyte and plasmatocyte sizes were decreased, while spherulocyte and oenocytoid were increased. It was also determined that there was a significant decrease in the amount of hemocytes in the 1 mm3 hemolymph as dose increased.

Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed.

This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of ‚àº4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively. These results suggest that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula.

Neonicotinoid insecticides are one of the most widely used pesticides in tomato crops in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of four neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) to bumblebees based on the OECD guidelines (No.246, 247). The 48 hr LD50 (Œºg a.i. /bumblebee) values in the acute contact toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.467; dinotefuran, 3.741; imidacloprid, 3.967; and thiamethoxam, 0.747. The 48 hr LD50 values in the acute oral toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.005; dinotefuran, 0.056; imidacloprid, 0.325; and thiamethoxam, 0.018. The acute contact and oral toxicity of the test insecticides to bumblebees from most to least toxic was clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran > imidacloprid.

One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria.

For this purpose, tagged bees were exposed to DWV by feeding or injection, and/or to field-relevant doses of thiamethoxam, then left in colonies equipped with optical bee counters to monitor flight activity. DWV loads and the expression of immune genes were quantified. A reduction in vitellogenin expression level was observed in DWV-injected bees and was associated with precocious onset of foraging. Combined exposure to DWV and thiamethoxam did not result in higher DWV loads compared to bees only exposed to DWV, but induced precocious foraging, increased the risk of not returning to the hive after the first flight, and decreased survival when compared to single stress exposures.

Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis. FPF exposure (4 and 12 mg/L) led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activity.

We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 ŒºL 1¬†M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 ŒºL of 1.5¬†M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 ŒºL 0.5¬†M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30¬†min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed. We observed acute, mild effects on foraging by honey bees, so mild that storage of imidacloprid tainted-honey is very plausible and likely to be found in honey bee colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2015///,2015,10.1007/s10646-015-1537-2,24.0,9,2017,2025,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948105114&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-015-1537-2&partnerID=40&md5=9c6be28f653d8d0189fb78790d94c8dd,Scopus,,0,,0,354

The study disclosed that H. armigera (larvae) crossed ETL (Economic Threshold Level) from 10th SW (Standard Week), warranting application of pest management measures. Many pollinator species were observed foraging on sunflowers during the same time. The least foraging by pollinators was recorded in early morning and late evening hours, depicting avoidance of insecticide application when pollinator foraging activity is maximum. A combination of synthetic and bio-insecticides (Chlorantraniliprole, Bt-kurstaki, Emamectin-benzoate, Spinosad, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Novaluron, and Neem-oil) were tested for their efficacy against H. armigera and impact on foraging behaviour of pollinators. Bio-insecticide-treated plots recorded significantly higher number of foraging pollinators as compared to synthetic-insecticide-treated plots.

118,839,JOUR,Acute toxicity of five pesticides to Apis mellifera larvae reared in vitro,"['Dai, P.', 'Jack, C.J.', 'Mortensen, A.N.', 'Ellis, J.D.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: The reported high loss rates of managed honey bee colonies have been attributed to diverse stressors including pesticides. Honey bee larvae can be exposed to pesticides in contaminated nectar, pollen and wax. Due to the difficulties of rearing larvae in vitro, research focusing on adult bee exposure to pesticides is more common than that on larva exposure to pesticides. Herein, we aimed to assess the acute toxicity of five insecticides to honey bee larvae using an improved in vitro rearing method. RESULTS: LC50 and LD50 were calculated for larvae at 72 h following a single diet exposure administered when the larvae were 84 ¬± 12 h old. Solvent control larval mortalities were less than 15% at 72 h. The LC50 values (mg L‚àí1) for each tested pesticide were as follows: amitraz, 494.27; chlorpyrifos, 15.39; coumaphos, 90.01; fluvalinate, 27.69; and imidacloprid, 138.84. The LD50 values in ¬µg per larva were 14.83 (amitraz), 0.46 (chlorpyrifos), 2.70 (coumaphos), 0.83 (fluvalinate) and 4.17 (imidacloprid). CONCLUSION: The toxicity of the test pesticides to honey bee larvae from most to least toxic was chlorpyrifos > fluvalinate > coumaphos = imidacloprid > amitraz. ¬© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2017///,2017,10.1002/ps.4608,73.0,11,2282,2286,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030637650&doi=10.1002%2fps.4608&partnerID=40&md5=ee7f2db1e6235eb04039794de4ae7785,Scopus,,0,,0,356

These insecticides, however, show very strong toxicity to pollinating insects and in particular to the honey bee, besides causing also other effects which are often not easily identifiable, such as behavioural disturbances, orientation difficulties, and impairment of social activities. During the past few years, in many countries, alarming bee mortality rates were recorded. In some cases this was clearly due to the use of neonicotinoids either for seed dressing or crop spraying. It was therefore considered appropriate to test on three strains of Apis mellifera of Piedmontese origin and referable to A. in. ligustica in the laboratory both the acute oral toxicity of Imidacloprid, which had been, in use for many years, and Clothianidin and Thiametoxam, only more recently introduced in Italy.

They were tested at the recommended concentration for field treatments. When mortality was higher in the tested bees than in the untreated ones, the active ingredients were tested at gradually decreasing concentrations so as to reach a mortality not significantly different from that found in the untreated controls.

European foulbrood, caused by the bacterium Melissococcus plutonius, is a disease of honeybee larvae which causes economic hardship for commercial beekeepers, in particular those whose colonies pollinate blueberries. We report for the first time in Canada, an atypical variant of M. plutonius isolated from a blueberry-pollinating colony. With this isolate, we used an in vitro larval infection system to study the effects of pesticide exposure on the development of European foulbrood disease. Pesticide doses tested were excessive (thiamethoxam and pyrimethanil) or maximal field-relevant (propiconazole and boscalid). We found that chronic exposure to the combination of thiamethoxam and propiconazole significantly decreased the survival of larvae infected with M. plutonius, while larvae chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and/or boscalid or pyrimethanil did not experience significant increases in mortality from M. plutonius infection in vitro. Based on these results, individual, calculated field-realistic residues of thiamethoxam and/or boscalid or pyrimethanil are unlikely to increase mortality from European foulbrood disease in honeybee worker brood, while the effects of field-relevant exposure to thiamethoxam and propiconazole on larval mortality from European foulbrood warrant further study.",2020/04//undefined,2020,10.3390/insects11040252,11.0,4,,,2075-4450,WOS:000533910800043,,,,,,,0,,0,360

Honey bees get exposed to systemic pesticides while foraging in contaminated fields, and it is important to know the toxicity (LD50) and evaluate the impacts of bees' exposure to these molecules. Fipronil and imidacloprid are systemic pesticides widely used in Brazil and other countries. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50 (24 hours) and evaluate motor changes in Africanized honey bee foragers exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of fipronil and imidacloprid. To determine the LD50, foraging honey bees were exposed by ingestion and contact to five doses of fipronil (Regent 800WG¬∞) and imidacloprid (Appalus 200SC¬∞) insecticides. After 24 hours of exposure, the number of dead bees was counted, and the results were subjected to probit analysis. The motor activity of bees exposed by ingestion or contact to LD50 and sublethal doses (1/500th of the LD50) of both pesticides was assessed 4 hours after exposure using a behavioral observation box. The ingestion and contact with LD50 of fipronil were 0.0528¬±0.0090 and 0.0054¬±0.0041 Œºg/bee, respectively; the ingestion and contact with LD50 of imidacloprid were 0.0809¬±0.0135 and 0.0626¬±0.0080 Œºg/bee, respectively.

When used at the field-recommended rates, both copper sulfate (200¬†¬µg of active ingredient/bee; a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) and spinosad (8.16 a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) caused a decrease in bee survival, while glyphosate (148 a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) did not show any significant effects.

Emergent honeybees received a daily dose of insecticide ranging from one-fifth to one-five-hundredth of the median lethal dose (LD50) during 11 d. After exposure to fipronil (0.1 and 0.01 ng/bee), acetamiprid (1 and 0.1 Œºg/bee), or thiamethoxam (1 and 0.1 ng/bee), behavioral functions of honeybees were tested on day 12. Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open-field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant. Thiamethoxam by contact induced either a significant decrease of olfactory memory 24 h after learning at 0.1 ng/bee or a significant impairment of learning performance with no effect on memory at 1 ng/bee. Responsiveness to antennal sucrose stimulation was significantly decreased for high sucrose concentrations in honeybees treated orally with thiamethoxam (1 ng/bee). The only significant effect of acetamiprid (administered orally, 0.1 Œºg/bee) was an increase in responsiveness to water. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam tested at the highest dose (one-tenth and one-fifth of their oral LD50, respectively) and fipronil at one-five-hundredth of LD50 have limited effects on the motor, sensory, and cognitive functions of the honeybee.

In 2018 the European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the name of Sivanto was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless, flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone (830 mu mol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2 mu g/bee). These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0-1.75 mu g) continuously over 24h with food the observed effects are slighter. For comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this pesticide (4ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",2019/04//undefined,2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02028-y,28.0,3,354,366,0963-9292,WOS:000462001000009,,,,,,,0,,0,364

Compared with the well-studied roles of these pesticides in nontarget site (including midgut, ovary, or salivary glands), little has been reported in the target sites, the brain. In the current study, laboratory-reared adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL technique for DNA labeling. We observed significantly increased apoptotic markers in dose- and time-dependent manners in brains of bees exposed to imidacloprid. Neuronal activated caspase-3 and mRNA levels of caspase-1, as detected by immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively, were significantly increased, suggesting that sublethal doses of imidacloprid may induce the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the overlap of apoptosis and autophagy in neurons was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It further suggests that a relationship exists between neurotoxicity and behavioral changes induced by sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that there is a need to determine reasonable limits for imidacloprid application in the field to protect pollinators. ¬© The Authors 2015.

Toxicity data are submitted to support these assessments and the USEPA maintains a large database containing acute and chronic toxicity data on adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera), which USEPA considers a surrogate for Apis and non-Apis bees. We compared these toxicity data to explore possible trends. This analysis indicated a significant correlation between acute contact and oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for adult honey bees (œÅ = 0.74, p <0.0001). Using default EPA modeling assumptions, where exposure for an individual bee is roughly 12x lower through contact than through ingestion, the analysis indicates that the oral LD50 is similarly if not more protective of the contact LD50 for the majority of pesticides and modes of action evaluated. The analysis also provided evidence that compounds with a lower acute toxicity for adults through contact and oral exposure pathways may still be acutely toxic for larvae. The acute toxicity of herbicides and fungicides was higher for larvae relative to oral and contact toxicity for adult honey bees for the same compounds and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from chronic toxicity studies were lower for larvae relative to adults, indicating increased sensitivity of larvae. When comparing 8-day LD50 values between single dose larval acute studies to those derived from repeat dose 22-day larval chronic toxicity studies, the LD50 values derived from chronic studies were significantly lower than those from acute toxicity tests (Z = -37, p = 0.03).

Certain phytochemicals, including quercetin and p-coumaric acid, are ubiquitous in the honey bee diet and are known to upregulate cytochrome P450 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify insecticides. Thus, the possibility exists that these dietary phytochemicals interact with ingested imidacloprid to ameliorate toxicity by enhancing its detoxification. Approach Quercetin and p-coumaric acid were incorporated in a phytochemical-free artificial diet individually and together along with imidacloprid at a range of field-realistic concentrations. In acute toxicity bioassays, honey bee 24-and 48-hour imidacloprid LC50 values were determined in the presence of the phytochemicals. Additionally, chronic toxicity bioassays were conducted using varying concentrations of imidacloprid in diets with the phytochemicals to test impacts of phytochemicals on longevity. Results In acute toxicity bioassays, the phytochemicals had no effect on imidacloprid LC50 values. In chronic toxicity longevity bioassays, phytochemicals enhanced honey bee survival at low imidacloprid concentrations (15 and 45 ppb) but had a negative effect at higher concentrations (105 ppb and 135 ppb). p-Coumaric acid alone increased honey bee longevity at concentrations of 15 and 45 ppb imidacloprid (hazard ratio (HR): 0.83 and 0.70, respectively). Quercetin alone and in combination with p-coumaric acid similarly enhanced longevity at 45 ppb imidacloprid (HR:0.81 and HR:0.77, respectively). However, p-coumaric acid in combination with 105 ppb imidacloprid and quercetin in combination with 135 ppb imidacloprid increased honey bee HR by approximately 30% (HR:1.33 and HR:1.30, respectively). Conclusions The biphasic concentration-dependent response of honey bees to imidacloprid in the presence of two ubiquitous dietary phytochemicals indicates that there are limits to the protective effects of the natural diet of honey bees against neonicotinoids based on their own inherent toxicity. ¬© 2018 Wong et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",2018///,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0206625,13.0,11,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055913454&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0206625&partnerID=40&md5=6bc8adf41daeac66b0b0bc0638b06f71,Scopus,,0,,0,367

For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ‚â• 500 Œºg kg‚àí1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ‚â§ 20 Œºg kg‚àí1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins. It has been shown a correlation between pesticide exposure and a decrease of some neuropeptides and other head peptides in honey bees. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.091,235.0,,750,760,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041685050&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2017.12.091&partnerID=40&md5=af5b9fa3b3bedf115c723cb3cb6917f4,Scopus,,0,,0,368

Native bees in neotropical regions belong to the Meliponini tribe, a larger group that differs significantly in behavior and biology from honeybees (e.g., Apis mellifera) and solitary bees (e.g., Osmia spp.). Hence, the exposure and effects of pesticides is also likely to vary among these different species. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to determine the presence of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the Brazilian native stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula (local common name: Jata√≠). The method used for the chemical analysis involved a QuEChERS technique combined with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The developed method was subsequently used to analyze collected field samples. In addition, the acute toxicity of the pesticide to T. angustula was evaluated in a laboratory bioassay evaluating both lethal and sublethal endpoints. The analytical method was successfully developed with detection and quantification limits of 1.55 and 5 Œºg L‚àí1, respectively, along with a linear range of 1‚Äì5 ng mL‚àí1. Clothianidin was detected in environmental samples (9.2‚Äì32.9 ng g‚àí1), and the exposure experiments demonstrated acute oral toxicity to adults of T. angustula, (24 h-LD50 of 0.16 ng a.i./bee), as well as no significative interference in acetylcholinesterase activity. Considering the obtained toxicity endpoints for T. angustula and those reported in the literature for other bee species, this study revealed that T. angustula is more (lethally) sensitive to clothianidin than other bee species, including those commonly used in environmental risk assessment studies. This thus also supports the call for using native test species in (regional) risk assessment evaluations. ¬© 2023",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140878,349.0,,,,,,"['acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'Agricultural crops', 'analytic method', 'analytical method', 'Analytical method', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apidae', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'behavioral response', 'bioassay', 'biodiversity', 'Biodiversity', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'chemical analysis', 'Chromatography', 'clothianidin', 'comparative study', 'Crops', 'drug analysis', 'electrospray', 'environmental risk', 'enzyme activity', 'enzyme substrate', 'feeding behavior', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Large groups', 'LD50', 'lethality', 'limit of detection', 'limit of quantitation', 'mouth cavity', 'MS/MS analysis', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Neotropics', 'nerve conduction', 'nonhuman', 'Oral toxicity', 'Osmia', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'QuEChERS', 'retention time', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'stingless bee', 'Stingless bee', 'Stingless bees', 'sugarcane', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'Toxicity', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179490252&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2023.140878&partnerID=40&md5=5db0af7fb9c0a473f6a2c8a24f7cd314,Scopus,,0,residues,0,370

Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to field realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others.

Studies showed a potential link between altered expression of energy metabolism related transcripts and increased homing flight time of foragers exposed to pesticides. In this study, we investigated the effects of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin on longevity, flight behavior, and expression of transcripts involved in endocrine regulation (hbg-3, buffy, vitellogenin) and energy metabolism (cox5a, cox5b, cox17) using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Parallel, a laboratory study was conducted investigating whether pesticide exposure alone without the influence of flight activity caused similar expression patterns as in the RFID experiment. No significant effect on survival, homing flight duration, or return rate of exposed bees was detected. The overall time foragers spent outside the hive was significantly reduced post-exposure. Irrespective of the treatment group, a correlation was observed between cox5a, cox5b, cox17 and hbg-3 expression and prolonged homing flight duration. Our results suggest that flight behavior can impact gene expression and exposure to pesticides adversely affects the expression of genes that are important for maintaining optimal flight capacity. Our laboratory-based experiment showed significantly altered expression levels of cox5a, cox6c, and cox17.

Imidacloprid (IMP) is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture for pest management control. In this study, we investigate the influence of seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on the diet behavior of bees fed ad libitum two concentrations of IMP. We performed three independent two-choice feeding experiments using summer bees either emerged in the laboratory or in-hive and winter bees. Diet behavior post-ingestive aversion responses to IMP were investigated as well as potential affinity to the physical location and contents of the diets. Caged bees were challenged with a physical rotation of the diet‚Äôs location and their susceptibility to 5 and 20 PPB of IMP was tested. From a behavioral standpoint, our results show that winter bees expressed no affinity to the physical location of the diet but rather to its content and strongly favored IMP-tainted syrup at both 5 and 20 PPB. The opposite was recorded for na√Øve summer bees that emerged in the laboratory, which avoided the tainted syrup at both concentrations, particularly at 20 PPB. Summer bees emerged in-hive, expected to have developed a mature intestinal microbiota through trophallaxis from older bee-mates, were mainly neutral, and showed no affinity to the diet location nor its contents. Our results indicate that the physiological changes associated with seasonal phenotype and initial exposure to older mates have important consequences on the bee diet behavior toward pesticides. ¬© 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00922-9,53.0,1,,,,,"['Apis mellifera', 'concentration (composition)', 'diet', 'Diet behavior', 'Honey bee phenotypes', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid toxicity', 'laboratory method', 'phenotype', 'physiological response', 'seasonal variation']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126201521&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-022-00922-9&partnerID=40&md5=619f04c0658dc8fd00af94b0f78457a0,Scopus,,0,,0,375

Therefore, the goal of this study was to verify the influence of polyphenols on longevity, food consumption, and cytochrome P450 gene expression in worker bees intoxicated by thiacloprid. The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

However, the impacts of parasitic Nosema ceranae to host fitness during long-term pesticide exposure-induced stress is largely unknown. In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to a sublethal dose of dinotefuran, in the presence or absence of N. ceranae, was examined in terms of survival, food consumption, detoxification enzyme activities and gut microbial community. The interaction between dinotefuran and Nosema ceranae on the survival of honey bee was synergistic. Co-exposure to dinotefuran and N. ceranae led to less food consumption and greater changes of enzyme activities involved in defenses against oxidative stress. Particularly, N. ceranae and dinotefuran-N. ceranae co-exposure significantly impacted the gut microbiota structure and richness in adult honey bees, while dinotefuran alone did not show significant alternation of core gut microbiota compared to the control group. We herein demonstrated that chronical exposure to dinotefuran decreases honey bee's survival but is not steadily associated with the gut microbiota dysbiosis; by contrast, N. ceranae parasitism plays a dominant role in the combination in influencing the gut microbial community of the host honey bee. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of combinatorial effects between biotic and abiotic stressors on one of the most important pollinators, honey bees. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105808,200.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'dinotefuran', 'Dinotefuran', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'Gut microbiota', 'intestine flora', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Nosema', 'Nosema ceranae']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184571066&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2024.105808&partnerID=40&md5=6fed0eb899a740e69912d6b07b347777,Scopus,,0,,0,377

[Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature.

We therefore used the western honeybee Apis mellifera as a model to test the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin on the movement, biosensory abilities and odor-dependent conditioning of insects, titrating from lethal to sub-lethal doses. Bees treated with sub-lethal doses showed no significant movement impairment compared to untreated control bees, but their ability to react to an aversive stimulus was inhibited.

This study assessed the impact of four pesticides (Emamectin benzoate, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid) on honey bee eggs, larvae, and adult bees under controlled laboratory conditions. The pesticides were applied at concentrations of 10%, 30%, and 50%, as per regional agricultural recommendations. A zero-toxicity control was also included for comparison. Toxicity evaluations were conducted through contact exposure, and Probit and regression analyses were performed using SPSS software to comprehensively assess the toxicity profiles. The study revealed significant adverse effects on the immediate behavioral responses of A. mellifera following pesticide exposure. These effects included heightened agitation, narcotic-like symptoms, audible hovering, crawling, ceased food-sharing behavior, and reduced proboscis extension. Chlorpyrifos exhibited the highest toxicity against adult bees, while Emamectin Benzoate had the least toxicity. Regarding honey bee eggs, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid were notably more toxic, whereas Emamectin Benzoate exhibited the least toxicity. The impact on larvae varied across developmental stages and pesticides, with Imidacloprid, Chlorpyrifos, and Acetamiprid causing significant mortality, while Emamectin Benzoate showed lower toxicity. The study highlights that Emamectin Benzoate demonstrates lower toxicity compared to other insecticides. This emphasizes the importance of balancing effective pest management with the preservation of pollinator health. The findings underscore the need for informed and sustainable approaches to pesticide use, taking into consideration the potential repercussions on honeybee development and behavior. ¬© Iqbal, et al.",2024///,2024,10.3897/ejfa.2024.122884,2024.0,36,,,,,"['apiculture', 'biological development', 'honeybee health', 'Insecticides', 'pesticide exposure']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196789830&doi=10.3897%2fejfa.2024.122884&partnerID=40&md5=c74b64ea0385de562bae3fba000785b3,Scopus,,0,,0,381

We found that whereas neonicotinoid exposure weakly affected transcriptional responses of antimicrobial genes, it did not detectably affect the physiological antimicrobial response as measured by a lytic clearance assay of haemolymph.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (LC50/100: 0.014651 ng imidacloprid mu L-1 diet) on the distribution of certain proteins identified in the brain of Apis mellifera worker bees using a MALDI-imaging approach. This technique enables proteomic analysis of tissues in situ by monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biochemical processes occurring at a specific time in specific brain neuropils. For this purpose, foraging bees were exposed to an 8-day diet containing a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid corresponding to the LC50/100. Bees were collected on day 8 of exposure, and their brains analyzed using protein density maps. RESULTS The results showed that exposure to imidacloprid led to a series of biochemical changes, including alterations in synapse regulation, apoptosis regulation and oxidative stress, which may adversely impair the physiology of these colony bees. CONCLUSION Worker bee contact with even tiny amounts of imidacloprid had potent effects leading to the overexpression of a series of proteins related to important cellular processes that were possibly damaged by the insecticide.

How both factors affect gene expression and honey bee survival are well studied. However, only a few studies dealt with the interactions of the two factors. Here we studied the effects of both, when alone and in combination, on honey bee survival and expression changes of immune and detoxification genes. Newly emerged bees were randomly assigned four different treatments: control bees, bees exposed to thiamethoxam, bees exposed to thiamethoxam and then infected with Nosema, and bees infected with N.ceranae only. When combined with Nosema, thiamethoxam caused a significant reduction in survival from the control, but this reduction is not significantly different from N. ceranae alone. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused significantly increased expressions compared to the control for the genes of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptacin, but significantly decreased expression for the defensin gene. When the two factors were combined, the expression patterns were similar to N.ceranae infection alone (apidaecin, defencin and hymenoptaecin), except abaecin, which was increased compared to Nosema infected bees. For detoxification genesCCE8 and CYP315A1, thiamethoxam caused significantly increased gene expression but Nosema caused significantly decreased expression. When combined, the two factors did not show a further increase in Mortality compared to Nosema infection alone. Our study shows a clear combined effect of thiamethoxam and Nosema, but mainly in worker mortality and very little effect on gene expression.

556,888,JOUR,Molecular Effects of Neonicotinoids in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Mittner, F.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

Among them, exposure to neonicotinoids has been getting more attention and has been considered as a main stressor. The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Chinese indigenous honey bee (Apis cerana F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are two managed honey bee species in China. These two species are widely used in beekeeping, and many wild A. cerana is widely spread in forests and contributes to the ecosystem. It is predicated that A. cerana is more sensitive to insecticides than A. mellifera due to their smaller mass. Here, we found that although the body mass of A. cerana is significantly lower than A. mellifera, the sensitivity of the two species to neonicotinoids are not associated with their body mass but depended on the chemical structure of neonicotinoids. To dinotefuran, the two species showed the similar sensitivity. To acetamiprid, A. mellifera was less sensitive than A. cerana. However, to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, A. mellifera was more sensitive than A. cerana. These results suggested that the sensitivity of honey bees to neonicotinoids is closely associated with the structure of pesticides, but not with body mass of bees. It is also indicated that the hazards of pesticides to the different pollinators could not be inferred from one species to another. ¬© 2017 The Author(s) 2017.

In contrast to single applications of plant protection products (PPP), the effects of tank mixtures of two or more PPP on honey bees are not routinely assessed in the risk assessment of plant protection products. However, tank mixes are often common practice by farmers. Mixtures of practically non-toxic substances can lead to synergistic increase of toxic effects on honey bees, observed for the first time in 19921 in combinations of pyrethroids and azole fungicides. 2004 Iwasa et al. already reported that ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides strongly increase the toxicity of neonicotinoids in laboratory for the contact exposure route. Furthermore, in agricultural practice additives, adjuvants and fertilizers may be added to the spray solution. For these additives usually no informations on potential side effects on bees are available when mixed with plant protection products. Therefore, it is considered necessary to investigate possible additive or synergistic impacts and evaluate potentially critical combinations to ensure protection of bees. Here, we investigated the effects on bees of combinations of insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers under controlled laboratory conditions. A spray chamber was used to evaluate effects following contact exposure by typical field application rates. Subsequently, mortality and behaviour of bees were monitored for at least 48 h following the OECD acute contact toxicity test 2143.

Recently, we found that bees in a two-choice assay prefer to consume solutions containing field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiamethoxam (TMX), to sucrose alone. This suggests that neonicotinoids enhance the rewarding properties of sucrose and that low, acute doses could improve learning and memory in bees. To test this, we trained foraging-age honeybees to learn to associate floral scent with a reward containing nectar-relevant concentrations of IMD and TMX and tested their short (STM) and long-term (LTM) olfactory memories. Contrary to our predictions, we found that none of the solutions enhanced the rate of olfactory learning and some of them impaired it. In particular, the effect of 10 nM IMD was observed by the second conditioning trial and persisted 24 h later. In most other groups, exposure to IMD and TMX affected STM but not LTM. Our data show that negative impacts of low doses of IMD and TMX do not require long-term exposure and suggest that impacts of neonicotinoids on olfaction are greater than their effects on rewarding memories.",2015/10/19/,2015,10.1038/srep15322,5.0,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000362988900001,,,,,,,0,,0,388

We report here on a new bioassay that uses primary cultures of neurons derived from adult bumblebee workers to evaluate possible side-effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid. Mushroom bodies (MBs) from the brains of bumblebee workers were dissected and dissociated to produce cultures of Kenyon cells (KCs). Cultured KCs typically extend branched, dendrite-like processes called neurites, with substantial growth evident 24-48 h after culture initiation. Exposure of cultured KCs obtained from newly eclosed adult workers to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) imidacloprid, an environmentally relevant concentration of pesticide, did not have a detectable effect on neurite outgrowth. By contrast, in cultures prepared from newly eclosed adult bumblebees, inhibitory effects of imidacloprid were evident when the medium contained 25 ppb imidacloprid, and no growth was observed at 2,500 ppb. The KCs of older workers (13-day-old nurses and foragers) appeared to be more sensitive to imidacloprid than newly eclosed adults, as strong effects on KCs obtained from older nurses and foragers were also evident at 2.5 ppb imidacloprid.

197,154,JOUR,Toxic temperatures: Bee behaviours exhibit divergent pesticide toxicity relationships with warming,"['Kenna, D', 'Graystock, P', 'Gill, RJ']",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Climate change and agricultural intensification are exposing insect pollinators to temperature extremes and increasing pesticide usage. Yet, we lack good quantification of how temperature modulates the sublethal effects of pesticides on behaviours vital for fitness and pollination performance. Consequently, we are uncertain if warming decreases or increases the severity of different pesticide impacts, and whether separate behaviours vary in the direction of response. Quantifying these interactive effects is vital in forecasting pesticide risk across climate regions and informing pesticide application strategies and pollinator conservation. This multi-stressor study investigated the responses of six functional behaviours of bumblebees when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) or a sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) across a standardised low, mid, and high temperature. We found the neonicotinoid had a significant effect on five of the six behaviours, with a greater effect at the lower temperature(s) when measuring responsiveness, the likelihood of movement, walking rate, and food consumption rate. In contrast, the neonicotinoid had a greater impact on flight distance at the higher temperature. Our findings show that different organismal functions can exhibit divergent thermal responses, with some pesticide-affected behaviours showing greater impact as temperatures dropped, and others as temperatures rose. We must therefore account for environmental context when determining pesticide risk. Moreover, we found evidence of synergistic effects, with just a 3 degrees C increase causing a sudden drop in flight performance, despite seeing no effect of pesticide at the two lower temperatures.

Bumblebees learned to invert inside a narrow tube and lift a petal-shaped barrier to reach a reward chamber.

They play a significant role as pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops and produce economical products, such as honey, royal jelly, wax, pollen, propolis, and venom. Despite their ecological and economical importance, the global honey bee population is in decline due to factors including pathogens, parasites, intensive agriculture, and pesticides. Moreover, these factors may be interlinked and exacerbate the loss of honey bees. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between a pesticide, thiamethoxam, and deformed wing virus type A (DWV-A) to honey bees and the effects on survival rate, wing characteristics, and expression of immune and apoptosis genes in Apis mellifera. We described the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A on honey bee wing characteristics, DWV-A loads, and the expressions of immune (defensin, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin) and apoptosis genes (buffy, apaf1, caspase3-like, caspase8-like, and caspase9-like). Honey bee larvae were fed with three different thiamethoxam doses (0.001, 1.4, and 14.3 ng/¬µL of the diet). Then, thiamethoxam-treated white-eyed pupae were injected with 107 copy numbers/honey bee of the DWV-A genome. The interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A caused a high mortality rate, crippled wings in newly emerged adult honey bees (100%), and resulted in induced expression of hymenoptaecin gene compared to the control group, while downregulation of caspase8-like, caspase9-like genes compared to the DWV injection group. Therefore, the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A might have a deleterious effect on honey bee lifespan.

105,337,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/food‚Äìoral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not host‚Äìpathogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey bees‚Äô innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. ¬© 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15.0,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,,,0,,0,394

Clothianidin, V. destructor and their combination differentially affected the expression of the neural-related genes, AmNrx-1 (neurexin), AmNlg-1 (neuroligin), and AmAChE-2 (acetylcholinesterase). Different doses of clothianidin down-regulated or up-regulated the genes, whereas V. destructor tended to have a down-regulatory effect. It appears that clothianidin and V. destructor affected neural processes in honey bees through different mechanisms. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

250,511,JOUR,A novel laboratory method for simulating pollinator exposure to agrochemical-laden particulate matter,"['Green, F.B.', 'Peterson, E.M.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Ecotoxicology,"Environmental transport and deposition of particulate matter (PM) associated with toxic chemicals has begun to receive attention as a source of risk to pollinators. For example, dust arising from manipulations of insecticide-treated seed has potential to exert toxic effects among non-target insects. Similarly, synthetic steroid growth promoters, antibiotics and multiple insecticides and parasiticides detected in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM may also negatively impact pollinators since many of these chemicals have been detected on wildflowers and pollinators collected near beef cattle feedyards. Therefore, there is a need to assess risk to pollinators posed by deposition of agrochemical-laden PM, both in the field and the laboratory. Unfortunately, established laboratory methods for simulating PM exposure or toxicity associated with contaminated PM are few and highly situation-specific. Herein we describe development and use of a PM circulation system that can be employed to evaluate toxicity of agrochemical-contaminated PM in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Two model organisms (honeybees (Apis mellifera) and mason bees (Osmia lignaria)) were exposed to agrochemical-free PM in the circulator system, and post-exposure mortality was compared with controls. No significant differences in mortality between exposed and control bees were observed. Next, honeybees and mason bees were exposed to PM spiked with an insecticide known to exert toxic effects to pollinators (thiamethoxam). Bees experienced significantly higher mortality when exposed to thiamethoxam-laden PM at environmentally relevant concentrations as compared to bees exposed to agrochemical-free PM. These results confirm the validity of these methods for use in controlled laboratory PM toxicity tests and offer a source of positive and negative control groups for laboratory and field experiments examining exposure of pollinators to potentially toxic agrochemical-laden PM. This method facilitates generation of more realistic toxicity data than standard contact toxicity tests when pollinator exposure scenarios involve particulate-based agrochemicals or other toxic chemicals. ¬© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02660-9,32.0,4,544,551,,,"['agricultural chemical', 'agrochemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bovine', 'Cattle', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'female', 'health impact assessment', 'Honeybees', 'insect', 'Insecta', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Mason bees', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'particulate matter', 'Particulate matter', 'Particulate Matter', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'risk assessment', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'toxic material', 'toxicity test', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity testing methods']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159114441&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-023-02660-9&partnerID=40&md5=52816e6741feb52e552357e5ad7304f9,Scopus,,0,,0,397

238,539,JOUR,Drone honey bees are disproportionately sensitive to abiotic stressors despite expressing high levels of stress response proteins,"['McAfee, A.', 'Metz, B.N.', 'Milone, J.P.', 'Foster, L.J.', 'Tarpy, D.R.']",Communications Biology,"Drone honey bees (Apis mellifera) are the obligate sexual partners of queens, and the availability of healthy, high-quality drones directly affects a queen‚Äôs fertility and productivity. Yet, our understanding of how stressors affect adult drone fertility, survival, and physiology is presently limited. Here, we investigated sex biases in susceptibility to abiotic stressors (cold stress, topical imidacloprid exposure, and topical exposure to a realistic cocktail of pesticides). We found that drones (haploid males) were more sensitive to cold and imidacloprid exposure than workers (sterile, diploid females), but the cocktail was not toxic at the concentrations tested. We corroborated this lack of cocktail toxicity with in-hive exposures via pollen feeding. We then used quantitative proteomics to investigate protein expression profiles in the hemolymph of topically exposed workers and drones, and found that 34 proteins were differentially expressed in exposed drones relative to controls, but none were differentially expressed in exposed workers. Contrary to our hypothesis, we show that drones express surprisingly high baseline levels of putative stress response proteins relative to workers. This suggests that drones‚Äô stress tolerance systems are fundamentally rewired relative to workers, and susceptibility to stress depends on more than simply gene dose or allelic diversity. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1038/s42003-022-03092-7,5.0,1,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'cold', 'Cold Temperature', 'drug effect', 'female', 'Female', 'gene expression regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'imidacloprid', 'male', 'Male', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiological stress', 'physiology', 'sex factor', 'Sex Factors', 'Stress, Physiological']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124776154&doi=10.1038%2fs42003-022-03092-7&partnerID=40&md5=614a421a5156584ebdb4e8019b3529ca,Scopus,,0,,0,399

Comparing its acute contact sensitivity to Apis mellifera,"['Uhl, P', 'Awanbor, O', 'Schulz, RS', 'Br√ºhl, CA']",PLOS ONE,"Bees provide essential ecosystem services and help maintain floral biodiversity. However, there is an ongoing decline of wild and domesticated bee species. Since agricultural pesticide use is a key driver of this process, there is a need for a protective risk assessment. To achieve a more protective registration process, two bee species, Osmia bicornis/Osmia cornuta and Bombus terrestris, were proposed by the European Food Safety Authority as additional test surrogates to the honey bee Apis mellifera. We investigated the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of multiple commercial insecticide formulations towards the red mason bee (O. bicornis) and compared these values to honey bee regulatory endpoints. In two thirds of all cases, O. bicornis was less sensitive than the honey bee. By applying an assessment factor of 10 on the honey bee endpoint, a protective level was achieved for 87% (13 out 15) of all evaluated products. Our results show that O. bicornis is rarely an adequate additional surrogate species for lower tier risk assessment since it is less sensitive than the honey bee for the majority of investigated products. Given the currently limited database on bee species sensitivity, the honey bee seems sufficiently protective in acute scenarios as long as a reasonable assessment factor is applied.

Accumulating evidence suggests that these effects extend to the honeybee gut microbiome, which serves important functions for honeybee health. Here we test the potential effects of the pesticides thiacloprid, acetamiprid, and oxalic acid on the gut microbiota of honeybees, first in direct in vitro inhibition assays and secondly in an in vivo caged bee experiment to test if exposure leads to gut microbiota community changes. We found that thiacloprid did not inhibit the honeybee core gut bacteria in vitro, nor did it affect overall community composition or richness in vivo. Acetamiprid did also not inhibit bacterial growth in vitro, but it did affect community structure within bees. The eight bacterial genera tested showed variable levels of susceptibility to oxalic acid in vitro. In vivo, treatment with this pesticide reduced amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and affected gut microbiome composition, with most marked impact on the common crop bacteria Lactobacillus kunkeei and the genus Bombella. We conducted network analyses which captured known associations between bacterial members and illustrated the sensitivity of the microbiome to environmental stressors. Our findings point to risks of honeybee exposure to oxalic acid, which has been deemed safe for use in treatment against Varroa mites in honeybee colonies, and we advocate for more extensive assessment of the long-term effects that it may have on honeybee health. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2021 Cuesta-Mat√©, Renelies-Hamilton, Kryger, Jensen, Sinotte and Poulsen.",2021///,2021,10.3389/fmicb.2021.717990,12.0,,,,,,"['acaricide', 'acetamiprid', 'amplicon', 'anthropogenic stressor', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic sensitivity', 'Article', 'Bartonella', 'Bifidobacterium', 'controlled study', 'DNA extraction', 'honeybee', 'in vitro study', 'in vivo study', 'insect society', 'intestine flora', 'Lactobacillus', 'microbial community', 'microbial diversity', 'microbiome', 'minimum inhibitory concentration', 'neonicotinoid', 'nonhuman', 'oxalic acid', 'pesticide', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'RNA 16S', 'social insect', 'symbiosis', 'thiacloprid']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115175472&doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2021.717990&partnerID=40&md5=fde26e390f69af1f4807fc473a7eadca,Scopus,,0,,0,401

We carried out three independent experiments to study the impact of acute oral treatment of 20 ŒºL TMX at concentrations of 2.4 ppb (0.048 ng/bee) and 10¬†ppb (0.2¬†ng/bee) on the homing, flight, learning acquisition and short-term retention ability of A. cerana. The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results: When treated with 10¬†ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4¬†ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability. Bees treated with either 2.4¬†ppb or 10¬†ppb TMX had significantly lower learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Conclusion: Results suggest that acute oral exposure to 10¬†ppb of TMX altered the short-distance homing time, flight ability, and learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Our study also highlights the concern that acute oral exposure to a low concentration of 2.4¬†ppb could have consequences on the behavior of A. creana.

The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline. ¬© 2022",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161331,868.0,,,,,,"['Ammonia', 'ammonium', 'animal', 'animal health', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bioaccumulation', 'controlled study', 'crop protection', 'down regulation', 'gene expression', 'Glucose', 'glucose oxidase', 'Glucose oxidase', 'Glucose sensors', 'glufosinate', 'Glufosinate', 'Glufosinate-ammonium', 'glyphosate', 'Gut bacteria', 'Gut microbiota', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'immunocompetence', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'intestine flora', 'lifespan', 'long term exposure', 'lysozyme', 'Molecules', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nitrogen', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'Non-target organism', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'phosphinothricin', 'protein expression', 'risk assessment', 'short term exposure', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'survival', 'unclassified drug', 'Weed control']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146540349&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.161331&partnerID=40&md5=a03515a9e14c5ba0807878b92627c4fd,Scopus,,0,,0,405

The toxicity of several pesticides to O. lignaria and other Osmia species has been previously reported. However, the field-realistic toxicity of formulated premix insecticides comprised of multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to O. lignaria has not been assessed. Here, we use a customized spray tower in a laboratory setting to assess adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to four formulated pesticide mixtures: thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin (TLC), imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin (IBC), chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (CLC) and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram (MS) by directly spraying anesthetized bees in Petri dishes. Sepa-rately, adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to formulated imidacloprid (I), beta-cyfluthrin (BC) and their 1:1 binary combination (IBC) was assessed using the same experimental method. Resulting mortality in each study was screened up to 96 h post-treatment to determine acute whole-body contact toxicity. In the first study, TLC and IBC resulted in statistically higher mortality at 24 and 48 h than the two other insecticide combinations tested. The CLC and MS combinations were slower acting and the highest mortality for O. lignaria exposed to these mixtures was recorded at 96 h. We did observe significant differences in toxicity between CLC and MS. In the second study, exposure to the 1:1 binary combination of IBC caused overall significantly higher mortality than exposure to I or BC alone. Both active ingredients alone, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of mortality to the 1:1 binary combination treatment at the 96 h observation reading, indicating increased speed of kill, but not necessarily increased toxicity.

Interestingly, increased mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected bees after exposure to boscalid, with synergistic negative effects. Regarding gut microbiota composition, co-exposure to the parasite and each pesticide led to decreased abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, and increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria.

However, pesticide application is still recognized as one of the main stress factors causing a decline in the global population of bees. In all ERA procedures, the effects of pesticides on the honey bee species Apis mellifera are used as a reference for the effects on all different bee species. To evaluate if tropical native bees are protected by the current risk assessment procedures and to propose improvements to the methods, we assessed the ecological risk of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid posed to native and exotic bee species. The risk was assessed through a low (TIER I) and an intermediate (TIER II) level of analysis. For TIER I the USEPA BeeREX model was used and for TIER II the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach was adopted. For the imidacloprid exposure conditions, four different crops were taken into consideration; bean, passion fruit, sunflower and tomato. The imidacloprid risk on native species was assessed both by extrapolating the effects obtained to Apis species, and by using ecotoxicological data from tests performed with native species. In TIER I, the risks calculated through empirical data showed that more than 50% of the non-Apis species presented risk levels of 28‚Äì180% higher than those obtained with the extrapolation factor used in the Brazilian pesticide regulation. In TIER II, the SSDs showed that most of the native bees are more sensitive to imidacloprid than the Africanized A. mellifera. This is the first study in which an ERA of a pesticide was conducted on tropical bee species.

As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling in insects, leading to neurotoxicity and are therefore globally used as insecticides. Several behavioral studies have shown links between neonicotinoid exposure of bees and adverse effects on foraging activity, homing flight performance and reproduction, but the molecular aspects underlying these effects are not well-understood. In the last years, several studies through us and others showed the effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on gene expression in the brain of honey bees. Transcripts of acetylcholine receptors, hormonal regulation, stress markers, detoxification enzymes, immune system related genes and transcripts of the energy metabolism were altered after neonicotinoid exposure. To elucidate the link between homing flight performance and shifts in gene expression in the brain of honey bees after neonicotinoid exposure, we combined homing flight activity experiments applying RFID technology and gene expression analysis. We analyzed the expression of endocrine factors, stress genes, detoxification enzymes and genes linked to energy metabolism in forager bees after homing flight experiments. Three different experiments (experiment I: pilot study; experiment II: ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù study and experiment III: laboratory study) were performed. In a pilot study, we wanted to investigate if we could see differences in gene expression between controls and exposed bees (experiment I). This first study was followed by a so-called ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù study (experiment II), where we investigated mainly differences in the expression of transcripts linked to energy metabolism between fast and slow returning foragers. We found a correlation between homing flight duration and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, one transcript linked to oxidative phosphorylation. In the third experiment (experiment III), foragers were exposed in the laboratory to 1 ng/bee thiamethoxam and 8 ng/bee thiacloprid followed by gene expression analysis without a subsequent flight experiment. We could partially confirm the induction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, which we detected in experiment II. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the feeding mode (group feeding vs. single bee feeding) on data scattering and demonstrated that single bee feeding is superior to group feeding as it significantly reduces variability in gene expression. Based on the data, we thus hypothesize that the disruption of energy metabolism may be one reason for a prolongation of homing flight duration in neonicotinoid treated bees.

69,638,JOUR,Measuring foraging preferences in bumble bees: a comparison of popular laboratory methods and a test for sucrose preferences following neonicotinoid exposure,"['Richman, S.K.', 'Muth, F.', 'Leonard, A.S.']",Oecologia,"Animals develop food preferences based on taste, nutritional quality and to avoid environmental toxins. Yet, measuring preferences in an experimental setting can be challenging since ecologically realistic assays can be time consuming, while simplified assays may not capture natural sampling behavior. Field realism is a particular challenge when studying behavioral responses to environmental toxins in lab-based assays, given that toxins can themselves impact sampling behavior, masking our ability to detect preferences. We address these challenges by comparing different experimental methods for measuring sucrose concentration preference in bumble bees (Bombus impatiens), evaluating the utility of two preference chamber-based methods (ad libitum versus a novel restricted-sampling assay) in replicating bees‚Äô preferences when they fly freely between artificial flowers in a foraging arena. We find that the restricted-sampling method matched a free-flying scenario more closely than the ad libitum protocol, and we advocate for expanded use of this approach, given its ease of implementation. We then performed a second experiment using the new protocol to ask whether consuming the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid, known to suppress feeding motivation, interfered with the expression of sucrose preferences. After consuming imidacloprid, bees were less likely to choose the higher-quality sucrose even as they gained experience with both options. Thus, we provide evidence that pesticides interfere with bees‚Äô ability to discriminate between floral rewards that differ in value. This work highlights a simple protocol for assessing realistic foraging preferences in bees and provides an efficient way for researchers to measure the impacts of anthropogenic factors on preference expression. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2021///,2021,10.1007/s00442-021-04979-8,196.0,4,963,976,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavioral assays', 'Bombus (genus)', 'Bombus impatiens', 'comparative study', 'detection method', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Laboratories', 'laboratory', 'laboratory method', 'Nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollution exposure', 'Preference', 'preference behavior', 'sucrose', 'Sucrose', 'testing method']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110399880&doi=10.1007%2fs00442-021-04979-8&partnerID=40&md5=015fffd77d9d13f13cc7376a6366720f,Scopus,,0,,0,413
527,606,JOUR,Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees,"['Tsvetkov, N.', 'Zayed, A.']",Ecology and Evolution,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a ‚Äústreetlight effect‚Äù where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways; foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 ¬µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. ¬© 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118699937&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100051&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0e1bc03406e457bd1eb4d83cd26b7,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'Associative learning', 'Clothianidin', 'EMF', 'Flight']",,,,0,,0,415

(bumble bees), play important roles in the environment as pollinators, and they are directly affected by agronomical practices, such as pesticide spraying or the selection of crop cultivar. Sunflower is an important resource for these pollinators, and its yield is highly dependent on pollination. Six sunflower hybrid cultivars (ES Biba, Gonzalo, Drake, Vellox, NK Neoma, and P63LE10) were used to compare the visitation rates (VR) of pollinators during flowering in three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). From this set, cultivar P63LE10 was selected to evaluate how pesticide treatments (mixture of two insecticide products containing acetamiprid and pirimicarb, respectively, and two fungicide products containing propiconazole plus prochloraz and dimoxystrobin plus boscalid, respectively) affect pollinator visitation. The amount of pesticide residue in sunflower inflorescences was analyzed to determine the content over the duration of the experiments. The sunflower cultivar P63LE10 was significantly the most attractive to both groups of pollinators in 2017. This cultivar was visited by the highest number of honey bees also in the other years. For bumble bees, cultivar P63LE10, along with cultivars NK Neoma and Vellox, had the highest visitation rates in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, plants treated by the fungicide dimoxystrobin plus boscalid had the highest visitation rates for both groups of pollinators. For bumble bees plants treated with this fungicide were significantly more visited (VR 23.1 ¬± 2.1%) than these treated with insecticide with pirimicarb (16.4 ¬± 2%) and the untreated control (17.9 ¬± 1.7%), and for honey bees plants treated with dimoxystrobin plus boscalid were significantly more visited (VR 24 ¬± 4.5%) than all other treatments except with acetamiprid (20.5 ¬± 3.5%). The residues of tested pesticides were found in blooms for the whole time of the experiment (range of values for 2016 and 2017 [ng/g]: acetamiprid 144‚Äì6, 3360‚Äì56; pirimicarb 177‚Äì12, 223‚Äì10; prochloraz 380‚Äì6, 1970‚Äì912; propiconazole 324‚Äì17, 1024‚Äì1018; boscalid 216‚Äì154, 9600‚Äì1319; dimoxystrobin 452‚Äì137, 6560‚Äì911).

Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus, TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and, potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain outdoors. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15308-6,7.0,1,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033712581&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-017-15308-6&partnerID=40&md5=3f5ad3c593852af728b730e1444a9003,Scopus,,0,,0,420

Cry1Ab did not affect mortality, syrup consumption or learning capacities. However, foraging activity was reduced during and after the treatment. Deltamethrin and imidacloprid both affected syrup consumption and foraging activity. Deltamethrin also induced a reduction in learning capacities.

They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that regulation of honey bee P450s is tuned to chemicals occurring naturally in the hive environment and that, in terms of toxicological capacity, a diet of sugar is not equivalent to a diet of honey.",2012/02/03/,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0031051,7.0,2,,,1932-6203,WOS:000302178400026,,,,,,,0,,0,422

The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with LD50 values of 18ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22ng for clothianidin, 30ng for thiamethoxam, 75ng for dinotefuran and 138ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with LD50 values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6Œºg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50Œºg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees. When honey bees were placed in cages in forced contact with alfalfa treated with acetamiprid and the synergist, triflumizole, in combination at their maximum recommended application rates, no mortality was detected above that of the control. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

241,967,JOUR,Cytotoxic effects of thiamethoxam in the midgut and malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae),"['Catae, A.F.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'De Oliveira, R.A.', 'Ferreira Nocelli, R.C.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Microscopy Research and Technique,"Due to its expansion, agriculture has become increasingly dependent on the use of pesticides. However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/jemt.22339,77.0,4,274,281,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896317005&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22339&partnerID=40&md5=52d578be248c256349e4f0308aa95ff2,Scopus,,0,,0,424

In contrast to applications of single PPPs the effects of tank mixtures are not routinely evaluated in the risk assessment process of PPPs with the exception of known synergistic insecticides and mixing partners. Due to economi-cal constraints and process efficiency PPP mixtures are commonly used in agricultural practices. However, some-times interactions among agrochemicals lead to undesir-able additive and synergistic effects. Especially mixtures of pyrethroids or neonicotinoids with azole fungicides, which inhibit sterol biosynthesis, have a synergistic potential of negatively affecting honey bees. For such mixtures, regulatory restrictions are already in place. These synergistic effects are associated with azole fungicides inhibiting the main detoxification enzyme P450, which hinders the bee to detoxify the insecticide. Further studies provide first evidence for increased impacts of mixtures of insecticides with adjuvants on honey bees. More research is necessary to better understand mixture toxicity and to implement this knowledge in the risk assessment. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.",2020///,2020,10.5073/JfK.2020.05.05,72.0,5,154,161,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084201388&doi=10.5073%2fJfK.2020.05.05&partnerID=40&md5=1f3c674c0b47889636e0e7b64efcb845,Scopus,Auswirkungen von pflanzenschutzmittel-tankmischungen auf honigbienen und m√∂gliche physiologische interaktionen,0,,0,425

However, they have been found to negatively affect bees, especially Apis mellifera. Despite this, little research has been conducted on the impact of neonicotinoids on other bee species, including native ones. This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI). The Tetragona clavipes (bee native to Brazil) were exposed to eight concentrations of IMI-based insecticide, through contaminated food or mist (350 ¬µL/min) for 24¬†h. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, LC90-24¬†h in acute topical effect (ATE) and¬†acute residual effect (ARE)¬†of IMI-based insecticide against bees were calculated. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, and LC90-24¬†h in ARE were found to be more toxic compared to ATE. In summary, the study highlights that even low levels of IMI can significantly reduce bee survival within 24¬†h. The urgency to tackle the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on native bee populations is evident. Preserving bees is crucial for ensuring sustainability, food security, and ecosystem integrity.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006‚Äì0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003‚Äì0.0006) Œºg active ingredient (a.i.) bee‚àí1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata.

Despite many studies have revealed that the most important Chinese indigenous speciesÔºåApis cerana, is presenting a high risk on exposure to neonicotinoids, the toxicology information on Apis cerana remain limited. This study was aimed to determine the acute and chronic toxic effects of thiacloprid (IUPAC name: {(2Z)-3-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene}cyanamide) on behavioral and physiological performance as well as genome-wide transcriptome in A. cerana. We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana.

622,410,JOUR,Honeybee gut bacterial strain improved survival and gut microbiota homeostasis in Apis mellifera exposed in vivo to clothianidin,"['El Khoury, S.', 'Gauthier, J.', 'Mercier, P.L.', 'Mo√Øse, S.', 'Giovenazzo, P.', 'Derome, N.']",Microbiology spectrum,"Pesticides are causing honeybee mortality worldwide. Research carried out on honeybees indicates that application of pesticides has a significant impact on the core gut community, which ultimately leads to an increase in the growth of harmful pathogens. Disturbances caused by pesticides also affect the way bacterial members interact, which results in gut microbial dysbiosis. Administration of beneficial microbes has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating or preventing disease in honeybees. The objective of this study was to measure under in vivo conditions the ability of two bacterial strains (the Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea sp.) isolated from honeybee gut to improve survival and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in honeybees exposed to a sublethal clothianidin dose (0.1 ppb). Both gut bacterial strains were selected for their ability to degrade clothianidin in vitro regardless of their host-microbe interaction characteristics (e.g., beneficial, neutral, or harmful). To this end, we conducted cage trials on 4- to 6-day-old newly emerging honeybees. During microbial administration, we jointly monitored the taxonomic distribution and activity level of bacterial symbionts quantifying 16S rRNA transcripts. First, curative administration of the Pantoea sp. strain significantly improved the survival of clothianidin-exposed honeybees compared to sugar control bees (i.e., supplemented with sugar [1:1]).

517,34,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

However, the data on wild bee sensitivity to pesticides are scarce. As it may not be possible to stop using pesticides at the moment due to a growing food demand, we need to make every effort to ensure that they are used in a way that do not jeopardize pollinator populations. We tested the toxicity of three agrochemicals, namely Dursban 480 EC with chlorpyrifos as active ingredient (a.i.), Sherpa 100 EC (a.i. cypermethrin), and Mospilan 20 SP (a.i. acetamiprid), to female Osmia bicornis through oral and contact exposures. The estimated LC50 s at infinite-time were lower than concentrations recommended for field application for Dursban in both exposure routes, whereas in case of Sherpa and Mospilan the values were lower for oral exposure only. Regardless of the exposure route, high mortality in less than 24 hours was observed in Dursban-treated bees at a fraction of concentration actually used by farmers in the field, indicating high toxicity of this product to O. bicornis. Therefore, some commonly used insecticides may cause unacceptable effects to pollinators even when applied in the field according to recommendations, indicating the urgent need for revising current pesticide usage regulations. ¬© 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

304,649,JOUR,Pesticide risk assessment at the molecular level using honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes: A complementary approach,"['Haas, J.', 'Nauen, R.']",Environment International,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) first-tier pesticide risk assessment is largely based on standardized laboratory toxicity bioassays after both acute and chronic exposure. Recent research on honey bee cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) uncovered CYP9Q3 as the molecular determinant mediating neonicotinoid insecticide selectivity and explaining why certain neonicotinoids such as thiacloprid show > 1000-fold lower acute toxicity than others (e.g. imidacloprid). Here this knowledge is leveraged for mechanistic risk assessment at the molecular level using a fluorescence-based high-throughput in vitro assay, predicting the interaction of diverse pesticidal chemotypes, including azole fungicides, with recombinantly expressed honey bee CYP9Q enzymes, known to metabolize thiacloprid, acetamiprid and tau-fluvalinate. Some azole fungicides were shown to be synergistic in combination with certain insecticides, including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, whereas others such as prothioconazole were not. We demonstrate that biochemical CYP9Q2/CYP9Q3 inhibition data of azoles revealed a striking correlation with their synergistic potential at the organismal level, and even allow to explain combined toxicity effects observed for tank mixtures under field conditions. Our novel toxicogenomics-based approach is designed to complement existing methods for pesticide risk assessment with unprecedented screening capacity, by utilizing honey bee P450 enzymes known to confer pesticide selectivity, in order to biochemically address issues of ecotoxicological concern. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106372,147.0,,,,,,"['7 benzyloxy 4 trifluoromethyleoumarin', 'acetamiprid', 'acute toxicity', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'arylation', 'bee', 'Bees', 'binding site', 'Combined toxicity', 'controlled study', 'correlation analysis', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'cytochrome P450 9Q2', 'cytochrome P450 9Q3', 'Cytochrome p450 enzymes', 'Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'ecotoxicity', 'ecotoxicology', 'edetic acid', 'enzyme activity', 'enzyme binding', 'enzyme inhibition', 'Enzymes', 'epoxiconazole', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence analysis', 'fluvalinate', 'Food products', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'genetics', 'genomics', 'honeybee', 'IC50', 'imidacloprid', 'in vitro study', 'in vivo study', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge management', 'LD50', 'Michaelis Menten kinetics', 'molecular analysis', 'Molecular determinants', 'Molecular ecotoxicology', 'molecular size', 'mortality rate', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'physiological response', 'Pollinator safety', 'priority journal', 'process optimization', 'protein expression', 'pyrethroid', 'Recent researches', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Screening capacity', 'Synergism', 'thiacloprid', 'thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'Toxicogenomics', 'triadimefon', 'triazole derivative', 'triflumizole', 'unclassified drug', 'uniconazole']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099051848&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2020.106372&partnerID=40&md5=77dc0558ca8e230c990713233c55fa45,Scopus,,0,,0,435

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016/04//,2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109.0,2,0022-0493,WOS:000374497000004,515,519,,,,,,,0,,0,438
625,961,JOUR,Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees,"['Williamson, S.M.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes. ¬© 2013.

Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the impact of both stressors, singly and in combination, on honey bees of African descent that have demonstrated resistance to parasites and pesticides. Africanized honey bees (AHBs, Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier) were inoculated with N. ceranae (1 √ó 105 spores/bee) and/or chronically exposed for 18 days to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam (0.025 ng/bee) to evaluate their single and combined effects on food consumption, survivorship, N. ceranae infection, and immunity at the cellular and humoral levels. No significant effects by any of the stressors were found for food consumption. However, thiamethoxam was the main stressor associated to a significant decrease in AHB survivorship, whereas N. ceranae was the main stressor affecting their humoral immune response by upregulating the expression of the gene AmHym-1. Additionally, both stressors, separately and combined, significantly decreased the concentration of haemocytes in the haemolymph of the bees. These findings indicate that N. ceranae and thiamethoxam differentially affect the lifespan and immunity of AHBs and do not seem to have synergistic effects when AHBs are simultaneously exposed to both stressors. ¬© 2023 by the authors.",2023///,2023,10.3390/microorganisms11051258,11.0,5,,,,,"['Apis mellifera', 'cellular immunity', 'gene expression', 'haemocytes', 'humoral immunity', 'neonicotinoid insecticides', 'Nosema ceranae']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160758660&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms11051258&partnerID=40&md5=c25adb86e90ea97d6595e4b6933d44e6,Scopus,,0,,0,440

Imidacloprid is a chloronicotinyl insecticide, which has a highly specific affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the honeybee's nervous system. So it may interfere with dance behavior and memory formation. We found the waggle dances were modulated in honeybees fed sucrose water containing imidacloprid (pesticide group) compared to those fed normal sucrose water (control group). In our data, dancers of the pesticide group significantly increased the variance of divergence angle and the return phases in waggle dances than the control group. And the dance followers in pesticide group significantly increased the variance of crop content than the control group. Furthermore, four learning and memory related genes were significantly regulated at the gene expression levels between pesticide and control group. Our data revealed that the sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid impaired the honeybees‚Äô learning and memory and resulted in cognitive disorder. The dancers may adjust their recruitment behavior leading to the observed reduced number of followers.

RESULTS: We found a strong negative effect on microbial gut community composition when exposed to the bee pest control chemicals oxytetracycline, oxalic acid and imidacloprid, and when inoculated with the bee pest Nosema spp. and the potential bee pest biocontrol agent Lactobacillus plantarum. Results from the in vitro test with bee pest chemicals showed a differential response of Lactobacillus spp. At the community level, some taxonomic groups were more affected depending on treatment, but sharp changes in the microbial structure were caused by compounds generally considered as bee safe. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pests such as Nosema spp. and pest control methods alter the composition of bee gut microorganisms, which may have severe consequences for pathogen defense, physiology and general honey bee health.

There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions.

As both DMI fungicides and insecticides can be used near or during crop bloom, the combination may be hazardous if exposed to pollinators. Using pesticides used in blueberry or apple production, we conducted laboratory bioassays to test how combinations of field-relevant concentrations of DMI fungicides and insecticides affected honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival. We found propiconazole, a DMI fungicide, potentiated the toxicity of the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid. We found no evidence of propiconazole potentiating field-relevant concentrations of the spinosyn insecticide spinetoram. We also found that the DMI fungicide flusilazole potentiated spinetoram but not acetamiprid. A fungicidal formulation combining pyraclostrobin and boscalid did not potentiate either insecticide.

The nectar- and water-collecting, and climbing abilities of bees are crucial to the survival of the bees and the execution of responsibilities in bee colonies. Besides behavioral impact, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid, especially by the way of RNA-seq at the transcriptomic level, are limited. We treated Apis mellifera L. with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) and determined the effect on behaviors and the transcriptomic changes. The sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid had a limited impact on the survival and syrup consumption of bees, but caused a significant increase in water consumption. Moreover, the climbing ability was significantly impaired by 10 ppb imidacloprid at 8 d. In the RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment indicated a significant down-regulation of muscle-related genes, which might contribute to the impairment in climbing ability of bees. The enriched GO terms were attributed to the up-regulated ribosomal protein genes.

However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/ŒºL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen. GST activity showed differences in the abdomen after one and five days of thiamethoxam exposure. These findings suggests that the abdomen is more affected than the head after oral exposure to thiamethoxam. Our study provides evidence of the toxicity of thiamethoxam at both the cellular and organismal levels, reinforcing the need to include non-Apis species in pollinator risk assessments. and provide solid arguments for bee protection. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142853,363.0,,,,,,"['acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'acute toxicity', 'And acetylcholinesterase', 'And AChE', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'biochemical oxygen demand', 'biological marker', 'biomarker', 'Biomarker assessment', 'Biomarkers', 'Cae3', 'CaE3', 'carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylesterase', 'controlled study', 'drug effect', 'enzyme activity', 'Friesiomelitta varia', 'Glutathione S-transferases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'GST', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'physiology', 'pollution exposure', 'practice guideline', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'stingless bee', 'sublethal concentration', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'survival analysis', 'survival time', 'Survival time', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198568641&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.142853&partnerID=40&md5=9de40d691e254e0b9c40ceb789d2ef0f,Scopus,,0,,0,450

The European dark bee, Apis mellifera mellifera (L.) is widely used for crop pollination. However, pesticide usage in modern agriculture has threatened the plant-bee pollinator interaction. There is lack of data regarding lethal time, insecticide concentration and poisoning symptoms, especially for formulated insecticides that are widely used in insect management. This study shows that the intrinsic toxicity of insecticides (LC50) to A. mellifera mellifera (L.) was in the following order: imidacloprid (0.0070) > fipronil (0.0125) > indoxacarb (0.0266) > cypermethrin (0.0370) > dimethoate (0.0385). The lethal time (LT50) values (h) in the ascending order of toxicity of insecticides were as follows: fipronil (6.56), cypermethrin (6.69), dimethoate (8.00), imidacloprid (9.85) and indoxacarb (13.45). Distinct poisoning symptoms observed in A. mellifera mellifera were extended proboscis, expanded wings, unhooked wings, extended legs and twisted bodies, defecation on cage covers, sting in release-out position and anus with excreta. All the tested pesticides are harmful to the honey bee except azadirachtin. The tested pesticides exhibited different poisoning symptoms in bees, which could be useful for beekeepers in identifying the cause of colony mortality. In conclusion, the pesticide toxicological research on bees is an important safety aspect for beneficial organisms.

Phytochemicals, e.g., quercetin, have been demonstrated to increase the pesticide tolerance of Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), which is helpful to develop strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to pollinators. In this study, we hypothesized phytochemicals could reduce the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on Apis cerana Fabricius. The lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana workers were investigated. The results showed that A. cerana workers chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid had a significantly shorter longevity by 10.81 d compared with control. Acute exposure to imidacloprid at 100 Œºg/liter impaired the sucrose responsiveness and memory retention of the workers, and 20 Œºg/liter reduced the sucrose responsiveness. The treatment with 37.8 mg/liter quercetin for 24 h could increase the longevity of A. cerana workers when chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid, and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin feeding treatment alleviated the impairment of sucrose responsiveness. However, workers treated with 151.2 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin had a significantly shorter longevity compared to that of bees chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid without quercetin treatment. Our results suggested that quercetin treatment could produce a biphasic influence on the lethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana. Quercetin at 37.8 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter in the diet before pesticide exposure was able to reduce the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, respectively, providing potential strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to native honey bees (A. cerana).  ¬© 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria, producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed. Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure were withdrawn, survival was maintained. Bees and insects generally cannot see deep red light so it does not disturb their behaviour. Hence, we show that deep red light exposure that improves mitochondrial function, reverses the sensory and motor deficits induced by Imidacloprid. These results may have important implications as light delivery is economic and can be placed in hives/colonies.",2016/11/15/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0166531,11.0,11,1932-6203,WOS:000387794600077,,,,,,,,,0,,0,453

331,472,JOUR,Honey bee foraging ability suppressed by imidacloprid can be ameliorated by adding adenosine,"['Lin, Y.-C.', 'Lu, Y.-H.', 'Tang, C.-K.', 'Yang, E.-C.', 'Wu, Y.-L.']",Environmental Pollution,"Honey bees are important pollinators in most ecosystem, but they are currently facing many threats, which have led to a reduction in their population. Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid pesticide can impair the memory and learning ability of honey bees, which can eventually lead to a decline in their foraging and homing abilities. In this study, we investigated the homing ability barrier from the perspective of energy supply. We believe that when worker bees experience stress, their energy supply may shift from pro-movement to pro-resistance; this will lead to inadequate energy provision to the flight muscles, causing a reduction in wingbeat frequency and impairing the flight ability of the worker bees. To test this, the worker bees were treated with imidacloprid, and wing beats between the treatment groups were compared. Their glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and ATP contents were also measured, and their genes for energy metabolism and resistance were analyzed. The addition of adenosine improved the ATP content and helped recover the wingbeat frequency of the worker bees. The preliminary results obtained showed that wingbeat frequency and glucose content in the worker bees treated with imidacloprid were significantly lower than those in the control group. This result is consistent with our hypothesis and demonstrates that energy supply imbalances can prevent worker bees from returning to their hives. ¬© 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121920,332.0,,,,,,"['% reductions', 'adenosine', 'Adenosine', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'Apidae', 'Article', 'ATP content', 'bee', 'Bees', 'comparative study', 'controlled study', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'energy resource', 'Energy resources', 'Energy supplies', 'experimental study', 'flight', 'flight muscle', 'Food products', 'foraging behavior', 'frequency analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'glucose', 'Glucose', 'Glucose content', 'glycogen', 'homing behavior', 'Honey bee', 'Honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'Metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'physiological response', 'physiological stress', 'remediation', 'trehalose', 'wing', 'wingbeat frequency', 'Wingbeat frequency', 'worker bee', ""Workers'""]",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161702033&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.121920&partnerID=40&md5=e996b704d7601d0d98dc2e1b6f1c5c73,Scopus,,0,,0,457

49,396,JOUR,Physiological responses of the stingless bee Partamona helleri to oral exposure to three agrochemicals: impact on antioxidant enzymes and hemocyte count,"['Botina, L.L.', 'Barbosa, W.F.', 'Viana, T.A.', 'de Oliveira Faustino, A.', 'Martins, G.F.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Agrochemicals pose significant threats to the survival of bees, yet the physiological impacts of sublethal doses on stingless bees remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to three commercial formulations of agrochemicals [CuSO4 (leaf fertilizer), glyphosate (herbicide), and spinosad (bioinsecticide)] on antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde content (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and total hemocyte count (THC) in the stingless bee Partamona helleri. Foragers were exposed to lethal concentrations aimed to kill 5% (LC5) of CuSO4 (120¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) or spinosad (0.85¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) over a 24-h period. Glyphosate-exposed bees received the recommended label concentration (7400¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1), as they exhibited 100% survival after exposure. Ingestion of CuSO4 or glyphosate-treated diets by bees was reduced. Levels of NO and catalase (CAT) remained unaffected at 0¬†h or 24¬†h post-exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher at 0¬†h compared to 24¬†h, although insignificantly so when compared to the control. Exposure to CuSO4 reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity at 0¬†h but increased it after 24¬†h, for both CuSO4 and glyphosate. MDA levels decreased after 0¬†h exposure to CuSO4 or spinosad but increased after 24¬†h exposure to all tested agrochemicals. THC showed no difference among glyphosate or spinosad compared to the control or across time. However, CuSO4 exposure significantly increased THC. These findings shed light on the physiological responses of stingless bees to agrochemicals, crucial for understanding their overall health. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34790-w,31.0,42,54648,54658,,,"['agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'Animals', 'antioxidant', 'Antioxidants', 'Antioxidants enzymes', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bioinsecticide', 'Bioinsecticides', 'biopesticide', 'blood cell', 'catalase', 'Catalase', 'Cellular immunity', 'Cellulars', 'drug effect', 'Enzymes', 'Fertilizers', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosates', 'Hemocytes', 'herbicide', 'Herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'immunity', 'Leaf fertilizer', 'metabolism', 'nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide', 'Oral exposure', 'Oxidative stress', 'Physiological models', 'physiological response', 'Physiological response', 'physiology', 'pollution exposure', 'spinosad', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'survival', 'Total hemocyte counts', 'Weed control']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202610317&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-34790-w&partnerID=40&md5=b8e841d5900007b3da045b2bfa1ae36b,Scopus,,0,,0,459

To address this knowledge gap, we assessed the mortality and acute toxicity (LD 50 ) of 3 common agricultural insecticides (clothianidin, fipronil, and diazinon) on as many as 6 species of Japanese wild bees ( Andrena prostomias Perez , Apis cerana honshuensis Tkalcu , Bombus hypocrita Perez , and Eucera spp.; all or any of them). The datasets were obtained via standard acute toxicity testing, with assessment of mortality at 24 and 48 h after exposure to the insecticides.

594,50,JOUR,Chronic exposure to imidacloprid or thiamethoxam neonicotinoid causes oxidative damages and alters carotenoid-retinoid levels in caged honey bees (Apis mellifera),"['Gauthier, M.', 'Aras, P.', 'Paquin, J.', 'Boily, M.']",Scientific Reports,"Over the last decade, the persistent dwindling of the populations of honey bees has become a growing concern. While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid ‚Äì IMI or thiamethoxam ‚Äì THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), Œ±-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (Œ±-carotene and Œ±-cryptoxanthin) and Œ±-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees. This would merit further investigation as these compounds are important in various aspects of bees‚Äô health. Overall, this study contributes to the development of biomonitoring tools for the health of bees and other pollinators. ¬© 2018, The Author(s).",2018///,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-34625-y,8.0,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056067652&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-34625-y&partnerID=40&md5=d023147184001268f7cd12722e43fe07,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,461

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid. The results are helpful to explain that imidacloprid impairs the cognitive functions and possesses the delayed and time cumulative effect.",2019/03/30/,2019,10.1016/j.jprot.2018.12.022,196.0,,69,80,1874-3919,WOS:000460716800007,,,,,,,0,,0,462

If two species are similarly sensitive to a toxin their dose-response relationships will be similar. We propose a method to facilitate comparison between dose-response relationships, namely the response-response relationship, which can be applied to any biomarkers whose responses to the same pollutant are measured across a similar range of doses. We apply the method to bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) exposed to a dietary pesticide, imidacloprid, and we investigate both lethal and sublethal biomarkers. Results: We found cross-species similarity in dose-dependent responses, but only in certain sublethal biomarkers. In honey bees, sublethal biomarkers were more sensitive than mortality. In bumble bees, fecundity was the most sensitive biomarker. Conclusion: Our results provisionally suggest the existence of cross-species generalities. The greater sensitivity of sublethal biomarkers than mortality suggests that testing protocols which are overly focussed on mortality may underestimate the ecological impacts of toxic pollutants.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.010,437.0,,55,60,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200005,,,"['Oomen, PA', 'Thompson, H']",,,,0,,0,463

In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicities of CYA and SUL on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae reared in vitro. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the median lethal dose (LD50): CYA 0.007, 0.014, 0.028, 0.056 and 0.112 Œºg larva‚àí1; SUL 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 Œºg larva‚àí1. In the chronic toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the LD50: CYA 0.00512, 0.0128, 0.032, 0.08 and 0.2¬†Œºg larva‚àí1; SUL 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0¬†Œºg larva‚àí1. The acute LD50 values of CYA and SUL were 0.047 and 11.404 Œºg larva‚àí1, respectively. Larvae acutely exposed to SUL had significantly lower body weight than controls, but those exposed to CYA showed no difference. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and LD50 values of the chronic toxicity tests for each insecticide were 0.00512 and 0.064 Œºg larva‚àí1 for CYA, and 0.0625 Œºg larva‚àí1 and 0.212 Œºg larva‚àí1 for SUL, respectively. Larvae chronically exposed to SUL emerged as bees with deformed wings, reaching adult deformation rates of over 50%; however, CYA had no effect on adult deformation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to CYA increased larval mortality but did not cause any adult deformation, whereas SUL exposure increased pupal mortality and caused wing deformation in newly emerged bees.

In a 15-day cage experiment, three cohorts of one-day-old sister bees emerged in incubators, were distributed into cages, and maintained at three different temperatures (26¬†¬∞C, 32¬†¬∞C, 38¬†¬∞C). Each cohort was fed a protein patty and three concentrations of imidacloprid-tainted sugar (0¬†ppb, 5¬†ppb and 20¬†ppb) ad libitum. Honey bee mortality, syrup and patty consumption were monitored daily over 15¬†days. Bees were sampled every three days for a total of five time points. RT-qPCR was used to longitudinally assess gene regulation of Vg, mrjp1, Rsod, AChE-2 and Trx-1 using RNA extracted from whole bee bodies. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier models show that bees kept at both non-optimal temperatures (26¬†¬∞C and 38¬†¬∞C) were more susceptible to imidacloprid, with significantly higher mortality (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the control. At 32¬†¬∞C, no differences in mortality (P = 0.3) were recorded among treatments. In both imidacloprid treatment groups and the control, the expression of Vg and mrjp1 was significantly downregulated at 26¬†¬∞C and 38¬†¬∞C compared to the optimal temperature of 32¬†¬∞C, indicating major influence of ambient temperature on the regulation of these genes. Within the ambient temperature groups, both imidacloprid treatments exclusively downregulated Vg and mrjp1 at 26¬†¬∞C. AChE-2 and the poorly characterized Rsod gene were both consistently upregulated at the highest temperature (38¬†¬∞C) compared to the ideal temperature (32¬†¬∞C) in all treatment groups. Trx-1 showed no effect to both temperature and imidacloprid treatments and was regulated in an age-related manner.

Here, we applied a laboratory standard procedure (the proboscis-extension response conditioning) in order to assess which processes, acquisition, memory consolidation and/or memory retrieval were compromised after bees were fed either with thiacloprid or the formulation of thiacloprid named Calypso¬Æ at different sublethal doses. Extinction and generalization tests allowed us to investigate whether bees respond to a learned stimulus, and how selectively.

The present study was aimed towards establishing the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of three pesticides viz. carbamate (carbaryl), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) in honeybees through feeding bioassay laboratory trial. Deleteriousness was confirmed through mortality rate, number of survival bees, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), total protein (TP) levels, AChE gene transcription level, and gut tissues histological analysis of exposed honeybees. Mean mortality rate was calculated for 96 h interval at three different concentrations of tested pesticides (5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg L-1), and LC50 values calculated for 48 and 96 h interval. AChE enzyme and TP level are determined by ELIZA and spectrophotometer, respectively. Results revealed that imidacloprid had the lowest LC50 (0.477 ng/bee) values as compared with carbaryl and chlorpyrifos. High mortality rate was observed at highest dose, being impidacloprid have more lethal effects as compared with other pesticides. Similarly, biochemical analysis revealed that imidiacloprid and chlorpyrifos significantly (P <= 0.05) increased AChE and TP levels, whereas carbaryl significantly (P <= 0.05) decreased them. Similarly, probe based RT qPCR revealed that imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatments significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the AChE level whereas carbaryl decreased it.

373,190,JOUR,Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Young Adult Honeybee Behaviour,"['Go√±alons, C', 'Farina, WM']",PLOS ONE,"Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015/10/21/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10.0,10,,,1932-6203,WOS:000363248400070,,,,,,,0,,0,471

However, since few decades, managed bee colonies have declined worldwide. This phenomenon is considered to be multifactorial, with a strong emphasis on both parasites and pesticides. Infection by the parasite Nosema ceranae and exposure to pesticides can contribute to adverse effects, resulting in a perturbation of the honeybee physiology. We thus hypothesized that probiotic treatment could be promising to treat or prevent these disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on N. ceranae-infected and intoxicated honeybees (by the insecticide thiamethoxam and the fungicide boscalid). For this purpose, experiments were conducted with five probiotics. Among them, Pediococcus acidilactici (PA) showed the best protective effect against the parasite and pesticides. PA significantly improved the infected honeybee lifespan as prophylactic and curative treatments (respectively 2.3 fold and 1.7 fold). Furthermore, the exposure to pesticides induced an increase of honeybee mortality compared with the control group (p < .001) that was restored by the PA treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on honeybee lifespan, the PA administration did not induce changes in the gut bacterial communities (neither in abundance or diversity). N. ceranae and the pesticides were shown to deregulate genes involved in honeybee development (vitellogenin), immunity (serine protease 40, defensin) and detoxification system (glutathione peroxidase-like 2, catalase), and these effects were corrected by the PA treatment. This study highlights the promising use of PA to protect honeybees from both pathogens and pesticides. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.11.006,163.0,,138,146,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078283823&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=fd220fdc25a53410206da78292c76117,Scopus,,0,,0,472

Besides synthetic insecticides biological compounds such as spinosad are used in agriculture and organic farming against insect pests. However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.013,378.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067047889&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.06.013&partnerID=40&md5=f68712a866c4f5d0606542d373257fce,Scopus,,0,,0,474

The THC was not altered with the insecticide exposure and/or bacterial infection. However, the DHC of the bees changed with the imidacloprid exposure and/or bacterial infection. The number of prohemocytes (stem cells) increased in bees exposed to imidacloprid, but it did not change after the bacterial infection. The number of plasmatocytes (phagocytic cells) increased in imidacloprid-exposed and uninfected bees and decreased in infected bees regardless of the exposure to imidacloprid. On the other hand, there was a reduction of granulocytes, the most active immune cells, after imidacloprid exposure and an increase of granulocytes after the infection. Previous studies have shown that the neonicotinoids exposure can impair the immune system of bees.

Considering the ecological and economic relevance of native bees, such as Scaptotrigona postica, and the insufficient studies on the effects of pesticides on their behavior and physiology, improving the current knowledge on this issue is essential. Therefore, this study investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, and glyphosate on the behavior and fat body cells of S. postica. Pesticide ingestion decreased the walking distance and mean velocity of bees compared to the control and solvent control groups. The oenocytes of the control groups were spherical, with central nuclei containing decondensed chromatin, and the trophocytes presented irregular morphology, with cells varying in shape and the cytoplasm filled with vacuoles and granules. However, bees exposed to pesticides showed extensive cytoarchitectural disruption in the fat body, such as vacuolization and shape changes in oenocytes and altered nuclei morphology in trophocytes. Moreover, pesticide exposure increased the number of atypical oenocytes and altered trophocytes, except for the PYR group, which showed a lower number of atypical oenocytes. Caspase-positive labeling significantly increased in all exposed bee groups. Alternatively, TLR4 labeling was significantly decreased in the exposed groups compared to the control groups. There was a significant increase in HSP90 immunolabeling in all exposed groups compared to the control. These findings reinforce the importance of research on the sublethal effects of low pesticide concentrations on key neotropical pollinators and prove that these toxic substances can impair their detoxification and immune defense. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168072,907.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'antibody labeling', 'apoptosis', 'Apoptosis', 'Article', 'Atypicals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body fat', 'caspase', 'cell', 'Cell death', 'cell granule', 'cell structure', 'cell vacuole', 'cells by function', 'chromatin', 'Control groups', 'controlled study', 'cytoplasm', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'Eco-toxicology', 'Ecology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'fat', 'Fat Body', 'Fat body cells', 'fat pad', 'fungicide', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosates', 'heat shock protein 90', 'Herbicides', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Labelings', 'Morphology', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Neotropics', 'nonhuman', 'oenocyte', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide use', 'Pesticides', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'pyrachlostrobin', 'pyraclostrobin', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'solvent', 'stingless bee', 'sublethal concentration', 'Sublethal effects', 'toll like receptor 4', 'trophocyte', 'unclassified drug', 'velocity', 'walking distance']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175094565&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.168072&partnerID=40&md5=0e49e41638f2caecbc9cbb9bf47c7524,Scopus,,0,,0,476

Defining them is thus one of the main challenges of a risk assessment scheme design. In the light of the scientific publications on the subject, the existing risk coefficients and methodologies used for the toxicity evaluation under international guidelines result questionable. Results: LD50 values have shown to be variable. Prolonged effects following single contact can sometimes be observed when measuring the acute toxicity. The trigger value (10) of the risk coefficient results as inadequate. The toxicity derived from the exposure to substances continuously available for bees at sub-lethal doses needs to be evaluated separately, given the wide differences between acute and chronic lethal effects of pesticides. Conclusions: The observation period of the mortality tests should be lengthened as long as mortality increases, and while control mortality remains acceptable. Whenever active substances can pollute bees' food sources, first tier tests should include laboratory tests: (1) on adult bees with: (a) acute toxicity tests; (b) chronic toxicity tests; (c) behavioural tests; and (2) larvae toxicity tests.

However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy.

We have developed a panel of primers and assessed the genotoxicity of the following pesticides: imidacloprid, rotenone, deltamethrin, difenocanozole, malathion, metribuzin, penconazole, esfenvalerate, and dithianon. All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA. The mtDNA damage was observed for all studied pesticides. Most of the studied pesticides caused significant damage to mtDNA in vitro and in vivo when ingested.

As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative) were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10-10,000 Œºg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 Œºg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 Œºg/kg) at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of imidacloprid. Olefin LD50 values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The 5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a LD50 four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40% mortality at 1,000 ng/bee (10,000 Œºg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity, worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 Œºg/L of imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was consumed at the mean rate of 12 Œºl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and 10 Œºg/kg). Thus, all tested compounds were toxic at doses 30 to 3,000 (olefin), 60 to 6,000 (imidacloprid), 200 to 20,000 (5-OH-imidacloprid), and > 1,000 to 100,000 (remaining metabolites) times lower than those required to produce the same effect in acute intoxication studies.

Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system.

194,1047,JOUR,Modeling disruption of Apis mellifera (honey bee) odorant-binding protein function with high-affinity binders,"['Mayack, BK']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION,"Chemical toxins pose a great threat to honey bee health because they affect memory and cognition, diminish immunity, and increase susceptibility to infection, resulting in decreased colony performance, reproduction, and survival. Although the behavioral effects of sub-lethal chemical exposure on honey bees have been intensively studied, how xenobiotics affect olfaction, at the molecular level, still needs to be elucidated. In the present work, in silico tools, such as molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict if environmental chemicals have stronger binding affinities to honey bee antennal odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) than the representative floral odors citralva, eugenol, and the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine. Based on structural analysis, 21 chemicals from crop pesticides, household appliances, cosmetics, food, public health-related products, and other sources, many of which are pervasive in the hive environment, have higher binding affinities than the floral odors. These results suggest that chemical exposures are likely to interfere with the honey bee's sense of smell and this disruptive mechanism may be responsible for the lower associative learning and memory based on olfaction found in bees exposed to pesticides. Moreover, bees mainly rely on olfactory cues to perceive their environment and orient themselves as well as to discriminate and identify their food, predators, nestmates, and diseased individuals that need to be removed with hygienic behavior. In summary, sub-lethal exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to colony collapse in several ways from the disruption of proper olfaction functioning.",2023/05//undefined,2023,10.1002/jmr.3008,36.0,5,,,0952-3499,WOS:000943001100001,,,,,,,0,,0,483

For honey bees subjected to pesticide spray, toxicity is assessed by thorax contact to account for all possible contact exposures. In the present study, the authors tested 6 active substances with different hydrophobicity. For the first time, the authors demonstrated that it is possible to induce mortality by pesticide contact with only the wings of the honey bee. The toxicities induced by contact with the wings and thorax were similar, with the wing median lethal dose (LD50) being 0.99 to 2.23 times higher than that of the thorax. This finding demonstrates that the wings represent a relevant route of exposure in the honey bee. In a second approach, the authors estimated the air volume displaced by the wings during 1 beating cycle to be 0.51¬±0.03cm3, which corresponds to a volume of 116.8¬±5.8cm3s-1 at a wing beat frequency of 230 Hz. The authors then tested realistic scenarios of exposure for bees flying through a pesticide cloud at different concentrations. In the worst-case scenario, the dose accumulated during the flight reached 525ngbee-1s-1. These results show that the procedure used to assess the risk posed by contact with pesticides could be improved by accounting for wing exposure. ¬© 2015 SETAC.",2015///,2015,10.1002/etc.3014,34.0,9,1983,1988,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940452695&doi=10.1002%2fetc.3014&partnerID=40&md5=2135053c8346d0b1fee3c90542692fe8,Scopus,,0,,0,484

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals. Relevant future perspectives are briefly addressed to integrate MoA, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and toxicokinetic information for the refinement of single-chemical/combined toxicity predictions and risk estimates at different levels of biological organization in the bee health context.",2020/09/15/,2020,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139243,735.0,,0048-9697,WOS:000542562100009,,,,,,,,,0,,0,485

However, the use of pesticides, specifically neonicotinoids, in agroecosystems has led to a decline in these pollinating organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the topical (contaminated mist) and residual (contaminated food) acute effect of the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) on a stingless bee species (native to Brazil) with wide geographical distribution (Tetragonisca angustula) and two species restricted to certain regions (Tetragonisca fiebrigi and Tetragonisca weyrauchi) to determine LC10‚Äì48¬†h and LC50‚Äì48¬†h. The bees were exposed to various concentrations of IMI, in both topical and residual effect tests, and the results showed that low concentrations of the insecticide adversely affected the survival of all three species, with T. angustula being the most sensitive. The study also compared the sensitivity of the three species to the standard insecticide Dimethoate, and the results confirmed that T. angustula was the most sensitive. The findings of this study provide crucial ecotoxicological information, particularly concerning the residual effects of neonicotinoids on stingless bees. This evidence reinforces the urgent need to expand research on the effects of neonicotinoids on these important pollinators, so commonly found in nature and meliponaries. In addition, this research contributes significantly to filling the existing knowledge gap about the effects of pesticides on bee species native to Brazil, bringing to light the potential risks that these chemicals pose to the survival of these pollinators and emphasizing the urgent need for efforts of conservation in favor of these precious pollinating agents. ¬© 2023, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s13592-023-01043-7,54.0,6,,,,,"['bee', 'Brazil', 'Ecotoxicology', 'geographical distribution', 'imidacloprid', 'Neotropical Region', 'Non-target organisms', 'Residual effect', 'survival', 'Survival', 'Topical effect', 'toxicity']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85179369257&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-023-01043-7&partnerID=40&md5=0ebc1e6fe5bcfafe45ea7b20512439d8,Scopus,,0,,0,486

The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/Œºl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.001,156.0,,36,43,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061441396&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=27060647642889ad6ee1c69f9f3627d9,Scopus,,0,,0,487

However, flupyradifurone was shown in acute toxicity tests to be several orders of magnitude less toxic to western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) than many other insecticides targeting insect nAChRs. The underlying reasons for this difference in toxicity remains unknown and were investigated here. Pharmacokinetic studies after contact application of [14C]flupyradifurone to honey bees revealed slow uptake, with internalized compound degraded into a few metabolites that are all practically non-toxic to honey bees in both oral and contact bioassays. Furthermore, receptor binding studies revealed a lack of high-affinity binding of these metabolites to honey bee nAChRs. Screening of a library of 27 heterologously expressed honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of flupyradifurone: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3. Transgenic Drosophila lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less susceptible to flupyradifurone when compared to control flies, confirming the importance of these P450s for flupyradifurone metabolism in honey bees. Biochemical assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BOMFC) indicated a weak, non-competitive inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by flupyradifurone. In contrast, the azole fungicides prochloraz and propiconazole were strong nanomolar inhibitors of these flupyradifurone metabolizing P450s, explaining their highly synergistic effects in combination with flupyradifurone as demonstrated in acute laboratory contact toxicity tests of adult bees. Interestingly, the azole fungicide prothioconazole is only slightly synergistic in combination with flupyradifurone ‚Äì an observation supported by molecular P450 inhibition assays. Such molecular assays have value in the prediction of potential risks posed to bees by flupyradifurone mixture partners under applied conditions. Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of the identified P450 genes in all honey bee life-stages, with highest expression levels observed in late larvae and adults, suggesting honey bees have the capacity to metabolize flupyradifurone across all life-stages. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the low intrinsic toxicity of flupyradifurone to honey bees and offer a new, more holistic approach to support bee pollinator risk assessment by molecular means. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112247,217.0,,,,,,"['4-Butyrolactone', 'adult', 'aerobic metabolism', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'binding affinity', 'bioassay', 'biochemical analysis', 'butenolide', 'carbon 14', 'contact bioassay', 'controlled study', 'cytochrome', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'cytochrome P6AQ1', 'cytochrome P9Q2', 'cytochrome P9Q3', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'Drosophila', 'enzyme kinetics', 'enzyme structure', 'female', 'flupyradifurone', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'gene expression', 'gene expression regulation', 'gene identification', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'in vitro study', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'metabolism', 'metabolite', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'oral bioassay', 'P450', 'pest control', 'pharmacokinetics', 'physiology', 'pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'prochloraz', 'propiconazole', 'protein expression', 'prothioconazole', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'receptor binding', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'safety', 'scanning electron microscopy', 'synergism', 'Synergism', 'synergistic effect', 'tissue distribution', 'toxicity test', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicogenetics', 'Toxicogenetics', 'toxicogenomics', 'triazole derivative', 'Triazoles', 'unclassified drug', 'validation study']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104682585&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112247&partnerID=40&md5=f354e85b43a93450221db965c545b476,Scopus,,0,,0,488

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates. ¬© 2020.

The mechanism behind the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on honeybees has attracted considerable interest, yet it remains unknown due to the limited insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in honeybees. Herein, we demonstrated the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDIMSI) for the spatiotemporal visualization of neonicotinoids, such as N-nitroguanidine (dinotefuran) and Ncyanoamidine (acetamiprid) compounds, administered by oral application or direct contact, in the whole-body section of honeybees. The MSI results revealed that both dinotefuran and acetamiprid can quickly penetrate various biological barriers and distribute within the whole-body section of honeybees, but acetamiprid can be degraded much faster than dinotefuran. The degradation rate of acetamiprid is significantly decreased when piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is applied, whereas that of dinotefuran remains almost unchanged. These two factors might contribute to the fact that dinotefuran affords a higher toxicity to honeybees than acetamiprid. Moreover, the toxicity and degradation rate of acetamiprid can be affected by co-application with tebuconazole. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the discrepant toxicity between dinotefuran and acetamiprid does not lie in the difference in their of various barriers of but in the degradation rate of neonicotinoid pesticides within honeybee tissues. Moreover, new perspectives are given to better understand the causes of the current decline in honeybee populations posed by insecticides, providing guidelines for the precise use of conventional agrochemicals and the rational design of novel pesticide candidates.

The active ingredient imidacloprid has action on the nervous system of the insects. However, little has been studied about the actions of the insecticide on nontarget organs of insects, such as the Malpighian tubules that make up the excretory and osmoregulatory system. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid in Malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera. In the tubules of treated bees, we found an increase in the number of cells with picnotic nuclei, the lost of part of the cell into the lumen, and a homogenization of coloring cytoplasm. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolization. We confirmed the increased occurrence of picnotic nuclei by using the Feulgan reaction, which showed the chromatin compaction was more intense in the tubules of bees exposed to the insecticide. We observed an intensification of the staining of the nucleus with Xylidine Ponceau, further verifying the cytoplasmic negative regions that may indicate autophagic activity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry experiments showed TUNEL positive nuclei in exposed bees, implicating increased cell apoptosis after chronic imidacloprid exposure. In conclusion, our results indicate that very low concentrations of imidacloprid lead to cytotoxic activity in the Malpighian tubules of exposed bees at all tested times for exposure and imply that this insecticide can alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013///,2013,10.1002/jemt.22199,76.0,5,552,558,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875932526&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22199&partnerID=40&md5=095fa40511ee3488e63a065d4d6c8361,Scopus,,0,,0,494

The present study recorded six leafcutter bee species within the family Megachilidae and order Hymenoptera (Megachile hera Bingham, M. conjuncta Fabricius, M. lanata Fabricius, Pseudomegachile sp., Osmia sp., and Coelioxys sp.) foraging on chickpea flowers. Four bio-insecticides (B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki, Ha-NPV, NSKE, Neem oil) and three synthetic insecticides (Spinosad, Novaluron, Emamectin benzoate) along with control were evaluated for their efficacy against target pest and pollinators. The foraging of leafcutter bees was significantly higher in bio-insecticide-treated plots than in synthetic-insecticide-treated plots. B. thuringiensis and Ha-NPV were at par in reducing the maximum larval population of H. armigera while causing the least disturbance in the foraging behavior of leafcutter bees.

Honeybees were treated orally with imidacloprid at 20 and 50 Œºg kg-1 bee. Imidacloprid was metabolised relatively quickly and thoroughly. Twenty minutes after the beginning of imidacloprid ingestion, the sum of the residues from the three compounds amounted to only 70% of the actual given dose. Imidacloprid, 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin represented, respectively, 50%, 9% and 8% of the actual ingested dose. Six and 24h, respectively, after ingestion of imidacloprid at 20 and 50 Œºg kg -1 bee, imidacloprid could no longer be detected in the honeybee. Imidacloprid had a half-life ranging between 4.5 and 5h and was rapidly metabolised into 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin. Except 5-hydroxyimidacloprid in the 20 Œºg kg-1 treatment, these two metabolites presented a peak value 4h after ingestion of the 20 and 50 Œºg kg-1 doses. This time fully coincided with the appearance of mortality induced by imidacloprid after acute oral intoxication. These results suggested that the immediate neurotoxicity symptoms are due to the action of imidacloprid, whereas 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and/or olefin are involved in honeybee mortality. In addition, it was likely that the 30% of residues undetected 20min after intoxication were imidacloprid metabolites, although not 5-hydroxyimidacloprid or olefin. Thus, 5-hydroxyirnidacloprid and olefin could not be the major metabolites in the worker bees. ¬© 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.",2004///,2004,10.1002/ps.772,60.0,3,,,291,296,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1442327234&doi=10.1002%2fps.772&partnerID=40&md5=8892af9145c8cc4f6ffb537b2ddcab88,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,496

Neonicotinoid pesticides impair learning, fitness, colony health, and pollination, but most studies on how they affect bee learning have focused on olfactory learning. We tested the effects of field realistic doses of 0.8 ng/bee and 1.34 ng/bee of the neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam (TMX), on bee visual learning. We adapted a T-maze bioassay and classically conditioned bees to associate sugar reward with a simulated flower color (blue or yellow light) in a choice assay. At 1.34 ng/bee, TMX significantly reduced correct choices in the final learning trial as compared to the control treatment. There was no TMX effect in our 1-h memory test. We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices. Behaviors (falling, trembling, and rapid abnormal movements) were significantly increased by both TMX doses as compared to the control treatment. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on bee visual learning should be further studied and incorporated into Risk Assessment protocols. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.110367,193.0,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079859511&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.110367&partnerID=40&md5=735a403dbd18697c85bed7c8f5573d2f,Scopus,,0,,0,497
560,549,JOUR,Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica,"['Syama, P.S.', 'Sreeranjit Kumar, C.V.']",Sociobiology,"Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. ¬© 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

84,913,JOUR,Toxicity to honey bees Apis mellifera adansonii of three insecticides used in cotton cultivation in Benin,"['Zoclanclounon, D.G.', 'Paraiso, A.A.', 'Boulga, J.', 'Akogbeto, F.', 'Paraiso, G.', 'Yeyi, C.']",Journal of Entomology,"Background and Objective: Protection and preservation of bees are a pledge in a sustainable and environment-friendly agriculture. The economic contribution of the insect‚Äôs pollinators to world agriculture is estimated at billions of dollars. However, non-judicious choice of pesticides and absence of good plant protection practices, represent a real danger to bees. The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of three insecticides commonly used in cotton protection on bees Apis mellifera adansonii in Benin. Materials and Methods: In this context, bees were taken from hives and transported to the laboratory. Active ingredients and different doses used were as followed: Emamectin benzoate, beta-cyfluthrin+imidacloprid and lamdex+chlorpyrifos at doses of: 2150 nanograms per bee, 125 nanograms per bee, 75, 50, 25, 12.5√ó103, 6, 2.5 and 1.25-0.96 ng per bee, depending on the active ingredient. Each treatment included three replications consisting of 25 bees. Bees were anaesthetized with ether before treatment. Each bee received by topical application on the pronotum, 1 ŒºL of the formulation. Results: Observations were made after 2, 10, 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that, even the lowest doses of the pesticides: 0.96, 7.25 and 21.5 ng per b showed mortality higher than 90% to bees, 48 h after application. An insecticide with active ingredients including beta-cyfluthrin (45 g L‚Äì1), which is a pyrethroid and Imidacloprid (100 g L‚Äì1), a neonicotinoid actually forbidden in many European countries showed very high toxicity to honey bees, indicating values of the LD50 varying from 19.9 ng per bee for 10 h exposure to 1.1√ó10‚Äì2 ng per bee for 18 h and 5√ó10‚Äì4 ng per bee for 36 h. Conclusion: Results of the study indicated the urgent need of good plant protection practices in the frame of sustainable agriculture and bee‚Äôs preservation and conservation. Promotion of strategies as part of the dissemination of good agricultural practices in plant protection is a guarantee which should ensure sustainable agriculture and environmental, human and biodiversity protection. These studies showed the urgency of the integrated plant protection in order to promote good agricultural practices for honey bee‚Äôs protection. ¬© 2016 Deo Gracias Zoclanclounon et al.",2016///,2016,10.3923/je.2016.161.169,13.0,05-Jun,161,169,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991730426&doi=10.3923%2fje.2016.161.169&partnerID=40&md5=f44798c0db3a1f50c059a34cf4d7bb24,Scopus,,0,,0,499

9,422,JOUR,Imidacloprid increases the prevalence of the intestinal parasite Lotmaria passim in honey bee workers,"['Erban, T.', 'Parizkova, K.', 'Sopko, B.', 'Talacko, P.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Jarosova, J.', 'Votypka, J.']",Science of the Total Environment,"A challenge in bee protection is to assess the risks of pesticide-pathogen interactions. Lotmaria passim, a ubiquitous unicellular parasite in honey bees, is considered harmful under specific conditions. Imidacloprid causes unpredictable side effects. Research indicates that both L. passim and imidacloprid may affect the physiology, behavior, immunity, microbiome and lifespan of honey bees. We designed cage experiments to test whether the infection of L. passim is affected by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. Workers collected at the time of emergence were exposed to L. passim and 2.5 Œºg/L imidacloprid in the coexposure treatment group. First, samples of bees were taken from cages since they were 5 days old and 3 days postinfection, i.e., after finishing an artificial 24 h L. passim infection. Additional bees were collected every two additional days. In addition, bees frozen at the time of emergence and collected from the unexposed group were analyzed. Abdomens were analyzed using qPCR to determine parasite load, while corresponding selected heads were subjected to a label-free proteomic analysis. Our results show that bees are free of L. passim at the time of emergence. Furthermore, imidacloprid considerably increased the prevalence as well as parasite loads in individual bees. This means that imidacloprid facilitates infection, enabling faster parasite spread in a colony and potentially to surrounding colonies. The proteomic analysis of bee heads showed that imidacloprid neutralized the increased transferrin 1 expression by L. passim. Importantly, this promising marker has been previously observed to be upregulated by infections, including gut parasites. This study contributes to understanding the side effects of imidacloprid and demonstrates that a single xenobiotic/pesticide compound can interact with the gut parasite. Our methodology can be used to assess the effects of different compounds on L. passim. ¬© 2023 The Author(s)",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166973,905.0,,,,,,"['analysis of variance', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'cell culture', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'Food products', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'lifespan', 'limit of quantitation', 'liquid chromatography', 'Lotmaria passim', 'microbiome', 'nanoliquid chromatography', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'parasite', 'parasite load', 'Parasite-', 'Parasites', 'parasitology', 'pathogen', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'prevalence', 'Prevalence', 'proteomics', 'Proteomics', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'Risk assessment', 'Side effect', 'solubility', 'Sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'Synergistic effect', 'transferrin', 'transferrin 1', 'Transferrin 1 precursor', 'Trypanosomatidae', 'Trypanosomatina', 'unclassified drug', ""Workers'""]",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171731066&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166973&partnerID=40&md5=1540486a9f2c41405d6b4c4b60821257,Scopus,,0,,0,501
80,734,JOUR,Synergistic toxicity and physiological impact of thiamethoxam alone or in binary mixtures with three commonly used insecticides on honeybee,"['Wang, Y.', 'Zhang, W.', 'Shi, T.', 'Xu, S.', 'Lu, B.', 'Qin, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Apidologie,"As one of the most widely used insecticides, thiamethoxam (Th) plays an important role in agriculture pest control but is hazardous to the health of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica). In agricultural practice, several types of insecticides are often applied simultaneously, but their synergistic effects on honeybees remain elusive. Here, we treated honeybees with various binary mixtures of insecticides in which a sublethal dose of Th was mixed with three other common insecticides: Œª-cyhalothrin (Œª-cy), Œ≤-cypermethrin (Œ≤-cy), and abamectin (Ab). The mortality rates of the groups treated with the insecticide mixtures were higher than that obtained with the pesticides alone. Specifically, the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab combinations exerted a synergistic effect (P < 0.05) on bees and resulted in significantly higher mortality than that obtained with the single treatments. However, the Th + Œ≤-cy mixture had no synergistic effect (P > 0.05) on bees, and the mortality rate of this group was almost identical to those of the groups administered these pesticides alone. Furthermore, the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab mixtures significantly suppressed the activity and expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are key detoxification enzymes in insects. This result suggests that the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab combinations at a given concentration adversely affect the survival of honeybees.

However, traditional environmental risk assessment is only carried out based on ecotoxicological data of single substances. In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L‚àí1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L‚àí1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators. Meanwhile, the activities of SOD, caspase 3, caspase 9, and PPO, as well as the expressions of six genes (abaecin, dorsal-2, defensin-2, vtg, caspase-1, and CYP6AS14) associated with oxidative stress, immune response, lifespan, cell apoptosis, and detoxification metabolism were noteworthily varied in the individual and mixture challenges than at the baseline level. These data revealed that it is imminently essential to investigate the combined toxicity of pesticides since the toxicity evaluation from individual compounds toward honey bees may underestimate the toxicity in realistic conditions.

364,27,JOUR,Concentration- and time-dependent toxicity of commonly encountered pesticides and pesticide mixtures to honeybees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Bommuraj, V', 'Chen, Y', 'Birenboim, M', 'Barel, S', 'Shimshoni, JA']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Honeybees are exposed to a wide range of pesticides for long periods via contaminated water, pollen and nectar. Some of those pesticides might constitute health hazards in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Time-dependent toxicity profiles for many applied pesticides are lacking, despite the fact that such profiles are crucial for toxicological evaluations. Therefore, we sought to determine the time-dependent toxicities of pesticides/pesticide metabolites frequently found in Israeli beehives, namely, amitraz metabolites, N'-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-methylformamidine (DMPF) and N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-formamide (DMF), coumaphos, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, acetamiprid and dimethoate (toxic reference). By applying accepted methodological approaches such as the modified Haber's rule (product of concentration and exposure duration leads to a constant effect) and comparisons between cumulative doses at different time points, we determined the time-dependent toxicities of these pesticides. We also studied the mixture toxicities of frequently occurring pesticide combinations and estimated their potential contributions to the overall toxicities of neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid was the only pesticide that complied with Haber's rule. DMPF, dimethoate and imidacloprid exhibited time-diminished-toxicities. In contrast, DMF and acetamiprid exhibited time-reinforced toxicities. Neither the binary mixtures nor the tertiary mixtures of DMF, DMPF and coumaphos at 10 times their environmentally relevant concentrations potentiated the neonicotinoids' toxicities. DMPF and imidacloprid were found to present the greatest hazard to honeybees, based on their 50% lethal cumulative dose and 50% lethal time. Amitraz's instability, its low detection frequency and high toxicity profile of its metabolite, DMPF, lead us to the conclusion that DMPF constitutes the actual toxic entity responsible for amitraz's toxic effect.

443,131,JOUR,Imidacloprid intensifies its impact on honeybee and bumblebee cellular immune response when challenged with LPS (lippopolysacharide) of Escherichia coli,"['Walderdorff, L', 'Laval-Gilly, P', 'Bonnefoy, A', 'Falla-Angel, J']",JOURNAL OF INSECT PHYSIOLOGY,"Insect hemocytes play an important role in insects' defense against environmental stressors as they are entirely dependent on their innate immune system for pathogen defense. In recent years a dramatic decline of pollinators has been reported in many countries. The drivers of this declines appear to be associated with pathogen infections like viruses, bacteria or fungi in combination with pesticide exposure. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the impact of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, on the cellular immune response of two pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) during simultaneous immune activation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of Escherichia coli. For this purpose the phagocytosis capacity as well as the production of H2O2 and NO of larval hemocytes, exposed to five different imidacloprid concentrations in vitro, was measured. All used pesticide concentrations showed a weakening effect on phagocytosis with but also without LPS activation. Imidacloprid decreased H2O2 and increased NO production in honeybees. Immune activation by LPS clearly reinforced the effect of imidacloprid on the immune response of hemocytes in all three immune parameters tested.

Sublethal doses might, therefore, impair neural processes necessary for adaptive experience dependent behaviour and thus reduce the fitness of pollinating insects on the individual and community level. First, the question was addressed whether clothianidin has an aversive taste for honey bees and concluded with both a laboratory and a semi-field experiment that bees are unable to distinguish between control and contaminated sucrose solutions. In the laboratory, proboscis extension response conditioning was performed with forager bees exposed to different concentrations of clothianidin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.8 ng/bee)before learning, after learning during memory consolidation, and just before memory retention. These tests at different timings allowed uncovering an impairment of the consolidation and retrieval of memory due to the exposure to clothianidin. It was concluded that an acute exposure to clothianidin has an adverse effect on memory processing in honey bees. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.05.007,180.0,,139,145,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065440636&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2019.05.007&partnerID=40&md5=ac12e9fc192623db689b1baeded4658c,Scopus,,0,,0,507
305,1050,JOUR,Honey bee (Apis mellifera) exposomes and dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with Nosema ceranae infection,"['Broadrup, RL', 'Mayack, C', 'Schick, SJ', 'Eppley, EJ', 'White, HK', 'Macherone, A']",PLOS ONE,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) health has been severely impacted by multiple environmental stressors including parasitic infection, pesticide exposure, and poor nutrition. The decline in bee health is therefore a complex multifactorial problem which requires a holistic investigative approach. Within the exposome paradigm, the combined exposure to the environment, drugs, food, and individuals' internal biochemistry affects health in positive and negative ways. In the context of the exposome, honey bee hive infection with parasites such as Nosema ceranae is also a form of environmental exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to xenobiotic pesticides and other environmental chemicals increases susceptibility to N. ceranae infection upon incidental exposure to the parasite. We further queried whether these exposures could be linked to changes in conserved metabolic biological pathways. From 30 hives sampled across 10 sites, a total of 2,352 chemical features were found via gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF) in extracts of honey bees collected from each hive. Of these, 20 pesticides were identified and annotated, and found to be significantly associated with N. ceranae infection. We further determined that infected hives were linked to a greater number of xenobiotic exposures, and the relative concentration of the exposures were not linked to the presence of a N. ceranae infection. In the exposome profiles of the bees, we also found chemicals inherent to known biological metabolic pathways of Apis mellifera and identified 9 dysregulated pathways. These findings have led us to posit that for hives exposed to similar chemicals, those that incur multiple, simultaneous xenobiotic stressors have a greater incidence of infection with N. ceranae. Mechanistically, our results suggests the overwhelming nature of these exposures negatively affects the biological functioning of the bee, and could explain how the decline in bee populations is associated with pesticide exposures.",2019/03/07/,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0213249,14.0,3,,,1932-6203,WOS:000460638800056,,,,,,,0,,0,508

Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding. This research sheds light on pesticides‚Ä≤ probable inhibitory effects on SDH, a vital enzyme in honey bee energy production and mitochondrial function.

Among them, Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides might act in combination and lead to a higher honeybee mortality. We investigated the molecular response of honeybees exposed to N. ceranae, to insecticides (fipronil or imidacloprid), and to a combination of both stressors. Midgut transcriptional changes induced by these stressors were measured in two independent experiments combining a global RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach with the screening of the expression of selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Although N. ceranae-insecticide combinations induced a significant increase in honeybee mortality, we observed that they did not lead to a synergistic effect. According to gene expression profiles, chronic exposure to insecticides had no significant impact on detoxifying genes but repressed the expression of immunity-related genes. Honeybees treated with N. ceranae , alone or in combination with an insecticide, showed a strong alteration of midgut immunity together with modifications affecting cuticle coatings and trehalose metabolism. An increasing impact of treatments on gene expression profiles with time was identified suggesting an absence of stress recovery which could be linked to the higher mortality rates observed. ¬© 2014 Aufauvre et al.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091686,9.0,3,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898636008&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0091686&partnerID=40&md5=7242b0ce2eb0667f8fd2ff08489d5f78,Scopus,,0,,0,511

The challenges posed by novel and reemerging pathogens on bee health means we need to improve our understanding of the immune system, an important barrier to infections and disease. Despite the importance of solitary bees, which are ecologically relevant, our understanding of the genomic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying their immune potential, and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence it is limited. To improve our understanding of the genomic architecture underlying immunity of a key solitary bee pollinator, we characterized putative immune genes of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis. In addition, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets to determine how sexes differ in immune gene expression and splicing but also how pesticide exposure may affect immune gene expression in females. Through comparative genomics, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of more than 500 putative immune-related genes. We found genome-wide patterns of sex-biased gene expression, with greater enrichment of immune-related processes among genes with higher constitutive expression in males than females. Our results also suggest an up-regulation of immune-related genes in response to exposure to two common neonicotinoids, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the gene repertoire, regulation and expression differences in the sexes of O. bicornis, as well as providing additional support for how neonicotinoids can affect immune gene expression, which may affect the capacity of solitary bees to respond to pathogenic threats. ¬© 2022 The Authors.

In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and drug metabolism.

Such widespread application can pose risks to pollinator insects, particularly to honeybees (Apis mellifera); therefore, the evaluation of the harmful effects of acetamiprid is necessary. Recent studies report behavior and gene expression dysfunction in honeybees, related to acetamiprid contamination. However, most studies do not consider potential metabolism disorders. To examine the effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on the hemolymph metabolism of honeybees, worker bee larvae(2 days old) were fed with sucrose water containing different concentrations of acetamiprid (0, 5, and 25 mg/L) until capped (6 days old). The hemolymph (200 ŒºL) of freshly capped larvae was collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall, increasing acetamiprid exposure induced greater metabolic variations in worker bee larvae(treated groups compared to untreated). In the positive ion mode, 36 common differential metabolites in the acetamiprid-treated groups were screened from the identified differential metabolites. Of these, 19 metabolites were upregulated, and 17 were downregulated. 10 common differential metabolites were screened in the negative ion mode. 3 metabolites were upregulated, and 7 metabolites were downregulated. These common metabolites included traumatic acid, indole etc. These commonly differentiated metabolites were classified as compounds with biological roles, lipids, and phytochemical compounds, and others. The metabolic pathways of common differentiated metabolites with significant differences (P < 0.05) included the metabolism of tryptophan, purines, phenylalanine, etc. As the concentration of acetamiprid increased, the content of traumatic acid increased, the content of tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine and indole decreased, and the content of lipids also decreased. Our results revealed that the damage to honeybee larvae increased when the acetamiprid solution formulations residue in their food had a concentration higher than 5 mg/L, causing metabolic disorders in various substances in larvae. Analysis of these metabolic processes can provide a theoretical basis for further research on the metabolism of acetamiprid-treated honeybees and elucidate the detoxification mechanisms. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114716,254.0,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'comparative study', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'down regulation', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'hemolymph', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee larvae', 'indole', 'insect larva', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'kynurenine', 'larva', 'Larva', 'lipid', 'Lipids', 'liquid chromatography', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometry', 'metabolic disorder', 'metabolic fingerprinting', 'metabolic regulation', 'metabolism', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'phenylalanine', 'phytochemical', 'purine', 'sublethal dose', 'sucrose', 'sugar intake', 'traumatic acid', 'tryptophan', 'Tryptophan', 'unclassified drug', 'unsaturated fatty acid', 'upregulation']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149329442&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.114716&partnerID=40&md5=1a2438fb811339d64936a616dc9239b0,Scopus,,0,,0,516

One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100).

A previous study revealed that this is due to enhanced oxidative metabolism of FPF, mediated by three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), including CYP6AQ1. Therefore, we followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in FPF metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis on four stingless bee species, including Frieseomelitta varia, Heterotrigona itama, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonula carbonaria to identify CYP6AQ1-like functional orthologs. Three non-Meliponini, but tropical bee species, i.e., Ammobates syriacus, Euglossa dilemma and Megalopta genalis were analyzed as well.

Heterologous expression in High Five insect cells of these functional orthologs revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a preference for the O-debenzylation of bulkier substrates. Competition assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BOMFC) with these enzymes indicated inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by increasing concentrations of FPF. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/ MS analysis revealed the capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolize FPF by hydroxylation in vitro at various levels, indicating a conserved FPF detoxification potential in different (neo)tropical bee species including Meliponini.

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-72041-3,10.0,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093829332&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-72041-3&partnerID=40&md5=a24ef869a003dc0e843503bf437dbbbc,Scopus,"['animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'circadian rhythm', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'honey', 'Honey', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory', 'Memory', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic agent', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'sleep', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Navigation', 'spatial orientation']",,,,0,,0,520

We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph.

The toxicity of fungicides based on thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil were investigated individually and in combination, and with the insecticides. Results showed that stingless bees were more susceptible to insecticides than honeybees. The commercial fungicides thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil caused low mortality, regardless of concentration; however, their combination was as toxic as imidacloprid to both species, and over 400-fold more toxic than deltamethrin for A. mellifera.

63,866,JOUR,Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Bachofer, S.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Pollution,"Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72¬†h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in¬†vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.105,220.0,,1264,1270,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999648368&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2016.10.105&partnerID=40&md5=a474edd83a460346afb01361a49d6299,Scopus,,0,,0,523

To reduce population density of M. alternatus, thiacloprid has been sprayed by aircrafts on pine forests. Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not. Consequently, thiacloprid sprayed by aircraft may be an effective control agent for Monochamus beetle adults without negative effect on honey bees, but aerial application to prevent expansion of pine wilt disease should be reassessed. ¬© 2020 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1111/1748-5967.12482,51.0,2,,,83,89,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092628018&doi=10.1111%2f1748-5967.12482&partnerID=40&md5=0c6befc5cec85b2189292ccf9729ab95,Scopus,"['Non-target insects', 'Pine wilt disease', 'Pine wood nematode', 'Toxicity']",,,,0,,0,524

Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail.

The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology.

Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU.

For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 Œºg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 Œºg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. ¬© 2015.

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7‚Äì2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to Œ±8 subunit of nAChR of Apis mellifera. The Œ±8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations. ¬© 2019 The Authors",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.048,130.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067030671&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2019.05.048&partnerID=40&md5=34ecfc9dc6470b6f2a0d591bc7f7df71,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,533

Among these pesticides are those that are highly toxic to Apis mellifera (honey bees). However, little non-Apis bee species toxicity data exist; especially pertaining to beef cattle feed yard-derived pesticides. Therefore, we conducted a series of 96-h contact toxicity tests with blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria) using three neonicotinoids, two pyrethroids, and two macrocyclic lactones. Neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and clothianidin) were most toxic with LD50 values ranging from 2.88 to 26.35 ng/bee, respectively. Macrocyclic lactones (abamectin and ivermectin) were also highly toxic to O. lignaria with LD50 estimates of 5.51‚Äì32.86 ng/bee. Pyrethroids (permethrin and bifenthrin) were relatively less toxic with LD50 values greater than 33 ng/bee. Sensitivity ratios for each pesticide were calculated to relate O. lignaria LD50 values to existing honey bee toxicity data. All three neonicotinoids were more toxic to O. lignaria than A. mellifera, but pyrethroids and abamectin were relatively less toxic. Additionally, three of seven pesticides (43%) resulted in significantly different mass normalized LD50 values for male and female O. lignaria. These results indicate that non-Apis pollinators may be highly susceptible to pesticides originating from beef cattle feed yards, necessitating consideration of more stringent regulatory protections than those based on A. mellifera pesticide sensitivity. ¬© 2020 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111681,208.0,,,,,,"['abamectin', 'acute toxicity', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'calculation', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'dose response', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicity', 'environmental exposure', 'female', 'Female', 'Great Plains', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'ivermectin', 'lactone', 'Lactones', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'macrocyclic compound', 'Macrocyclic Compounds', 'macrolide', 'male', 'Male', 'Models, Theoretical', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'permethrin', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiological response', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'pyrethroid pesticide', 'sex difference', 'theoretical model', 'thiamethoxam', 'toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096681977&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111681&partnerID=40&md5=ce6552dc57071201233a00da02827cbe,Scopus,,0,,0,536

Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3‚Ä≤(2‚Ä≤), 5‚Ä≤-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated.

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. ¬© 2019 by the authors.",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10.0,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074627857&doi=10.3390%2finsects10110382&partnerID=40&md5=1d7cd991c5dc71ff1cccacd749911b7f,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,538

In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of botanical extracts with homemade preparations used in agroecological crops and their constituents on the bees Apis mellifera and Partamona helleri. Toxicity bioassays of adult bees were done by means of oral exposure and ingestion, using the insecticide imidacloprid as a positive control. Dietary consumption, respiration rate and bee flight were evaluated as sublethal parameters. Although some extracts were toxic to bees, survival was always higher compared to the results obtained with the imidacloprid, which was lethal to 100% of bees. In dietary consumption, P. helleri consumed less (5 mg/bee) in 3 h than A. mellifera (11 mg/bee), and P. helleri consumed less (7 mg/bee) in 24 h than A. mellifera (22 mg/bee).

The survivorship of treated bees was monitored and the expression of three immune-related genes, hymenoptaecin (AmHym), basket (AmBask) and lysozyme (AmLyso2) was analyzed at 24 and 72 hours post treatment (hpt), as well as that of the antioxidant-related gene vitellogenin (AmVit2), the poly-U binding factor (AmPuf68), and the detoxification gene cytochrome P450 (AmCYP9Q3).

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations.

Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

However, the lipids of their central nervous system have not been examined, even though they likely play a crucial role in the performance of cognitive process to perform intricate behaviors. Lipidomics has greatly advanced our understanding of neuropathologies in mammals and could provide the same for honey bees. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the brain lipidome of adult honey bees and to assess the effect of clothianidin (a neurotoxic insecticide) on the brain lipid composition, gene expression, and performance of self-grooming behavior under controlled conditions (cage experiments). Methods: After seven days of exposure to oral sublethal doses of clothianidin, the bees were assessed for self-grooming behavior; their brains were dissected to analyze the lipidome using an untargeted lipidomics approach and to perform a high throughput RNAseq analysis. Results: Compared to all other organisms, healthy bee brain lipidomes contain unusually high levels of alkyl-ether linked (plasmanyl) phospholipids (51.42%) and low levels of plasmalogens (plasmenyl phospholipids; 3.46%). This could make it more susceptible to the effects of toxins in the environment. A positive correlation between CL 18:3/18:1/14:0/22:6, TG 6:0/11:2/18:1, LPE 18:0e and intense self-grooming was found. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid altered PC 20:3e/15:0, PC 16:0/18:3, PA 18:0/24:1, and TG 18:1/18:1/18/1 levels, and affected gene expression linked to GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and energy metabolism that may be partially responsible for the altered lipid composition. Conclusion: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral disorders. ¬© 2022",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jare.2021.08.007,37.0,,,,75,89,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113674681&doi=10.1016%2fj.jare.2021.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=3402264eaea4aabfd4c6f44eec4b5507,Scopus,"['Brain', 'Grooming', 'Honey bees', 'Lipidome', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Social immunity']",,,,0,,0,547

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013///,2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4.0,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000346774000013,,,,,,,0,,0,548

However, given the economic and ecological importance of stingless bees such as Melipona scutellaris in the Neotropical region, as well as the lack of studies on the effect of insecticides on these bees, toxicity tests for stingless bees should be carried out to understand whether insecticides affect both species of bees in the same manner. Thus, the present study quantified the differential sensitivity of the bees M. scutellaris and A. mellifera to the oral ingestion of the insecticide thiamethoxam by determining the mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), and their effect on the insecticide target organ, the brain. The results showed that the stingless bee is more sensitive to the insecticide than A. mellifera, with a lower LC50 of 0.0543 ng active ingredient (a.i.)/ŒºL for the stingless bee compared to 0.227 ng a.i./ŒºL for A. mellifera. When exposed to a sublethal concentration, morphological and ultrastructural analyses were performed and evidenced a significant increase in spaces between nerve cells of both species.

Honeybees were treated orally with 100 Œºg of 14C-imidacloprid per kg of bee, a dose close to the median lethal dose. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity in honeybee was 25 h. Haemolymph was the compartment with the lowest and rectum that with the highest level of total radioactivity during the whole study, with a maximum 24 h after treatment. Elimination half-life of imidacloprid in whole honeybee was 5 h. Imidacloprid was readily distributed and metabolised only by Phase I enzymes into five metabolites: 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxy- imidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and olefin and urea derivatives.

236,502,JOUR,Surrogate species in pesticide risk assessments: Toxicological data of three stingless bees species,"['Lourencetti, A.P.S.', 'Azevedo, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Environmental Pollution,"Discussions about environmental risk reassessment of pesticides have grown in the last decades, especially in tropical and subtropical regions since the diversity of bee species in these places is quite different. Stingless bees are highly affected by pesticides, and toxicity information is necessary to include them in the regulatory process of countries that hosts a diversity of these species. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50), estimate the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) and compared the sensitivity of three species of stingless bees exposed to the commercial formulation of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TMX). The LD50 was estimated based on the LC50 determined in the present study (LC50 = 0.329 ng a.i./ŒºL for Tetragonisca angustula; 0.624 ng a.i./ŒºL for Scaptotrigona postica, and 0.215 ng a.i./ŒºL for Melipona scutellaris). Considering these data, toxicity endpoints were used to fit species sensitive distribution curves (SSD) and determine the sensitivity ratio. The results showed that all the stingless bees tested are more sensitive to TMX than the Apis mellifera, the model organism used in ecotoxicological tests. Regarding the oral LC50, the most susceptible and most tolerant species were M. scutellaris > T. angustula > S. postica > A. mellifera. Following the same evaluated pattern, for the LD50 (considering the weight of the bees - ng a.i./g bee), we have: M. scutellaris > S. postica > T. angustula > A. mellifera, and without the weight considered (ng a.i./bee): T. angustula > M. scutellaris > S. postica > A. mellifera. The different sensitivities among stingless bee species highlight the importance of inserting more than one surrogate species with a variety of sizes in research and protocol development. Additionally, the research suggests the need to investigate patterns regarding the influence of body mass on pesticide sensitivity among stingless bee species. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120842,318.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body mass', 'body weight', 'Body weight', 'controlled study', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Environmental risks', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Melipona scutellaris', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'Population distribution', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'sensitivity analysis', 'sensitivity ratio', 'species', 'species difference', 'species sensitivity distribution', 'Species sensitivity distribution', 'Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD)', 'Species sensitivity distributions', 'stingless bee', 'surrogate species', 'Tetragonisca angustula', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'toxicology', 'Tropical regions', 'Tropics']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144079658&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2022.120842&partnerID=40&md5=76784e21ad6b201448cabf3e1b119948,Scopus,,0,,0,552

Previous reports have demonstrated the toxicity of this drug in activating oxidative stress resulting in high mortality in the honey bee Apis mellifera. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid have not been fully elucidated. In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload.

To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ‚àº10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae.

Except for CarE, the enzymic activities of GST and P450 were not influenced by chlorothalonil at NOAEC, while chronic exposure to acetamiprid slightly increased the activities of the three tested enzymes at NOAEC. Further, the exposed larvae showed significantly higher expression of genes involved in a series of different toxicologically relevant process following, including caste development (Tor (GB44905), InR-2 (GB55425), Hr4 (GB47037), Ac3 (GB11637) and ILP-2 (GB10174)), immune system response (abaecin (GB18323), defensin-1 (GB19392), toll-X4 (GB50418)), and oxidative stress response (P450, GSH, GST, CarE).

Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict contact acute toxicity (LD50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce. The analysis of the statistical parameters of this model and those published in the literature shows that our model is more efficient. The QSAR model was assessed according to the OECD principles for the validation of QSAR models. The calculated values for the internal and external validation statistic parameters (Q(2) and <(r(m)(2))over bar>are greater than 0.85. In addition to this validation, a mathematical equation derived from the ANN model was used to predict the LD50 of 20 other pesticides. A good correlation between predicted and experimental values was found (R (2) = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.14). As a result, this equation could be a means of predicting the toxicity of new pesticides.",2018/01//,2018,10.1007/s11356-017-0498-9,25.0,1,0944-1344,WOS:000419608400085,896,907,,,,,,,0,,0,558

It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L‚àí1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L‚àí1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees. Our study also provides important guidance for the rational application of pesticide mixtures to protect pollinators in agricultural production effectively. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161700,870.0,,,,,,"['acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'adult', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'apoptosis', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee toxicology', 'Bees', 'biological marker', 'biomarker', 'Biomarker', 'Chemical contamination', 'cyproconazole', 'Cyproconazole', 'cytochrome', 'cytochrome P450', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'down regulation', 'egg laying', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'enzyme', 'enzyme activity', 'Enzymes', 'female', 'fungicide', 'gene expression', 'homeostasis', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'Industrial poisons', 'innate immunity', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'LD50', 'lung function', 'male', 'Mixture effect', 'Mixture effects', 'nonhuman', 'occupational exposure', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'Pesticides', 'physiological stress', 'pollinator', 'Population statistics', 'protein expression', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'Risk assessment', 'signal transduction', 'Synergetic toxicity', 'Synergetics', 'synergism', 'synergistic effect', 'theoretical study', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid', 'Toxic effect', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity assay', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicology', 'unclassified drug', 'upregulation', 'working memory']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147246760&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.161700&partnerID=40&md5=9ac6a44f6016d8544a9e03a7c7b2a5c4,Scopus,,0,,0,559

Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

In this study, the nAChR Œ±1 subunit from Apis mellifera was first found to be narrowly tuned to different bee toxicity insecticides, namely, sulfoxaflor (SFX) and flupyradifurone (FPF). Hence, novel sulfoximine derivatives 7a-h were rationally designed and synthesized by introducing a benzo[d][1,3]dioxole moiety into a unique sulfoximine skeleton based on the binding cavity characteristics of AmelŒ±1/ratŒ≤2. The two electrode voltage clamp responses of 7a-h were obviously lower than that of SFX, indicating their potentially low bee toxicity. Besides, representative compounds 7b and 7g exhibited low bee toxicity (LD50 > 11.0 Œºg/bee at 48 h) revealed by acute contact toxicity bioassays. Molecular modelling results indicated that Ile152, Ala151, and Val160 from honeybee subunit AmelŒ±1 and Lys144 and Trp80 from aphid subunit MpŒ±1 may be crucial for bee toxicity and aphicidal activity, respectively. These results clarify the toxic mechanism of agonist insecticides on nontargeted pollinators and reveal novel scaffold sulfoximine aphicidal candidates with low bee toxicity.

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data.

The effects of imidacloprid at a dose that does not affect sensory or motor functions are studied on non-associative learning abilities in the honeybee. The behavioral procedure is the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Imidacloprid topically applied on the thorax (1 Œºl) at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee induces an increase of the gustatory threshold defined as the lowest concentration of a sucrose solution applied to the antennae able to elicit the PER. The ability of the honeybee to move in an open-field-like apparatus is impaired at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee. These effects are amplified with time and reach a maximum 60 min after application. The lowest dose of 1.25 ng/bee has no effect on the gustatory function but increases the motor activity and facilitates the PER habituation independently of time. This result fits our hypothesis that a slight activation of the cholinergic system with a low dose of imidacloprid can facilitate a simple form of learning in the honeybee. Arch. Insect Biochem.

Therefore, the sublethal effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on the survival and morphological parameters of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris were investigated in the present study. Cells from both non-target organs (Malpighian tubules and midgut) and target organs (brain) were analyzed for morphological alterations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The findings showed that when M. scutellaris foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100 = 0.000543 ng a. i./ŒºL), longevity was not reduced but brain function was affected, even with the non-target organs attempting to detoxify. The cellular damage in all the organs was mostly reflected in irregular nuclei shape and condensed chromatin, indicating cell death. The most frequent impairments in the Malpighian tubules were loss of microvilli, disorganization of the basal labyrinth, and cytoplasmic loss. These characteristics are related to an attempt by the cells to increase the excretion process, probably because of the high number of toxic molecules that reach the Malpighian tubules and need to be secreted. In general, damages that compromise the absorption of nutrients, excretion, memory, and learning processes, which are essential for the survival of M. scutellaris, were found.

Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

The one-day-old bees were exposed separately to diazinon, imidacloprid, paraquat, manganese, and thymol at concentrations of 0.22, 29.04, 55.69, 106.19, and 0.91 ppm, respectively. On the 21st day of exposure, the bees‚Äô responses to memory retention and sucrose responsiveness experiments were recorded after the training trial. In addition, PERs were recorded after OA injection. During the intervals, honey bees were exposed to the toxins topically. The expression levels of OA receptor genes, AmoctŒ±R1 and AmoctŒ≤R4, were measured. The sucrose responsiveness tests showed no significant differences between the bees stimulated with the control solutions or toxins. Moreover, our results indicated that memory retention significantly declined in honey bees exposed to toxins compared to the controls (P‚â§0.05). According to the findings, OA improved the memory retention of honey bees exposed to toxins (P‚â§0.05). The expression levels of AmoctŒ±R1 and AmoctŒ≤R4 genes significantly increased in the treated honey bees, especially those exposed to paraquat and manganese, after 30 min post-OA injection. It can be concluded that under chemical stress, OA administration encouraged honey bees to respond to a stimulus. Therefore, it can be added to a nutrient-enriched diet. ¬© 2023 International Bee Research Association.",2024///,2024,10.1080/00218839.2023.2186018,63.0,1,76,87,,,"['Apis mellifera meda', 'behavioral learning', 'biogenic amine', 'brain', 'memory retention', 'proboscis extension reflex']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149593072&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2023.2186018&partnerID=40&md5=0cbe6701fc048181a60c286beca57080,Scopus,,0,,0,571

Insect metamorphosis and response to external stress are altered by deleting CYP450 genes. In this study, we identified and analyzed a novel gene of CYP450 family, AccCYP6A13, from Apis cerana cerana, and explored its role in the response of Apis cerana cerana to adverse external stressors. It was found that the expression of AccCYP6A13 was spatiotemporal specificity. The expression level increased with age and reached its highest value in the adult stage. The primarily expressiong location were legs, brain, and epidermis of honeybees. Stress conditions can affect the expression of AccCYP6A13 depending on treatment times. RNA interference experiments have shown that knocking down AccCYP6A13 reduces antioxidant activity and deactivates detoxification enzymes, resulting in oxidative damage accumulation and a decline in detoxification capability in bees, as well as inhibiting numerous antioxidant genes. Additionally, knockdown of the AccCYP6A13 gene in Apis cerana cerana resulted in increased sensitivity to pesticides and increased mortality when treated with neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam. AccCYP6A13 overexpression in a prokaryotic system further confirmed its role in resistance to oxidative stress. To summarize, AccCYP6A13 may play an essential role in the normal development and response to environmental stress in Apis cerana cerana. Furthermore, this study contributed to the theoretical understanding of bee resistance biology. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105890,202.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192702662&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2024.105890&partnerID=40&md5=e0382c2d3624c819cdddc8efb484e28b,Scopus,"['AccCYP6A13', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis cerana cerana', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'genetics', 'insect protein', 'Insect Proteins', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid pesticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'oxidative stress', 'Oxidative stress', 'Oxidative Stress', 'physiological stress', 'RNA interference', 'RNA Interference', 'Stress, Physiological', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam']",,,,0,,0,573

Here, multiple fluorescence spectra, thermodynamic method, and molecular docking were used to study the interaction and the functional inhibition of imidacloprid to the recombinant CSP1 protein in Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity (Œªem¬†=¬†332¬†nm) of CSP1 could be significantly quenched by imidacloprid in a dynamic mode. During the quenching process, ŒîH > 0, ŒîS > 0, indicating that the acting forces of imidacloprid with CSP1 are mainly hydrophobic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the binding process. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the Œ±-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain. In addition, the binding of CSP1 to floral scent Œ≤-ionone was inhibited by nearly 50% of the apparent association constant (KA) in the presence of 0.28‚Äì2.53 ng/bee of imidacloprid, and the inhibition rate of nearly 95% at 3.75 ng/bee of imidacloprid at sublethal dose level.

However, the molecular bases mediated at the gene level remain to be discovered. Here, we found four heat shock protein DnaJB subfamily genes, DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14, from Apis cerana cerana, that all have J domains in their protein sequences. The expression levels of DnaJB6 and DnaJshv were upregulated by different degrees of heat stress, and the transcript level of DnaJB14 was gradually upregulated as the degree of heat stress increased, while the mRNA level of DnaJB13 was downregulated at multiple time points during heat stress treatment. The mRNA levels of all four DnaJBs were upregulated by cold and UV stress. In addition, the expression levels of DnaJB6, DnaJshv and DnaJB13 were reduced under abamectin, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl stresses. The transcript level of DnaJB14 was decreased by imidacloprid, cypermethrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl exposure but increased by abamectin and bifenthrin exposure. These results indicate that the demand of A. cerana cerana for these four DnaJBs differs under various stress conditions. To further explore the role of DnaJBs in the stress response, we successfully silenced DnaJshv and DnaJB14. The content of protein carbonyl was increased, while the content of VC, the enzymatic activities of CAT, GST, and SOD, the mRNA levels of many antioxidant-related genes, and the total antioxidant capacity were reduced after knockdown of DnaJshv and DnaJB14 in A. cerana cerana. These results indicate that silencing DnaJshv and DnaJB14 increases oxidative damage and decreases the antioxidant ability of A. cerana cerana. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14 are differentially expressed under stress conditions and play crucial roles in response to various stressors, possibly through the antioxidant signalling pathway.

In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise¬Æ 2FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58.6 mg a.i./L imidacloprid)+Domark (512.5 mg a.i. /L tetraconazole), Advise+Transform (58.5 mg a.i./L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a. i./L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20%, 15%, and 26% respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mga.i./L L- cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees.

At sublethal doses, these chemicals have been shown to negatively affect a number of behaviours, including performance of olfactory learning and memory, due to their interference with acetylcholine signalling in the mushroom bodies. Here we provide evidence that neonicotinoids can affect odour coding upstream of the mushroom bodies, in the first odour processing centres of the honeybee brain, i.e. the antennal lobes (ALs). In particular, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid, the most common neonicotinoid, in the AL glomeruli via in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with pulsed odour stimulation. Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016/12/01/,2016,10.1038/srep38110,6.0,,2045-2322,WOS:000389659800001,,,,,,,,,0,,0,578

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTSThe field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONSThe present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture.

7,381,JOUR,Design of environmentally friendly neonicotinoid insecticides with bioconcentration tuning and Bi-directional selective toxic effects,"['Zhao, YY', 'Li, Y']",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"A 3D-QSAR model was established with CoMSIA to characterize neonicotinoid insecticides. LgBCF values were used as the dependent variable and the molecular structures of 30 compounds were used as the independent variable. This model was used to design neonicotinoid insecticides with reduced bioconcentration. The contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model were used to evaluate substituted sites and different substituents that significantly affected the bioconcentration of neonicotinoid insecticides. The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in mediating various biological and pathological processes, involving transcriptional and gene regulation. The effects of dinotefuran on lncRNA expression and lncRNA function in the honey bee brain are still obscure. Results: Through RNA sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed following exposure to 0.01 mg/L dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d. In total, 312 lncRNAs and 1341 mRNAs, 347 lncRNAs and 1458 mRNAs, and 345 lncRNAs and 1155 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively.

Moreover, the DE lncRNA TCONS_00086519 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may serve as a competing endogenous RNA and a regulatory factor in the immune response to dinotefuran.

In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-Œ±-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicity by 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%. Finally, by calculating the resultant force from different types of non-bonded forces, the mechanism of the effect of the optimal application scheme on bees and pests under two scenarios was analyzed. The optimally combined scheme prepared by screening could provide the bi-directional selectivity to bees and pests. This study provides an important reference for reducing the environmental problems caused by pesticide application in farmland. ¬© 2022, African Association of Insect Scientists.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s42690-022-00875-7,42.0,5,,,3499,3511,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137432750&doi=10.1007%2fs42690-022-00875-7&partnerID=40&md5=c484132ca3b488769897053147bcae91,Scopus,"['Combined effect', 'Cotton', 'Insecticide combination', 'Lateral mixing', 'Longitudinal residue', 'Molecular dynamics simulation']",,,,0,,0,583

Thus, we investigated the agonist actions of neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin) on A. mellifera Œ±1 (AmŒ±1)/chicken Œ≤2 hybrid nAChRs in Xenopus laevis oocytes according to the subunit stoichiometry of (AmŒ±1)3(Œ≤2)2 and (AmŒ±1)2(Œ≤2)3 using voltage-clamp electrophysiology. ACh activated (AmŒ±1)3(Œ≤2)2 and (AmŒ±1)2(Œ≤2)3 nAChRs with similar current amplitude. We investigated the agonist activity of imidacloprid, thiacloprid and clothianidin for the two hybrid nAChRs and found that: 1) imidacloprid showed higher affinity than clothianidin, whereas clothianidin showed higher efficacy than imidacloprid for the nAChRs; 2) Thiacloprid showed the highest agonist affinity and the lowest efficacy for the nAChRs. The AmŒ±1/Œ≤2 subunit ratio influenced the efficacy of imidacloprid and thiacloprid, but hardly affected that of clothianidin. Hydrogen bond formation by the NH group in clothianidin with the main chain carbonyl of the loop B may account, at least in part, for the unique agonist actions of clothianidin on the hybrid nAChRs tested. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.02.011,166.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081242233&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.02.011&partnerID=40&md5=85653ef4befcda8166d5834df1065730,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,584

In this work, a phenylacetohydrazone compound VS-04 was found via scaffold hopping to exert good mortality rate against soybean aphids based on a double combinational strategy of virtual screening and bioassay technique. The molecular interaction mode to honeybee nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) for the newly found compound VS-04 obviously differed from that of the known imidacloprid. The newly synthesized phenylacetohydrazone compounds 3c and 3e caused soybean aphids to have a moderate mortality rate of approximately 70% at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. Importantly, the bee-toxicity study confirmed that compounds 3c and 3e showed much lower acute contact toxicity with LD50 value (30.35 and 124.4 mu g/bee) of 3 similar to 4 orders of magnitude than that of imidacloprid (0.019 mu g/bee). The hydrazone substructure of compound 3c was found to be a L-shape low-energy conformation confirmed by a crystal structure of its analog 3m and inversely point toward a subunit of honeybee receptor via a molecular interaction study, indicating its potential low bee-toxicity.

293,1021,JOUR,Effects of imidacloprid metabolites on habituation in honeybees suggest the existence of two subtypes of nicotinic receptors differentially expressed during adult development,"['Guez, D.', 'Belzunces, L.P.', 'Maleszka, R.']",Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior,"Habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) is age-dependent. Very young bees (‚â§7 days old) require significantly less trials to abolish the response to multiple sucrose stimulations than older bees (‚â•8 days old). A nicotinic agonist, imidacloprid, modifies this behaviour by increasing the number of trials in ‚â§7-day-old bees and by decreasing it in older bees [Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 76 (2001) 183.]. Here we tested our hypothesis that this effect is associated with a differential expression of two subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). By testing the effects of six metabolites of imidacloprid, we show that two of them, olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, modify the number of trials needed to habituate the PER in a contrasting manner. Olefin increases the number of trials in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid decreases the number of trials, but only in 8-day-old individuals. We conclude that olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid are specific agonists of two subtypes of an nAChR that are differentially expressed during adult maturation of young honeybees. Olefin is the agonist of an nAChR expressed in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid is the agonist of a late-onset nAChR that is activated in 8-day-old bees.

Here, the expression profiles and potential modulation networks of circRNAs in the brains of workers (Apis mellifera) were comprehensively investigated using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 33, 144, and 211 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified on the 1st, 5th and 10th days after exposure to dinotefuran, respectively.

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system.

Then, the mechanisms of bi-directional selective toxic effects and drug resistance were determined using homology modeling and molecular docking analyses. The results of the model showed that the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 12- positions of neonicotinoid insecticides strongly affected their toxicity, and that the introduction of bulky or electropositive groups at these positions could increase the pLC50 values. Using Compound 19 as a template, we designed 37 derivatives with greater toxicity (increased by 0.04‚Äì11.45%). Among them, 20 derivatives had bioconcentrations lower than that of Compound 19 (reduced by 0.38‚Äì147.88%). Further screening of Compound 19 and the 20 derivatives mentioned above by homology modeling and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) molecular docking analyses showed that 10 derivatives had bi-directional selective toxic effects against pests and bees. Further docking analyses of Compound 19 and these 10 derivatives identified that Derivative-33 showed decreased docking with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S transferase (GST) in pests and enhanced docking with these enzymes in bees, indicating bi-directional selective resistance for pests and bees. Accordingly, Derivative-33 was selected as a new insecticide with high toxicity to pests and low toxicity to bees (bi-directional selective toxicity), low resistance in pest populations, and high resistance in bee populations. This study provides valuable reference data and will be useful for the development of strategies to produce new environmentally friendly pesticides. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.08.055,164.0,,,,467,473,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051817245&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.08.055&partnerID=40&md5=c505c60f4b3e2fff4cb2bf86baeedeff,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,596

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024/08/29/,2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11.0,1,2196-5641,WOS:001303583400003,,,,,"['AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Cowpea aphid', 'Honeybee', 'NAChR', 'Neonicotinoids']",,,,0,,0,597

This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UV‚Äìvisible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's Œ±-helix content, suggesting structural alterations. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further elucidate the binding modes and stability of these interactions, highlighting the role of specific amino acids in CSP3's binding cavity. Findings provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms by which neonicotinoids may impair honeybee chemosensory function, offering implications for designing safer pesticides and understanding the broader ecological impact of these chemicals on pollinator health. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.133080,273.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195816026&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijbiomac.2024.133080&partnerID=40&md5=f7cb83d52d421378e32bc0183747f566,Scopus,"['affinity chromatography', 'Agricultural productivity', 'Amino acids', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Binding dynamics', 'Binding energy', 'Biodiversity', 'chemical structure', 'chemistry', 'chemosensory protein', 'Chemosensory protein', 'Chemosensory proteins', 'circular dichroism', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Dichroism', 'drug effect', 'Ecological relationships', 'Escherichia coli', 'fluorescence', 'Fluorescence', 'fluorescence intensity', 'honeybee', 'Hydrophobicity', 'insect protein', 'Insect Proteins', 'kanamycin', 'metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'molecular docking', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'molecular dynamics', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'molecular model', 'Molecular modeling', 'Multispectroscopy', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid analog', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Olfactory systems', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'protein', 'protein binding', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'sequence analysis', 'Silica', 'simulation', 'spectrofluorometry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectroscopic technique', 'spectroscopy', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'structure activity relation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'synchronous fluorescence', 'three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy', 'unclassified drug']",,,,0,,0,598

Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up-and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees.

Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites. Our work provides access to a new and simple in vitro tool to study honey bee phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics utilising the entire range of microsomal cytochrome P450s. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.014,161.0,,,,68,76,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065084111&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.04.014&partnerID=40&md5=fcecb464371b44cff9d79558f095a6dd,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,600

Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and >81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (>36, >49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee). The urea metabolite and 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited LD50 values of >99 500 and >121 500ng per bee, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the [3H]imidacloprid binding site in honeybee head membrane preparations is consistent with that anticipated for a nAChR. IC50 values for the displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by several metabolites such as olefine, 5-OH-, 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, urea and 6-CNA were 0.45, 24, 6600, > 100 000, and > 100 000nM, respectively.

383,569,JOUR,Melatonin enhances the antioxidant capacity to rescue the honey bee Apis mellifera from the ecotoxicological effects caused by environmental imidacloprid,"['Li, Z.', 'Duan, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Qin, Q.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees. Melatonin secretion may be a defense mechanism to mitigate imidacloprid toxicity. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113622,239.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'antioxidant', 'Antioxidant', 'antioxidant activity', 'Antioxidants', 'Apis mellifera', 'apoptosis', 'apoptosis inducing factor', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'caspase 3', 'Caspase 3', 'catalase', 'cell damage', 'controlled study', 'CYP4G11 gene', 'cytochrome P450', 'cytochrome P450 4G11', 'cytotoxicity', 'detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'enzyme activity', 'gene', 'gene expression', 'gene induction', 'glutathione', 'guaiacol peroxidase', 'hormone release', 'hormone synthesis', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'intestine cell', 'lipid peroxidation', 'malonaldehyde', 'melatonin', 'Melatonin', 'metabolism', 'midgut', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'oxidative stress', 'Oxidative stress', 'Pilot Projects', 'pilot study', 'protein expression', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'survival', 'thioredoxin reductase', 'tissue injury', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134600223&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2022.113622&partnerID=40&md5=dfb131e5e7edc48e5b87ea1ce00d95a6,Scopus,,0,,0,604

We investigated the expression patterns of AccPDIA6 in response to oxidative stress induced by H202, UV, HgC12, extreme temperatures (4 C, 42 C) and pesticides (thiamethoxam and hexythiazox) and found that AccPDIA6 was upregulated by these treatments. Western blot analysis indicated that AccPDIA6 was also upregulated by oxidative stress at the protein level. In addition, a survival test demonstrated that the survival rate of E. call cells expressing AccPDIA6 increased under oxidative stress, suggesting a possible antioxidant function of AccPDIA6. In addition, we tested the transcripts of other antioxidant genes and found that some of them were downregulated in AccPDIA6 knockdown samples. It was also discovered that the antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in AccPDIA6-silenced bees. Moreover, the survival rate of AccPDIA6 knockdown bees decreased under oxidative stress, implying that AccPDIA6 may function in the oxidative stress response by enhancing the viability of honeybees. Taken together, these results indicated that AccPDIA6 may play an essential role in counteracting oxidative stress.",2021/06//,2021,10.1016/j.pestbp.2021.104830,175.0,,0048-3575,WOS:000651442200005,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'antioxidant', 'Antioxidants', 'Apis cerana cerana', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Escherichia coli', 'genetics', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'oxidation reduction reaction', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'oxidative stress', 'Oxidative stress', 'Oxidative Stress', 'PDIA6', 'RNA interference (RNAi)', 'Site-directed mutagenesis', 'Survival function']",,,,0,,0,607

How such diversity influences neonicotinoid sensitivity of nAChRs of beneficial insect species remains poorly understood. We have identified a RIC-3 variant expressed most abundantly in the thoracic ganglia of honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers and investigated its effects on the functional expression and pharmacology of AmŒ±1/AmŒ±8/AmŒ≤1 and AmŒ±1/AmŒ±2/AmŒ±8/AmŒ≤1 nAChRs expressed in X. laevis oocytes.

In this context, the A. mellifera foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100: 0,0227 ng de thiamethoxam/ŒºL‚àí1 diet), a neurotoxic insecticide, for 8 days; and it was decided to investigate the insecticide effect on the brain by a shotgun proteomic approach followed by label-free quantitative-based proteomics. A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism.

Therefore, the effects of imidacloprid (IMI), the most used neonicotinoid, on the two main bioreceptors, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (nAChRŒ±1) of honeybees were examined to identify their roles in honeybee toxicity and possible binding sites which assist in selecting and designing neonicotinoids. In vivo, IMI showed a high inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 5.63 mg/L); however, the effect was much lower in vitro experiment (IC50 719 mg/L). This result induced us to examine the IMI effect on AChE gene expression which revealed that the AChE-2 gene expression was severely affected by IMI explaining the observed high enzyme inhibition. In addition, although toxicity increased by increasing exposure to IMI (LC50 2.9 mg/L after 4h and 0.75 mg/L after 48h), AChE was not elevated (IC50 5.63 and 5.52 mg/L respectively). Besides, Despite resuming most enzyme activity (77% during 2 h and 84.14% after 4 h), a high mortality level was observed with LC50 2.9 mg/L. These results reinforced that the observed high toxicity is a multifactor process. Accordingly, Molecular modeling and docking of IMI into honeybee AChE and nAChRŒ±1were also performed to examine their possible interactions and identify the important binding sites. Results models indicated that the first two binding sites in AChE were found in the esteratic subunit in the active site explaining the observed in vitro inhibition. In nAChRŒ±1, four of the highest five free energy binding sites are located in the large TM3-TM4 loop and one in the extracellular loops. Consequently, the present work revealed that IMI toxicity is attributed to various factors including direct interaction with both AChE and nAChRŒ±1 as well as downregulating AChE-2 gene expression. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141899,356.0,,,,,,"['acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Alpha subunit', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Binding energy', 'binding site', 'Binding sites', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding-sites', 'controlled study', 'down regulation', 'drug effect', 'enzyme', 'enzyme active site', 'enzyme activity', 'Enzyme activity', 'enzyme inhibition', 'Enzyme inhibition', 'experimental toxicity', 'Free energy', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes expression', 'genetics', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'in vitro study', 'in vivo study', 'insect protein', 'Insect Proteins', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'molecular docking', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'molecular model', 'Molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'nAChR', 'NAChR', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nervous system', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nicotinic receptor alpha1', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'pollination', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'Transmembranes', 'unclassified drug']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189431305&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.141899&partnerID=40&md5=0d59fc4d5808c83501fe2317b4746c96,Scopus,,0,,0,612

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 √ó 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana.

Due to its good systemicity and low toxicity to humans and animals, it has been widely used in agricultural production. Thus there is still a low residue in plants, and this sublethal dose residue can still cause adverse effects on the behavior and nervous system of flower-visiting insects like bees.„ÄêObjective„ÄëThe objective of this study is to clarify the effect of sublethal dose imidacloprid (a kind of neonicotinoid insecticides) on the nervous physiological and metabolism system of Apis cerana cerana„Äê. Method„ÄëIn this study, the worker bees were treated with two sublethal concentration gradient doses of 5 and 10 Œºg‚Ä¢L-1 imidacloprid for 10 days (three biological replicates). After total RNA was extracted, the resulting library was analyzed by RNA-seq. Throughput sequencing, and the bioinformatics technology was used to assemble and annotate the sequence de novo, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after sublethal doses imidacloprid treatment were analyzed by clustering and enrichment. Finally, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology was used to verify the DEGs related to the nervous and metabolic systems.„ÄêResult„ÄëA total of 9 sequencing libraries were obtained, the ratio of effective sequencing data exceeded 94.45%.

However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT‚ÄìPCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40¬∞C to 43¬∞C and 46¬∞C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown. Conclusion: AccTid plays a crucial role in A. cerana cerana stress responses and may mediate oxidative damage caused by various stresses. Our findings will offer fundamental knowledge for further investigations of the defence mechanism of A. cerana cerana against environmental stresses.

192,275,JOUR,Isolation of carboxylesterase (esterase FE4) from Apis cerana cerana and its role in oxidative resistance during adverse environmental stress,"['Ma, ML', 'Jia, HH', 'Cui, XP', 'Zhai, N', 'Wang, HF', 'Guo, XQ', 'Xu, BH']",BIOCHIMIE,"Carboxylesterases (CarEs) play vital roles in metabolising different physiologically important endogenous compounds and in detoxifying various harmful exogenous compounds in insects. Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples. Together, these data suggest that AcceFE4 may be involved in the oxidative resistance response during adverse stress.

In the honeybee, nAChRs are expressed in diverse structures including the primary olfactory centres of the brain, the antennal lobes (AL) and the mushroom bodies. Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were used to characterize the nAChRs present on cultured AL cells from adult honeybee, Apis mellifera. In 90% of the cells, applications of ACh induced fast inward currents that desensitized slowly. The classical nicotinic agonists nicotine and imidacloprid elicited respectively 45 and 43% of the maximum ACh-induced currents. The ACh-elicited currents were blocked by nicotinic antagonists methyllycaconitine, dihydroxy-Œ≤-erythroidine and Œ±-bungarotoxin. The nAChRs on adult AL cells are cation permeable channels. Our data indicate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult AL cells that differ from nAChRs on pupal Kenyon cells from mushroom bodies by their pharmacological profile and ionic permeability, suggesting that these receptors could be implicated in different functions. ¬© 2007 Springer-Verlag.",2008///,2008,10.1007/s10158-007-0062-2,8.0,1,,,19,29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-40149102554&doi=10.1007%2fs10158-007-0062-2&partnerID=40&md5=9d8c58b9e2c159bedcfaf27a786c586a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,619

The use of chaperone proteins has been key to successful functional expression of these receptors in heterologous systems, permitting functional and pharmacological studies of insect nAChRs with particular subunit composition. Here, we report the first use of the chaperone protein, NACHO, to enable functional expression of an insect nAChR, the Œ±6 subunit from Apis mellifera, in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is also the first report of functional expression of a homomeric insect Œ±6 nAChR. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology we show that the acetylcholine EC50 of the Œ±6 receptor is 0.88 ŒºM and that acetylcholine responses are antagonized by Œ±-bungarotoxin. Spinosad showed agonist actions and kept the ion channel open when co-applied with acetylcholine, reinforcing the Œ±6 nAChR subunit as a key molecular target for the spinosyn class of insecticide. The use of NACHO may provide a basis for future expression studies of insect Œ±6 nAChRs, potentially providing a tool for the discovery of novel insecticides. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.pestbp.2021.105030,181.0,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122641741&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2021.105030&partnerID=40&md5=a42a9b7e38233ba679c3a6f526a73692,Scopus,"['acetylcholine', 'Acetylcholine', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Functional expression', 'genetics', 'insect', 'Insecta', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'NACHO', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor', 'nicotinic receptor', 'oocyte', 'Oocytes', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'Xenopus laevis']",,,,0,,0,620

In this study, to ascertain the molecular mechanisms of P450s in the detoxification of Chinese honeybees, Apis cerana cerana Fabricius (A. c. cerana), we isolated and characterized four new P450 genes (Acc301A1, Acc303A1, Acc306A1, and Acc315A1). The open reading frames of the four genes are 1263 to 1608 bp in length and encode four predicted polypeptides of 499 to 517 amino acids in length. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that expression of all four genes was observed in all developmental stages. In addition, Western blot assays further indicated the RT-qPCR results that showed that the four genes were induced by pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, dichlorovos, and paraquat) treatments. Furthermore, we also used double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference to investigate the functions of Acc301A1, Acc303A1,and Acc306A1 in the antioxidant defense of honeybees.

However, little is known about whether OBPs perform other functions in insects, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. Within this study, an OBP gene (AccOBP10) was isolated and identified from A. c. cerana. Both homology and phylogenetic relationship analyses indicated that the amino acid sequence of AccOBP10 had a high degree of sequence identity with other members of the gene family. Analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that AccOBP10 mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the venom gland than in other tissues. The mRNA transcript expression of AccOBP10 was upregulated by low temperature (4 degrees C), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), pyridaben, methomyl and imidacloprid but downregulated by heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet light, vitamin C, mercuric chloride, cadmium chloride, paraquat and phoxim. Expression of AccOBP10 under abiotic stress was analysed by western blotting, and the results were consistent with those of qRT-PCR. And as a further study of AccOBP10 function, we demonstrated that knockdown of AccOBP10 by RNA interference could slightly increase the expression levels of some stress-related genes.

In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491 by in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 degrees C), heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and phoxim) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that AccCYP336A1 may play a very significant role in antioxidant defense against ROS damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the nature and properties of the nAChRs involved in these processes, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of nAChRs on cultured Kenyon cells of the MBs, using whole cell patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR. In all cells, applications of ACh as well as nicotinic agonists such as nicotine and imidacloprid induced inward currents with fast desensitization. These currents were fully blocked by saturating doses of the antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT), dihydroxy-beta-erythroidine (DHE), and methyllycaconitine (MLA) (MLA >= alpha-BGT >= DHE). Molecular analysis of ACh-responding cells revealed that of the 11 nicotinic receptor subunits encoded within the honeybee genome, alpha 2, alpha 8, and beta 1 subunits were expressed in adult Kenyon cells. Comparison with the expression pattern of adult AL cells revealed the supplementary presence of subunit alpha 7, which could be responsible for the kinetic and pharmacological differences observed when comparing ACh-induced currents from AL and Kenyon cells. Together, our data demonstrate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult MB Kenyon cells that differ from nAChRs on AL cells in both their molecular composition and pharmacological properties, suggesting that changing receptor subsets could mediate different processing functions depending on the brain structure within the olfactory pathway.",2011/10//,2011,10.1152/jn.00126.2011,106.0,4,0022-3077,WOS:000296092000002,1604,1613,,,,,,,0,,0,626
