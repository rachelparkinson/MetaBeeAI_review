510,719,JOUR,The impact of pollen quality on the sensitivity of bumblebees to pesticides,"['Barraud, A.', 'Vanderplanck, M.', 'Nadarajah, S.', 'Michez, D.']",Acta Oecologica,"With 2000 species currently recorded in Europe, bees are a highly diversified and efficient group of pollinating insects. Their decline could therefore lead to a risk for ecosystems functioning and crop yields. The drivers of this decline have been well documented in Europe and involve multiple factors such as pesticides, pathogens, poor nutrition, climate change, and their respective interactions. For pesticides, there is a lack of information concerning the impacts of exposure when the bees have access to pollen diet of different nutritional quality (e.g. variation in sterol and protein content). We performed bioassays on nine groups consisting of 10 Bombus terrestris microcolonies (i.e. queen less colonies) each in a fully crossed experiment including controls without pesticide, two different doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid (2 and 20 Œºg/L) and three pollen diets (i.e. Salix mix, cellulose-diluted Salix mix and cellulose-diluted Salix mix enriched with soy protein). All colonies were fed ad libitum with syrup and pollen. We measured the collection of pollen and syrup, the brood mass and the pollen efficacy (ratio of brood mass/pollen) at the end of the experiment. All these variables were affected by the imidacloprid doses, especially pollen efficacy, which was two and 10 times lower than the control for the 2 and 20 Œºg/L treatments, respectively. As expected, pollen efficacy was also affected by the pollen diet. However, when exposed to imidacloprid, the three different pollen diets did not affect micro-colonies performances. Overall, we show that diet quality does not affect sensitivity to imidacloprid exposure. It seems therefore that the negative effects of imidacloprid exposure cannot be compensated for by a pollen diet of high quality. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103552,105,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084259658&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2020.103552&partnerID=40&md5=a8c642efd52675587a10ca5e1a433a27,Scopus,,1,,1,1
508,631,JOUR,Impacts of neonicotinoid seed treatments on the wild bee community in agricultural field margins,"['Main, A.R.', 'Webb, E.B.', 'Goyne, K.W.', 'Abney, R.', 'Mengel, D.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Wild bees support global agroecosystems via pollination of agricultural crops and maintaining diverse plant communities. However, with an increased reliance on pesticides to enhance crop production, wild bee communities may inadvertently be affected through exposure to chemical residues. Laboratory and semi-field studies have demonstrated lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on limited genera (e.g., Apis, Bombus, Megachile), yet full field studies evaluating impacts to wild bee communities remain limited. Here, we conducted a two-year field study to assess whether neonicotinoid seed treatment and presence in environmental media (e.g., soil, flowers) influenced bee nest and diet guild abundance and richness. In 2017 and 2018, we planted 23 Missouri agricultural fields to soybeans (Glycine max) using one of three seed treatments: untreated (no insecticide), treated (imidacloprid), or previously-treated (untreated, but neonicotinoid use prior to 2017). During both years, wild bees were collected in study field margins monthly (May to September) in tandem with soil and flowers from fields and field margins that were analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. Insecticide presence in soils and flowers varied over the study with neonicotinoids infrequently detected in both years within margin flowers (0%), soybean flowers (<1%), margin soils (<8%), and field soils (~39%). Wild bee abundance and species richness were not significantly different among field treatments. In contrast, neonicotinoid presence in field soils was associated with significantly lower richness (ground- and aboveground-nesting, diet generalists) of wild bee guilds. Our findings support that soil remains an underexplored route of exposure and long-term persistence of neonicotinoids in field soils may lead to reduced diversity in regional bee communities. Future reduction or elimination of neonicotinoid seed treatment use on areas managed for wildlife may facilitate conservation goals to sustain viable, diverse wild bee populations. ¬© 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147299,786,,,,,,"['Abundance', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'agriculture', 'Agro-ecosystems', 'agroecosystem', 'Agroecosystems', 'Amino acids', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee functional guild', 'Bee functional guilds', 'Bees', 'chemistry', 'Crops', 'Cultivation', 'Ecosystems', 'Field margins', 'Field studies', 'flower', 'Forestry', 'Glycine max', 'guild', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'long term exposure', 'Megachile', 'Missouri', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitrogen fixation', 'nonhuman', 'plant seed', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'priority journal', 'relative abundance', 'Richness', 'seed', 'Seed', 'Seed treatment', 'Seeds', 'soil', 'Soils', 'soybean', 'species richness']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105282479&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.147299&partnerID=40&md5=d30b2e15046c896f8085308414251f63,Scopus,,1,,1,2

Effects of imidacloprid food stores contaminants were examined in subtropical colonies that experience reduced brood rearing and foraging during overwintering. Colonies were given treatment sugar syrup containing 0 ppb (control), 20 ppb (field relevant), or 100 ppb (above field relevant) imidacloprid over six weeks to simulate contaminated fall nectar. Colonies were evaluated immediately (post-treatment) and 10 weeks (mid-winter) after treatment to compare proximal and latent effects. Post-treatment 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies while 0 ppb colonies more brood than 20 ppb or 100 ppb colonies. Mid-winter 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies and 0 ppb colonies more brood than 100 ppb colonies. Colonies experienced seasonal declines in stored pollen but no treatment effects. Lower 100 ppb colony performance was associated with reduced effort rather than lifespan. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking revealed that workers had similar adult lifespans across treatments; however, 100 ppb workers engaged in activities outside the colony for less time than 0 ppb workers. Imidacloprid exposure affected queen but not worker nutritional physiology. Nurses retained well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (as indicated by head protein) across treatments. Mid-winter queens from 0 ppb colonies had marginally higher ovary protein than queens from 100 ppb colonies and more ovary lipids than queens from 20 ppb colonies. However, queen nutrient stores in non-reproductive tissues (fat bodies) did not differ across treatments.

Many studies describing negative effects have been criticized as the experimental protocol did not perfectly simulate real-life field scenarios. Here, we placed free-flying bumblebee colonies next to raspberry crops that were either untreated or treated with the neonicotinoid thiacloprid as part of normal farming practice. Colonies were exposed to the raspberry crops for a two week period before being relocated to either a flower rich or flower-poor site. Overall, exposed colonies were more likely to die prematurely, and those that survived reached a lower final weight and produced 46% fewer reproductives than colonies placed at control farms. The impact was more marked at the flower-rich site (all colonies performed poorly at the flower poor site). Analysis of nectar and pollen stores from bumblebee colonies placed at the same raspberry farms revealed thiacloprid residues of up to 771 ppb in pollen and up to 561 ppb in nectar.

In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed ‚Äúcarryover‚Äù effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. ¬© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

A growing body of research is demonstrating that, through various exposure routes, neonicotinoids can impact a suite of nontarget organisms including beneficial insects such as bees. However, to date, only a few studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoids in field settings. We assessed the relationship between agricultural crop soil neonicotinoid levels and wild bee abundance and diversity at 16 agricultural sites representing different soil neonicotinoid levels. We detected clothianidin at 11 sites, thiamethoxam at three sites; imidacloprid was not detected. Hedgerow and crop soils were consistent in terms of where clothianidin was detected; thiamethoxan was not detected in hedgerow soils. Based on model outcomes, fields with higher levels of soil neonicotinoids exhibited significantly lower wild bee abundance and diversity than those with low or no neonicotinoids detected. Crop soil neonicotinoid level, hedgerow floral resource abundance and crop type were consistent predictors of bee abundance across models; only neonicotinoid level and crop type were significant predictors of diversity.

One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers.

Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies - an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41559-017-0260-1,1,9,1308,1316,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027489115&doi=10.1038%2fs41559-017-0260-1&partnerID=40&md5=8d50cc8b91f5148c06906693418c5ee6,Scopus,,1,,1,11

While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments. ¬© 2017 Samson-Robert et al.",2017///,2017,10.7717/peerj.3670,2017,8,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027370657&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.3670&partnerID=40&md5=d0e9bf37441f530c8a45cca734d704db,Scopus,,1,,1,12

The bumble bees in late-sprayed crops also developed weaker colonies than in unsprayed crops. Dead bees with a high internal concentration of thiacloprid were found in one crop sprayed during the night at 35% flowering.

In 2013 the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices. It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.",2015/03/24/,2015,10.7717/peerj.854,3,,,,2167-8359,WOS:000352297200005,,,,,,,1,,1,15

While there is evidence suggesting that colony size may play an important role inmitigating neonicotinoid exposure in bees, mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests. Our results suggest that changes in both number of workers and nest architecture may contribute to making larger colonies less sensitive to pesticide exposure.",2019/03/04/,2019,10.3389/fevo.2019.00051,7,,,,2296-701X,WOS:000467399600001,,,,,,,1,,1,16

Median residues of thiamethoxam in pollen collected from honey bees after foraging on flowering seed treated maize were found to be between 1 and 7 Œºg/kg, median residues of the metabolite CGA322704 (clothianidin) in the pollen were between 1 and 4 Œºg/kg. In oilseed rape, median residues of thiamethoxam found in pollen collected from bees were between <1 and 3.5 Œºg/kg and in nectar from foraging bees were between 0.65 and 2.4 Œºg/kg. Median residues of CGA322704 in pollen and nectar in the oilseed rape trials were all below the limit of quantification (1 Œºg/kg). Residues in the hive were even lower in both the maize and oilseed rape trials, being at or below the level of detection of 1 Œºg/kg for bee bread in the hive and at or below the level of detection of 0.5 Œºg/kg for hive nectar, honey and royal jelly samples. The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring. We conclude that these data demonstrate there is a low risk to honey bees from systemic residues in nectar and pollen following the use of thiamethoxam as a seed treatment on oilseed rape and maize. ¬© 2013 Pilling et al.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0077193,8,10,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84886064005&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0077193&partnerID=40&md5=08bf230b8449fa8f445dc05138885719,Scopus,,1,,1,17
404,863,JOUR,The combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to thiamethoxam on the performance of bumblebee micro-colonies,"['Dance, C.', 'Bot√≠as, C.', 'Goulson, D.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the likely effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural intensification on bee declines. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.01.041,139,,194,201,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010734907&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2017.01.041&partnerID=40&md5=85f05ac1f9f19118d09fceb232bd37d7,Scopus,,1,,1,18

Various methods of chemical prevention of commercial winter and spring oilseed rape crops in field-realistic conditions were taken into account in the assessment. Pesticides were applied in accordance with the actual agricultural practice. Commercial crop protection products with thiamethoxam, clothianidin or imidacloprid were used as seed treatment. Formulations containing acetamiprid or thiacloprid were used for spraying. Fifteen healthy bee colonies were placed in close proximity to each of the oilseed rape fields throughout the blooming period. During florescence, the samples of nectar (directly from flowers and nectar flow from combs) and pollen loads were collected repeatedly. Samples of honey, bee bread and adult bees were taken one week after the end of plants flowering. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of analysed pestcicides modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used. The five of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiametoxam, acetamiprid and thiacloprid) were analyzed in multi-residue method with 0.1 - 10 ng/g limits of detection. Palynological analysis was done to determine the botanical origin of the nectar, honey and pollen. Development of bee colonies (brood area, worker biomass, colony health) was assessed every 3 weeks until the end of the beekeeping season. The amount of pollen collected by bees per hive, bee bread area and rape honey yield was also measured. The long-term effects of insecticides on bees were estimated using the same methods in April of the following year. All the neonicotinoid insecticides applied to control oilseed rape pests were present in the samples of nectar and pollen. Their residue levels were lower than the acute oral and contact LD50 values. Among five examined neonicotinoids, the most frequently detected were: thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and acetamiprid. These substances were present in 65, 64, and 51% of the nectar samples and in 37, 62, and 45% of the pollen samples, respectively. The highest level of residues were noted after the thiamethoxam seed treatment; on average, 4.2 and 3.8 ng/g in the nectar and pollen samples. In the nectar and pollen samples from winter rape fields, lower levels of neonicotinoid residues were found in comparison to spring rape samples. The contaminations of neonicotinoids applied as seed dressing in nectar samples were significantly higher in comparison to the pollen samples.

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.",2017/08/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-08752-x,7,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000407559100005,,,,,,,0,,1,22

This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ‚Äúconventional‚Äù seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù seed that was not treated with pesticides.

Clothianidin was detected (0.1‚Äì0.8¬†ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96¬†¬±¬†15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127¬†¬±¬†17 workers per hive).

Such crops represent an important source of forage for bees, which is often scarce in agro-ecosystems. However, this benefit has often been overlooked in the design of previous field studies, leaving the net impact of neonicotinoid treated crops on bees relatively unknown. Here, we determine the combined benefit (forage) and cost (insecticide) of oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds on Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera colonies. In April 2014, 36 colonies per species were located adjacent to three large oilseed rape fields (12 colonies per field). Another 36 were in three nearby locations in the same agro-ecosystem, but several kilometers distant from any oilseed rape fields. We found that Bombus colony growth and reproduction were unaffected by location (distant versus adjacent) following the two month flowering period. Apis colony and queen survival were unaffected. However, there was a small, but significant, negative relationship between honey and pollen neonicotinoid contamination and Apis colony weight gain. We hypothesize that any sublethal effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on Bombus colonies are potentially offset by the additional foraging resources provided.

At each site, three locations were directly adjacent to oilseed rape fields and three locations were situated 400 m away from the nearest oilseed rape field. Thus, 96 hives were exposed to fully flowering oilseed rape crops. Colony sizes and weights, the amount of honey harvested, and infection with parasites and diseases were monitored between April and September 2014.

To explore potential colony-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide at field-relevant concentrations, honey bee colonies were fed 5- and 20-ppb concentrations of clothianidin in sugar syrup while control colonies were fed unadulterated syrup. Two experiments were conducted in successive years at the same site in southern Arizona, and one in the high rainfall environment of Mississippi. Across all three experiments, adult bee masses were about 21% lower among colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin than the untreated control group, but no effects of treatment on brood production were observed. Average daily hive weight losses per day in the 5-ppb clothianidin colonies were about 39% lower post-treatment than in the 20-ppb clothianidin colonies, indicating lower consumption and/or better foraging, but the dry weights of newly-emerged adult bees were on average 6‚Äì7% lower in the 5-ppb group compared to the other groups, suggesting a nutritional problem in the 5-ppb group. Internal hive CO2 concentration was higher on average in colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin, which could have resulted from greater CO2 production and/or reduced ventilating activity.

Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

Honey bee colonies were placed in three differently protected maize fields throughout the blooming period, and thereafter they were transferred to a stationary apiary. Samples of pollen loads, bee bread, and adult bees were collected and analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of detection of the analyzed pesticides, a modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used.

Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid Œ≤-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees. ¬©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We related clothianidin exposure and microbial composition to both individual- and colony-level performance parameters, to better understand the direct and indirect mechanistic effects of neonicotinoid exposure on bumblebees.

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2‚Äì3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose.

After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen.

The present article reports the results of laboratory studies (10-d adult and 22-d larval toxicity studies assessing the chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam to adult honey bees and larvae, respectively) and a colony feeding study, with 6 wk of exposure in an area with limited alternative forage, to provide a prewintering colony-level endpoint. The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

160,112,JOUR,Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees,"['Gill, RJ', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, O', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production(1-3). Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.",2012/11/01/,2012,10.1038/nature11585,491,7422,105,U119,0028-0836,WOS:000310434500039,,,,,,,0,,1,40

Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98Œºgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98Œºg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98Œºgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11Œºgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100,1,153,158,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892602774&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2013.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=ec4e0e2e11fd0cfd95e2ea6500fb0294,Scopus,,0,,1,41

Most research to date has investigated the role of pesticides on individual honey bees, and it is still unclear how trace levels of pesticides change colony viability and productivity over seasonal time scales. To address this question we exposed standard bee colonies to chemical stressors known to have negative effects on individual bees, and measured the productivity of bee colonies across a whole year in two environments: near Tucson Arizona and Sydney Australia. We exposed hives to a trace amount of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and to the acaricide thymol, and measured capped brood, bee and honey production, as well as the temperature and foraging force of the colonies. The effect of imidacloprid on colony dynamics differed between the two environments. In Tucson we recorded a positive effect of imidacloprid treatment on bee and brood numbers. Thymol was associated with short-term negative effects on bee numbers at both locations, and may have affected colony survival at one location. The overall benefits of thymol for the colonies were unclear. We conclude that long-term and colony-level measures of the effects of agrochemicals are needed to properly understand risks to bees. ¬© 2019",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.402,677,,660,670,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065063007&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.04.402&partnerID=40&md5=8dcf9b6ef782cb7cba4e8e9f5eae1bd6,Scopus,,0,,1,42

Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems.",2015/12/24/,2015,10.1038/nature16167,528,7583,548,+,0028-0836,WOS:000366991900051,,,,,,,0,,1,43

We studied the effect of the neonicotinoid pesticide clothianidin at field realistic concentrations on small colonies. We found that exposure to clothianidin affected worker jelly production of individual workers and created a strong dose-dependent increase in mortality of individual larvae, but strikingly the population size of capped brood remained stable. Thus, hives exhibited short-term resilience. Using a demographic matrix model, we found that the basis of resilience in dosed colonies was a substantive increase in brood initiation rate to compensate for increased brood mortality. However, computer simulation of full size colonies revealed that the increase in brood initiation led to severe reductions in colony reproduction (swarming) and long-term survival.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions.

Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells, indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior. Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level, only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental effects of clothianidin were observed. Given these findings, neonicotinoid risk needs to be considered independently for each compound and target species. ¬© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep24764,6,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964886747&doi=10.1038%2fsrep24764&partnerID=40&md5=8f1f4a2a435a30867ab553fde21e0693,Scopus,,0,,1,47

During winter, honey bee colonies rely on stored honey and beebread, which is frequently contaminated with the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. To determine whether neonicotinoid exposure affects overwinter survival of Apis mellifera L., we chronically exposed overwintering field colonies and winter workers in the laboratory to thiamethoxam or clothianidin at different concentrations and monitored survival and feed consumption. We also investigated the sublethal effects of chronic thiamethoxam exposure on colony pathogen load, queen quality, and colony temperature regulation. Under field conditions, high doses of thiamethoxam significantly increased overwinter mortality compared to controls, with field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam showing no significant effect on colony overwinter survival. Under laboratory conditions, chronic neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreased survival of winter workers relative to negative control at all doses tested. Chronic high-dose thiamethoxam exposure was not shown to impact pathogen load or queen quality, and field-realistic concentrations of thiamethoxam did not affect colony temperature homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic environmental neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreases survival of winter workers in the laboratory, but only chronic high-dose thiamethoxam significantly decreases overwinter survival of colonies in the field. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

161,369,JOUR,COLONY IMPACT OF PESTICIDE-INDUCED SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON HONEYBEE WORKERS: A SIMULATION STUDY USING BEEHAVE,"['Thorbek, P', 'Campbell, PJ', 'Thompson, HM']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

We report that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies exposed to field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid Imidacloprid grew slower, consumed less food, and produced fewer workers, males and gynes, but unexpectedly produced larger workers compared to control colonies. Behavioural observations show that queens in pesticide-treated colonies spend more time inactive and less time caring for the brood. We suggest that the observed effects on brood body size are driven by a decreased queen ability to manipulate the larva developmental programme.

These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128518,273,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body weight gain', 'Bumblebees', 'comparative study', 'evaluation study', 'Field conditions', 'Field experiment', 'fitness', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Health', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Laboratories', 'laboratory', 'Laboratory conditions', 'Laboratory experiments', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticides', 'reproduction', 'Reproduction', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'thiacloprid', 'worker (insect)']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092790597&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.128518&partnerID=40&md5=fb8a28fcd64a9319bbbfbef71f5b2696,Scopus,,0,,1,56

Colony size is a key ecological trait predicted to drive sensitivity to environmental stressors and may be especially important for species with annual cycles of sociality, such as bumblebees. However, there is limited empirical evidence assessing the effect of colony size on sensitivity to environmental stressors or the mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we examine the relationship between colony size and sensitivity to environmental stressors in bumblebees. We exposed colonies at different developmental stages briefly (2 days) to a common neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and cold stress, while quantifying behaviour of individuals. Combined imidacloprid and cold exposure had stronger effects on both thermoregulatory behaviour and long-term colony growth in small colonies. We find that imidacloprid's effects on behaviour are mediated by body temperature and spatial location within the nest, suggesting that social thermoregulation provides a buffering effect in large colonies. Finally, we demonstrate qualitatively similar effects in size-manipulated microcolonies, suggesting that group size per se, rather than colony age, drives these patterns.

Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context.

The contribution of the neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., clothianidin and imidacloprid) to this decline is controversial, and key to understanding their risk is whether the astonishingly low levels found in the nectar and pollen of plants is sufficient to deliver neuroactive levels to their site of action: the bee brain. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) fed field levels [10 nM, 2.1 ppb (w/w)] of neonicotinoid accumulate between 4 and 10 nM in their brains within 3 days. Acute (minutes) exposure of cultured neurons to 10 nM clothianidin, but not imidacloprid, causes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent rapid mitochondrial depolarization. However, a chronic (2 days) exposure to 1 nM imidacloprid leads to a receptor-dependent increased sensitivity to a normally innocuous level of acetylcholine, which now also causes rapid mitochondrial depolarization in neurons.

Using a highly replicated semi-field study with 56 mesocosms of varying wild plant diversity (2‚Äì16 species) and oilseed rape treated with a neonicotinoid, we tested the interacting effects of resource diversity and insecticides on reproduction of a solitary wild bee. Compared to mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures, availability of resources from wild plants complementing oilseed rape doubled brood cell production. In addition, bee reproduction increased due to plant diversity and identity effects. Exposure to neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape reduced bee larval to adult development by 69%, but only in mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures. Availability of complementary flower resources can thus offset negative effects of neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape on wild bee reproduction.

Previous work has shed new light on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees by uncovering pathways through which neonicotinoids affect bee population dynamics and the potential interactions they have with exogenous stressors. Yet, little is known about whether these effects translate in a field- relevant setting to substantial losses in honey yields for commercial beekeepers. Here, we used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production. Based on production function estimates, we found that sub-lethal concentrations of two widely used neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) detected in the nectar of flowers resulted in substantial losses in honey production for commercial beekeepers in our sample. By simulating a scenario with ideal pathogenic and environmental conditions, we found that the magnitude of the neonicotinoid effects decreases significantly under ideal conditions providing evidence for possible synergies at the field between neonicotinoids and environmental and pathogenic factors. Moreover, in a replicated study with grouped apiaries, we found evidence that the marginal effects of neonicotinoids on honey production vary across apiaries facing different conditions.",2019/04/25/,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0215363,14,4,,,1932-6203,WOS:000465519100021,,,,,,,0,,1,64

The apiaries were selected using spatially stratified random sampling. Colony winter loss data were collected and related to various measures of colony strength recorded in summer, as well as data from laboratory analysis of sample material taken from two selected colonies in each of the 43 apiaries. The logistic regression model which best explained the risk of winter loss included, in order of statistical importance, the variables (1) Varroa destructor mite infestation rate in October 2011, (2) presence of the cyano-substituted neonicotinoids acetamiprid or thiacloprid in the first 2 weeks of August 2011 in at least one of the honey bee matrices honey, bees or bee bread (pollen), (3) presence of Brassica napus (oilseed rape) or Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard) pollen in bee bread in early August 2011, and (4) a measure of the unexplained winter losses for the postal code area where the colonies were located, obtained from a different dataset. We consider in the discussion that reduced opportunities for foraging in July and August because of bad weather may have added substantially to the adverse effects of acetamiprid and thiacloprid. A novel feature of this work is its use of postal code random effects from two other independent datasets collected in the annual national monitoring by questionnaires of winter losses of honey bees in the Netherlands. These were used to plan the sample selection and also in the model fitting of the data in this study.

These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality.

Several parameters were investigated, including mortality, flight activity, and colony development.

We observed several intoxication symptoms 2 h after application, including a high number of moribund bees and dead bees on the first day after application (DAA +1) compared to the control. Adverse effects were observed on the number of open brood cells, with a significant reduction of approximately 22% compared to control over the experimental period.

165,1046,JOUR,The Utility of a Bumble Bee (Bombus spp. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) Brood Test for Evaluating the Effects of Pesticides,"['Krueger, AJ', 'Early, TM', 'Ripperger, RJ', 'Cabrera, AR', 'Schmehl, DR']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Risk assessment for chemicals in the United States relies upon the honey bee (Apis meliffera L. [Hymenoptera: Apidael) as a surrogate for other bee species. There is uncertainty in extrapolating honey bee toxicity data to bumble bees due to differences in life history strategies, food consumption, and nest structure. Here we evaluated the design of a queenless bumble bee microcolony test that could be considered for generating larval toxicity data. Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony. Our data suggest that the microcolony study is only appropriate to assess brood effects to bumble bees for substances with low toxicity to adults, as demonstrated with diflubenzuron.

However, it remains unclear as to which life-history stage is critically affected by exposure. One hypothesis is that sulfoxaflor exposure early in the colony's life cycle can impair larval development, reducing the number of workers produced and ultimately lowering colony reproductive output. Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasiteNosema bombi,following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) orN. bombiexposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor andN. bombiexposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically). Ultimately, our results suggest that colony-level consequences of sulfoxaflor exposure for bumblebees may be mediated through direct effects on larvae. As sulfoxaflor is licensed for use globally, our findings highlight the need to understand how novel insecticides impact non-target insects at various stages of their development.",2020/08/12/,2020,10.1098/rspb.2020.0935,287,1932,,,0962-8452,WOS:000560426700002,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Hexapoda', 'physiology', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'fungus', 'Nosema', 'individual variation', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'sulfoximine', 'parasite', 'larval development', 'growth', 'life cycle', 'host-parasite interaction', 'reproductive biology', 'larval growth', 'life history theory', 'Nosema bombi']",,,,,,0,,1,71

Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 Œºg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 Œºg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 Œºg/L. Overall, acetamiprid delivered in syrup can negatively impact B. impatiens nest development and productivity, however only at concentrations above which would be expected in the environment when used according to label rates.

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 ¬µg/ml to 5 and 1 ¬µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. ¬© 2019 E.

215,716,JOUR,Sulfoxaflor exposure reduces egg laying in bumblebees Bombus terrestris,"['Siviter, H.', 'Horner, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Sulfoximine-based insecticides, such as sulfoxaflor, are of increasing global importance and have been registered for use in 81 countries, offering a potential alternative to neonicotinoid insecticides. Previous studies have demonstrated that sulfoxaflor exposure can have a negative impact on the reproductive output of bumblebee colonies, but the specific life-history variables that underlie these effects remain unknown. Here, we used a microcolony-based protocol to assess the sub-lethal effects of chronic sulfoxaflor exposure on egg laying, larval production, ovary development, sucrose consumption, and mortality in bumblebees. Following a pre-registered design, we exposed colonies to sucrose solutions containing 0, 5, 10 and 250ppb of sulfoxaflor. Exposure at 5¬†ppb has been previously shown to negatively impact colony reproductive success. Our results showed that sulfoxaflor exposure at 5¬†ppb (lowest exposure tested) reduced the number of eggs found within the microcolonies (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.37), with exposed microcolonies also less likely to produce larvae (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.36). Despite this, we found no effect of sulfoxaflor exposure on ovarian development. Sulfoxaflor-exposed bumblebees consumed less sucrose solution, potentially driving the observed reduction in egg laying. Policy implications. Regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are under increasing pressure to consider the potential impact of insecticides on wild bees, such as bumblebees, but sublethal effects can go undetected at lower-tier testing. In identifying just such an effect for bumblebees exposed to sulfoxaflor, this study highlights that microcolony-based protocols are a useful tool that could be implemented within an ecotoxicology framework. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for potentially negative consequences of pollinator exposure to an insecticide that is currently undergoing the licensing process in several EU member states. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

Their development and survival were followed in parallel with control hives (unfed or fed with saccharose syrup) until the end of the following winter. The parameters followed were: adult bee activity (number of bee entering the hive and pollen carrying activity), adult bee population level, capped brood area, frequency of parasitic and other diseases, mortality, number of frames with brood after wintering and a global score of colonies after wintering. The only parameters linked to feeding with imidacloprid-supplemented saccharose syrup when compared with feeding with non-supplemented syrup were: a statistically non-significant higher activity index of adult bees, a significantly higher frequency of pollen carrying during the feeding period and a larger number of capped brood cells. When imidacloprid was no longer applied, activity and pollen carrying were re-established at a similar level for all groups. Repeated feeding with syrup supplemented with imidacloprid did not provoke any immediate or any delayed mortality before, during or following the next winter, whereas such severe effects are described by several French bee keepers as a consequence of imidacloprid use for seed dressing in neighbouring cultures. In any case, during the whole study, mortality was very low in all groups, with no difference between imidacloprid-fed and control colonies. Further research should now address several hypotheses: the troubles described by bee keepers have causes other than imidacloprid; if such troubles are really due to this insecticide, they may only be observed either when bees consume contaminated pollen, when no other sources of food are available, in the presence of synergic factors (that still need to be identified), with some particular races of bees or when colonies are not strong and healthy. ¬© 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005///,2005,10.1002/ps.957,61,2,111,125,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-12244262801&doi=10.1002%2fps.957&partnerID=40&md5=be7454ddad9097857bff1c5edfe9b218,Scopus,,0,,1,75

Poorly known is the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple pesticides, which has high likelihood in agricultural landscapes. Four experiments were conducted to determine if simultaneous exposure to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide Assail¬Æ(30% acetamiprid) and the fungicide Orbit¬Æor Tilt¬Æ(41.8% propiconazole) would cause detrimental effects on survival and colony productivity of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Survival of workers exposed to propiconazole was marginally reduced (Experiment 1), whereas gyne production increased in colonies exposed to acetamiprid (Experiment 2). There was a trend for fewer larvae and workers in colonies exposed to acetamiprid and a mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 3). Higher wax moth infestations and densities were observed in colonies exposed to the mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 4). In conclusion, exposure to the two pesticides resulted in variable outcomes in B. impatiens. Synergy between acetamiprid and propiconazole was explained as an indirect effect of enhanced wax worm infestation. We found an increased level of wax worm infestation in colonies exposed to a mixture of Assail and Tilt compared to colonies not exposed to Assail or Tilt (control) or exposed only to Assail. While this study does not provide evidence that B. impatiens are at high risk when simultaneously exposed to field rates of these two pesticides, we suggest that wild blueberry growers practice integrated pest management as a means of reducing any amount of risk to these important bumble bees. ¬© 2020 South Carolina Entomological Society.

Honey bees have been experiencing high mortality in both the United States and worldwide. Pesticide exposure has been identified as one of the many stressors causing this mortality. Effects of various pesticides have been measured for multiple responses such as learning, memory performance, feeding activity, and thermoregulation. These studies were conducted at many different temperatures (11‚Äì35¬∞C); however, few studies compared toxicity of the same pesticide to bees at different temperatures. It is possible that the same pesticide might show different toxicity to honey bees at different temperatures. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered low doses of two neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) at three different temperature scenarios (35¬∞C, 24¬∞C, and a varying temperature) and determined the effects on honey bee survivorship. We discovered that honey bees are much more sensitive to the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam at a constant 24¬∞C or at a varying temperature (night at 13¬∞C and day at 24¬∞C) compared to bees at 35¬∞C.

Both land-use stressors can have a variety of synergistic and sublethal effects on pollinators, affecting their health and foraging behaviour. Pollinating insects include species with vastly different life histories, giving them potentially different vulnerability and resilience to stressors. However, most research has generally focused on bees. Here, we contrast synergistic effects of nutritional stress and pesticide use on social bumblebees and solitary hoverflies. We experimentally tested the effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid and low-quality food on health traits of Bombus terrestris workers and Episyrphus balteatus adults (ovarian development, body size and colony development or survival). The foraging behaviour of treated pollinators was recorded in a semi-field setup and, for B. terrestris, we measured the pollen amount on the body surface and the pollen deposited on stigmata after a single floral visit. Both stressors affected bumblebee health. Additionally, insecticide-treated workers showed increased flower handling times and flight durations, while low-quality food reduced the amount of pollen on the surface of bumblebees and the pollen deposited on stigmata. Syrphids were mostly affected by low-quality food, which decreased their survival probability and changed their foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we found an interactive effect between the two stressors, reducing E. balteatus ovary development. Synthesis and applications. Insecticide and food stress affected fitness traits of both bumblebees and syrphid flies, possibly reducing pollinator populations under natural conditions. Especially for bumblebees, long-term exposure led to a reduction in the provision of pollination services, both by changing their behaviour and reducing pollen transfer. We found differences between the two pollinator groups, showing that results gained from single groups like bees should not be extrapolated to all pollinators. Interactive effects indicate potential buffering effects of high-quality food against other stressors and highlight the importance of considering synergies between multiple stressors in risk assessments. This further emphasizes the relevance of floral resources such as wild flower strips in agricultural areas to conserve pollinators and pollination services.

One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field.

Increasing evidence suggests that sublethal toxicity of agricultural pesticides affects solitary bees differently than the social bees used to determine regulatory thresholds, such as honey bees and bumblebees. Studies on solitary bees are challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining large numbers of eggs or young larvae for bioassays. Here we show the toxic and sublethal developmental effects of four widely used plant systemic pesticides on the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons). Pollen food stores of this solitary bee were treated with different concentrations of three insecticides (acetamiprid, flonicamid, and sulfoxaflor) and a fungicide (dodine). Eggs were transplanted to the treated pollen and larvae were allowed to feed on the pollen stores after egg hatch. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated pollen were measured until adult eclosion. This year-long study revealed that chronic exposure to all tested pesticides delayed larval development and lowered larval and adult body weights. Additionally, exposure to the systemic fungicide resulted in abnormal larval defecation and increased mortality at the pupal stage, indicating potential risk to bees from fungicide exposure. These findings demonstrate potential threats to solitary bees from systemic insecticides and fungicides and will help in making policy decisions to mitigate these effects. ¬© 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170048,915,,,,,,"['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'Agricultural pesticides', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body weight', 'Chemical contamination', 'controlled study', 'defecation', 'Exposed to', 'female', 'Food crops', 'fungicide', 'Fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'ingestion', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'Larval development', 'long term exposure', 'male', 'mortality', 'nonhuman', 'Orchard bee', 'Orchard bees', 'Orchards', 'Osmia', 'Osmia cornifrons', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'Pollinator', 'pupa', 'pupicidal activity', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Sublethal toxicity', 'survival rate', 'Systemic pesticides', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'Toxicity exposure']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183466833&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.170048&partnerID=40&md5=31920f7b38ffe8eb8f92def45271c3ea,Scopus,,0,,1,81

Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8‚Äì64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24¬†h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering. Our study therefore illustrates the difficulties involved in evaluating the economic/ecological significance of pesticide-induced stress in honey bee field studies. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.06.038,132,,379,389,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976630167&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2016.06.038&partnerID=40&md5=2f3b5b08a2253fcb03155d02fdd42cde,Scopus,,0,,1,82

CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.",2012///,2012,,65,1,99,106,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860796152&partnerID=40&md5=f9c9b22ffdc45b009d4ace2a4ad99f64,Scopus,,0,,1,83

One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.",2019/03/18/,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-39701-5,9,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000461418200001,,,,,,,0,,1,85

Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially ""bee-safe"" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees.",2021/04//undefined,2021,10.3390/insects12040357,12,4,,,2075-4450,WOS:000643078900001,,,,,,,0,,1,87

Bee larvae were exposed to control, low (3 or 6 ppb), intermediate (30 ppb), or high (300 ppb) doses of either imidacloprid or clothianidin in pollen. Field experiments on both bee species involved injecting the pollen provisions with the corresponding pesticide. Only O. lignaria was used for the laboratory experiments, which entailed both injecting the bee's own pollen provisions and replacing the pollen provision with a preblended pollen mixture containing imidacloprid. Larval development, emergence, weight, and mortality were monitored and analyzed. There were no lethal effects found for either imidacloprid or clothianidin on O. lignaria and M. rotundata. Minor sublethal effects were detected on larval development for O. lignaria, with greater developmental time at the intermediate (30 ppb) and high doses (300 ppb) of imidacloprid.

We were successful in creating methodology for pesticide testing on O. lignaria and M. rotundata; however, these methods can be improved upon to create a more robust test.

Mortality was tested in another experiment using exposure at the same concentrations with two differing soil moisture levels (20% and 40%). Nesting activity was reduced by 42% for females exposed at 390 ppb and by 66% for females exposed at 780 ppb. Females treated at 780 ppb produced 40% fewer nest cells per day.

In case pesticide exposure to bees is likely, toxicity tests are performed with honey bees (Apis mellifera), with a tiered approach, for which validated and internationally accepted test protocols exist. However, concerns have grown regarding the protection of non-Apis bees [bumble bees (Bombus spp.), solitary and stingless bees], given their different life cycles and therefore distinct exposure routes. Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient.

Negative impacts are predicted to vary across species of distinct crop fidelity because of the associated consequences for pesticide exposure and dependence on wild flowers. We experimentally established populations of two solitary bee species in apple orchards with distinct pesticide hazard and flower availability in surrounding landscapes. The number of nesting females, their reproduction and offspring survival and parasitism rate were tracked throughout apple bloom. We show that in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta, which showed a strong preference to forage in apple orchards, the number of females remaining at nesting sites towards the end of apple bloom and the overall reproductive success of the released bees declined with pesticide hazard. In contrast, the closely related Osmia bicornis, which showed a lower preference for apple, was not affected by pesticide use in orchards. Floral resource distribution furthermore modulated parasitism rates in both species: while large amounts of locally available resources reduced offspring parasitism, it increased with relatively higher food availability in the landscapes surrounding focal orchards, probably due to the bees foraging on a larger scale and thus longer periods during which nests remained unattended. Our findings provide novel insights into the complex interplay of pesticide exposure, flower availability and parasitism risk driving population dynamics of bees in agroecosystems. They show that in particular the most reliable crop pollinator species are especially harmed by high pesticide use in crops.

Some effects of neonicotinoids are known on bumblebees from temperate climates; however, there are no studies carried out with species from tropical climates, in which there could be different effects since they have different ecological traits. We demonstrated that in a neo-tropical bumblebee, B. ephippiatus, exposed to field-realistic levels of imidacloprid, bee survival, and colony growth, were significantly reduced. The most important conclusion of our study is that tropical bumblebees are affected in a similar way to temperate species. ¬© 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00946-1,53,3,,,,,"['agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus', 'colony', 'imidacloprid', 'nest site', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollution effect', 'survival', 'Toxicology']",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132997056&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-022-00946-1&partnerID=40&md5=4feb0faae88c55927b76abd3e17124b0,Scopus,,0,,1,96
464,610,JOUR,Exposure of Larvae to Sublethal Thiacloprid Delays Bee Development and Affects Transcriptional Responses of Newly Emerged Honey Bees,"['Li, B.', 'Ke, L.', 'Li, A.-R.', 'Diao, Q.-Y.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Liu, Y.-J.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Understanding the cause of honey bee (Apis mellifera) population decline has attracted immense attention worldwide in recent years. Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the most probable factors due to the physiological and behavioral damage they cause to honey bees. However, the influence of thiacloprid, a relatively less toxic cyanogen-substituted form of neonicotinoid, on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) development is not well studied. The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that chronic sublethal thiacloprid can affect honey bee colonies by reducing survival and delaying bee development.

423,197,JOUR,The safety of thiamethoxam to pollinating bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) when applied to tomato plants through drip irrigation.,"['Alarc√≥n, A.L.', 'C√°novas, M.', 'Senn, R.', 'Correia, R.']",Communications in agricultural and applied biological sciences,"Thiamethoxam, mainly sold under the trademark of Actara, is a neonicotinoid widely used in covered vegetables for the control of aphids and whiteflies. In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes, bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed. Based on these results we can conclude that a split application of Actara applied in drip irrigation to the soil/substrate has no effect on the bumble-bees used in tomatoes for pollination.",2005///,2005,,70,4,,,569,579,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745798661&partnerID=40&md5=d8a930dc5880ca2de44efbbf6727867e,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,98
271,29,JOUR,Joint Toxicity of Acetamiprid and Co-Applied Pesticide Adjuvants on Honeybees under Semifield and Laboratory Conditions,"['Chen, L.', 'Yan, Q.', 'Zhang, J.', 'Yuan, S.', 'Liu, X.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The evaluation of adverse effects of pesticides, pesticide adjuvants, and their combination on honeybees is hampered by a lack of colony-level bioassays reflecting productivity and survival over longer term exposure. In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees. Measures should be taken to manage the environmental risk of pesticide adjuvants during the process of formulation development and registration.

230,137,JOUR,Susceptibility of Megachile rotundata to insecticides used in wild blueberry production in Atlantic Canada,"['Gradish, A.E.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.', 'Cutler, G.C.']",Journal of Pest Science,"The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), is a valuable wild and managed pollinator of lowbush blueberry (syn. 'wild blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133,140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,100

Spinosad, which is synthesized from the fermentation process produced by the soil actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, is one of the most used bioinsecticides today. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of spinosad (formulation) on survival, general group activity and the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in two organs (midgut and brain) of workers of Partamona helleri, after 24 h of oral exposure. Workers were orally exposed to different concentrations of spinosad. The concentration (8.16 x 10(-3) mg a.i./mL) that led to the mortality of approximately half the number of treated bees was considered LC50 and was used in behavior, histology and immunofluorescence bioassays. The results revealed that bee survival was substantially reduced with increasing spinosad concentrations. The LC50 of the bioinsecticide compromised general group activity, caused morphological alterations in the midgut and intensified the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in this organ. The brain, on the other hand, did not present significant alterations under the tested conditions. The data obtained demonstrate, therefore, that spinosad negatively affects individual survival, general group activity and the midgut epithelium of P. helleri.",2019/07/15/,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.03.050,175,,148,154,0147-6513,WOS:000464090200017,,,,,,,0,effects on overall group activity,1,101
