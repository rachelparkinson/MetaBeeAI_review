"510,719,JOUR,The impact of pollen quality on the sensitivity of bumblebees to pesticides,""['Barraud, A.', 'Vanderplanck, M.', 'Nadarajah, S.', 'Michez, D.']"",Acta Oecologica,""With 2000 species currently recorded in Europe, bees are a highly diversified and efficient group of pollinating insects. Their decline could therefore lead to a risk for ecosystems functioning and crop yields. The drivers of this decline have been well documented in Europe and involve multiple factors such as pesticides, pathogens, poor nutrition, climate change, and their respective interactions. For pesticides, there is a lack of information concerning the impacts of exposure when the bees have access to pollen diet of different nutritional quality (e.g. variation in sterol and protein content). We performed bioassays on nine groups consisting of 10 Bombus terrestris microcolonies (i.e. queen less colonies) each in a fully crossed experiment including controls without pesticide, two different doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid (2 and 20 Œºg/L) and three pollen diets (i.e. Salix mix, cellulose-diluted Salix mix and cellulose-diluted Salix mix enriched with soy protein). All colonies were fed ad libitum with syrup and pollen. We measured the collection of pollen and syrup, the brood mass and the pollen efficacy (ratio of brood mass/pollen) at the end of the experiment. All these variables were affected by the imidacloprid doses, especially pollen efficacy, which was two and 10 times lower than the control for the 2 and 20 Œºg/L treatments, respectively. As expected, pollen efficacy was also affected by the pollen diet. However, when exposed to imidacloprid, the three different pollen diets did not affect micro-colonies performances. Overall, we show that diet quality does not affect sensitivity to imidacloprid exposure. It seems therefore that the negative effects of imidacloprid exposure cannot be compensated for by a pollen diet of high quality. ¬© 2020"",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103552,105,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084259658&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2020.103552&partnerID=40&md5=a8c642efd52675587a10ca5e1a433a27,Scopus,,1,,1,1";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, with an increased reliance on pesticides to enhance crop production, wild bee communities may inadvertently be affected through exposure to chemical residues. Laboratory and semi-field studies have demonstrated lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on limited genera (e.g., Apis, Bombus, Megachile), yet full field studies evaluating impacts to wild bee communities remain limited. Here, we conducted a two-year field study to assess whether neonicotinoid seed treatment and presence in environmental media (e.g., soil, flowers) influenced bee nest and diet guild abundance and richness. In 2017 and 2018, we planted 23 Missouri agricultural fields to soybeans (Glycine max) using one of three seed treatments: untreated (no insecticide), treated (imidacloprid), or previously-treated (untreated, but neonicotinoid use prior to 2017). During both years, wild bees were collected in study field margins monthly (May to September) in tandem with soil and flowers from fields and field margins that were analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. Insecticide presence in soils and flowers varied over the study with neonicotinoids infrequently detected in both years within margin flowers (0%), soybean flowers (<1%), margin soils (<8%), and field soils (~39%). Wild bee abundance and species richness were not significantly different among field treatments. In contrast, neonicotinoid presence in field soils was associated with significantly lower richness (ground- and aboveground-nesting, diet generalists) of wild bee guilds. Our findings support that soil remains an underexplored route of exposure and long-term persistence of neonicotinoids in field soils may lead to reduced diversity in regional bee communities. Future reduction or elimination of neonicotinoid seed treatment use on areas managed for wildlife may facilitate conservation goals to sustain viable, diverse wild bee populations. ¬© 2021"",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147299,786,,,,,,""['Abundance', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'agriculture', 'Agro-ecosystems', 'agroecosystem', 'Agroecosystems', 'Amino acids', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee functional guild', 'Bee functional guilds', 'Bees', 'chemistry', 'Crops', 'Cultivation', 'Ecosystems', 'Field margins', 'Field studies', 'flower', 'Forestry', 'Glycine max', 'guild', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'long term exposure', 'Megachile', 'Missouri', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitrogen fixation', 'nonhuman', 'plant seed', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'Pollinators', 'priority journal', 'relative abundance', 'Richness', 'seed', 'Seed', 'Seed treatment', 'Seeds', 'soil', 'Soils', 'soybean', 'species richness']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105282479&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.147299&partnerID=40&md5=d30b2e15046c896f8085308414251f63,Scopus,,1,,1,2";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed ‚Äúcarryover‚Äù effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. ¬© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data.

Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies - an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics. ¬© 2017 The Author(s)."",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41559-017-0260-1,1,9,1308,1316,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027489115&doi=10.1038%2fs41559-017-0260-1&partnerID=40&md5=8d50cc8b91f5148c06906693418c5ee6,Scopus,,1,,1,11";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services.

This shows that thiacloprid is not bee-safe if sprayed after anthesis and that spraying has to be conducted at the bud stage to reduce its contamination of nectar and pollen. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research (NIBIO)."",2019///,2019,10.1080/09064710.2019.1596301,69,5,439,451,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063162120&doi=10.1080%2f09064710.2019.1596301&partnerID=40&md5=9ee100ef5b0d34cc86432b5e15e3a602,Scopus,,1,,1,14";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
238,373,JOUR,Neonicotinoids impact bumblebee colony fitness in the field;" a reanalysis of the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency 2012 experiment,""['Goulson, D']"",PEERJ,""The causes of bee declines remain hotly debated, particularly the contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides. In 2013 the UK's Food & Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices. It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids."",2015/03/24/,2015,10.7717/peerj.854,3,,,,2167-8359,WOS:000352297200005,,,,,,,1,,1,15";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While there is evidence suggesting that colony size may play an important role inmitigating neonicotinoid exposure in bees, mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, a recently developed agent-based computational model is used to investigate how the effects of sub-lethal neonicotinoid exposure on intranest behavior of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) are modulated by colony size. Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests.

The long-term risk to honey bee colonies in the field was also investigated, including the sensitive overwintering stage, from four years consecutive single treatment crop exposures to flowering maize and oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds at rates recommended for insect control. Throughout the study, mortality, foraging behavior, colony strength, colony weight, brood development and food storage levels were similar between treatment and control colonies. Detailed examination of brood development throughout the year demonstrated that colonies exposed to the treated crop were able to successfully overwinter and had a similar health status to the control colonies in the following spring.

Many different contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich habitats and nesting sites"; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive pathogens;" exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation, despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony performance. Specifically, both pesticide-treated micro-colonies and those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones.

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects.

Thus, 96 hives were exposed to fully flowering oilseed rape crops. Colony sizes and weights, the amount of honey harvested, and infection with parasites and diseases were monitored between April and September 2014. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen was determined in pollen and honey samples. After oilseed rape flowering, the hives were transferred to an extensive isolated area for post-exposure monitoring.

The honey, which was extracted at the end of the exposure phase, contained 62.0‚Äì83.5 % oilseed rape pollen.

Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation";" however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed.

Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants, and the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees. The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence, particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have been artificially fed neonicotinoids. Thus, the key question is how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in real-world agricultural landscapes. Here we show that a commonly used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the non-systemic pyrethroid Œ≤-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds, reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes, and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild bees may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees. ¬©2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity.

Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98Œºgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98Œºg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98Œºgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11Œºgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam.

Most research to date has investigated the role of pesticides on individual honey bees, and it is still unclear how trace levels of pesticides change colony viability and productivity over seasonal time scales. To address this question we exposed standard bee colonies to chemical stressors known to have negative effects on individual bees, and measured the productivity of bee colonies across a whole year in two environments: near Tucson Arizona and Sydney Australia. We exposed hives to a trace amount of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and to the acaricide thymol, and measured capped brood, bee and honey production, as well as the temperature and foraging force of the colonies. The effect of imidacloprid on colony dynamics differed between the two environments. In Tucson we recorded a positive effect of imidacloprid treatment on bee and brood numbers. Thymol was associated with short-term negative effects on bee numbers at both locations, and may have affected colony survival at one location. The overall benefits of thymol for the colonies were unclear. We conclude that long-term and colony-level measures of the effects of agrochemicals are needed to properly understand risks to bees. ¬© 2019"",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.402,677,,660,670,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065063007&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2019.04.402&partnerID=40&md5=8dcf9b6ef782cb7cba4e8e9f5eae1bd6,Scopus,,0,,1,42";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems."",2015/12/24/,2015,10.1038/nature16167,528,7583,548,+,0028-0836,WOS:000366991900051,,,,,,,0,,1,43";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, hives exhibited short-term resilience. Using a demographic matrix model, we found that the basis of resilience in dosed colonies was a substantive increase in brood initiation rate to compensate for increased brood mortality.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape";" yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions. To help safeguard pollinator health, whole life-cycle fitness assessments, particularly for non-Apis bees, stringently incorporating chronic and sublethal side effects of pesticides, as well as interactions with common natural stressors, such as prevalent parasites, should be considered in the corresponding test guidelines."",2014/04//undefined,2014,10.1111/1365-2664.12188,51,2,450,459,0021-8901,WOS:000332835600018,,,,,,,0,,1,46";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells, indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior. Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level, only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental effects of clothianidin were observed.

In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

However, there have been few in-hive studies on sulfoximines, and the effects on honey bee colony growth and foraging activity are unknown. Here, we calculated the LC50 of Closer¬Æ 24% suspension concentrate (SC) using honey bee foragers then assessed the impacts of chronic exposure of honey bees to a lesser concentration of Closer¬Æ in a semi-field in-hive experiment. To do that, we used a worst-case exposure scenario and fed bees for 21 days with a sublethal and field-relevant concentration of sulfoxaflor (0.3 ppb) which represents the calculated LC5 value of Closer¬Æ. A total of six colonies was assigned to the pesticide or control treatment. Then, we evaluated the colony development and activity as well as the weight and foraging activity of individual foraging bees. We also revealed that sublethal Closer¬Æ exposure impacted honey bee colony growth and activity by reducing bee bread, honey, and brood production, as well as weight and foraging performance of individual bees when colonies were kept under field conditions.

These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd"",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128518,273,,,,,,""['acetamiprid', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body weight gain', 'Bumblebees', 'comparative study', 'evaluation study', 'Field conditions', 'Field experiment', 'fitness', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Health', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Laboratories', 'laboratory', 'Laboratory conditions', 'Laboratory experiments', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticides', 'reproduction', 'Reproduction', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'thiacloprid', 'worker (insect)']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092790597&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.128518&partnerID=40&md5=fb8a28fcd64a9319bbbfbef71f5b2696,Scopus,,0,,1,56";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, there is limited empirical evidence assessing the effect of colony size on sensitivity to environmental stressors or the mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we examine the relationship between colony size and sensitivity to environmental stressors in bumblebees. We exposed colonies at different developmental stages briefly (2 days) to a common neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and cold stress, while quantifying behaviour of individuals. Combined imidacloprid and cold exposure had stronger effects on both thermoregulatory behaviour and long-term colony growth in small colonies. We find that imidacloprid's effects on behaviour are mediated by body temperature and spatial location within the nest, suggesting that social thermoregulation provides a buffering effect in large colonies. Finally, we demonstrate qualitatively similar effects in size-manipulated microcolonies, suggesting that group size per se, rather than colony age, drives these patterns.

Yet, little is known about whether these effects translate in a field- relevant setting to substantial losses in honey yields for commercial beekeepers. Here, we used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production.

The logistic regression model which best explained the risk of winter loss included, in order of statistical importance, the variables (1) Varroa destructor mite infestation rate in October 2011, (2) presence of the cyano-substituted neonicotinoids acetamiprid or thiacloprid in the first 2 weeks of August 2011 in at least one of the honey bee matrices honey, bees or bee bread (pollen), (3) presence of Brassica napus (oilseed rape) or Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard) pollen in bee bread in early August 2011, and (4) a measure of the unexplained winter losses for the postal code area where the colonies were located, obtained from a different dataset.

These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality. Despite this fact, sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproduction, are not mandatorily assessed within the regulatory process.

Tank mixtures are often common practice by farmers, and mostly their effects on honey bees are not routinely assessed. To enable a realistic assessment of laboratory-reported effects of a combination of the insecticide thiacloprid and fungicide prochloraz on honey bees, a large-scale field study with spray application in winter oilseed rape was conducted in four regions in Germany. Several parameters were investigated, including mortality, flight activity, and colony development. Residue analysis of various materials (e.g., dead bees, nectar, and pollen) was conducted to assess exposure level. We observed several intoxication symptoms 2 h after application, including a high number of moribund bees and dead bees on the first day after application (DAA +1) compared to the control. Adverse effects were observed on the number of open brood cells, with a significant reduction of approximately 22% compared to control over the experimental period. High residue concentrations were detected on flowers and dead bees on the day of application, which decreased rapidly within six days. The residue concentrations detected were higher in bee-collected materials than in materials stored in the hive. In conclusion, exposure to a combination containing thiacloprid-prochloraz poses a high risk to honey bees. Thus, the application of such a mixture on flowering crops is restricted in Germany. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137396,313,,,,,,""['aerosol', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'antivirus agent', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee', 'Bees', 'canola', 'controlled study', 'drug intoxication', 'dying', 'Field studies', 'field study', 'Field study', 'flight', 'flower', 'flowering', 'Food products', 'foraging', 'Germany', 'honey', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Large-scale studies', 'mortality', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'nontarget organism', 'Pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'pesticide residue', 'Plant protection products', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'prochloraz', 'Residue', 'residue analysis', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'Spray application', 'Tanks (containers)', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145617351&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.137396&partnerID=40&md5=82ac78771574ed718f43bacc0ea28ad6,Scopus,,0,,1,69";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

[Hymenoptera: Apidael) as a surrogate for other bee species. There is uncertainty in extrapolating honey bee toxicity data to bumble bees due to differences in life history strategies, food consumption, and nest structure. Here we evaluated the design of a queenless bumble bee microcolony test that could be considered for generating larval toxicity data. Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony.

Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasiteNosema bombi,following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) orN. bombiexposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor andN. bombiexposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically).

Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 Œºg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 Œºg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 Œºg/L.

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 ¬µg/ml to 5 and 1 ¬µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. ¬© 2019 E.

Previous studies have demonstrated that sulfoxaflor exposure can have a negative impact on the reproductive output of bumblebee colonies, but the specific life-history variables that underlie these effects remain unknown. Here, we used a microcolony-based protocol to assess the sub-lethal effects of chronic sulfoxaflor exposure on egg laying, larval production, ovary development, sucrose consumption, and mortality in bumblebees. Following a pre-registered design, we exposed colonies to sucrose solutions containing 0, 5, 10 and 250ppb of sulfoxaflor. Exposure at 5¬†ppb has been previously shown to negatively impact colony reproductive success. Our results showed that sulfoxaflor exposure at 5¬†ppb (lowest exposure tested) reduced the number of eggs found within the microcolonies (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.37), with exposed microcolonies also less likely to produce larvae (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.36). Despite this, we found no effect of sulfoxaflor exposure on ovarian development. Sulfoxaflor-exposed bumblebees consumed less sucrose solution, potentially driving the observed reduction in egg laying. Policy implications. Regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are under increasing pressure to consider the potential impact of insecticides on wild bees, such as bumblebees, but sublethal effects can go undetected at lower-tier testing. In identifying just such an effect for bumblebees exposed to sulfoxaflor, this study highlights that microcolony-based protocols are a useful tool that could be implemented within an ecotoxicology framework. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for potentially negative consequences of pollinator exposure to an insecticide that is currently undergoing the licensing process in several EU member states. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

The only parameters linked to feeding with imidacloprid-supplemented saccharose syrup when compared with feeding with non-supplemented syrup were: a statistically non-significant higher activity index of adult bees, a significantly higher frequency of pollen carrying during the feeding period and a larger number of capped brood cells.

Poorly known is the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple pesticides, which has high likelihood in agricultural landscapes. Four experiments were conducted to determine if simultaneous exposure to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide Assail¬Æ(30% acetamiprid) and the fungicide Orbit¬Æor Tilt¬Æ(41.8% propiconazole) would cause detrimental effects on survival and colony productivity of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Survival of workers exposed to propiconazole was marginally reduced (Experiment 1), whereas gyne production increased in colonies exposed to acetamiprid (Experiment 2). There was a trend for fewer larvae and workers in colonies exposed to acetamiprid and a mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 3). Higher wax moth infestations and densities were observed in colonies exposed to the mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 4). In conclusion, exposure to the two pesticides resulted in variable outcomes in B. impatiens. Synergy between acetamiprid and propiconazole was explained as an indirect effect of enhanced wax worm infestation.

Both land-use stressors can have a variety of synergistic and sublethal effects on pollinators, affecting their health and foraging behaviour. Pollinating insects include species with vastly different life histories, giving them potentially different vulnerability and resilience to stressors. However, most research has generally focused on bees. Here, we contrast synergistic effects of nutritional stress and pesticide use on social bumblebees and solitary hoverflies. We experimentally tested the effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid and low-quality food on health traits of Bombus terrestris workers and Episyrphus balteatus adults (ovarian development, body size and colony development or survival). The foraging behaviour of treated pollinators was recorded in a semi-field setup and, for B. terrestris, we measured the pollen amount on the body surface and the pollen deposited on stigmata after a single floral visit. Both stressors affected bumblebee health. Additionally, insecticide-treated workers showed increased flower handling times and flight durations, while low-quality food reduced the amount of pollen on the surface of bumblebees and the pollen deposited on stigmata. Syrphids were mostly affected by low-quality food, which decreased their survival probability and changed their foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we found an interactive effect between the two stressors, reducing E. balteatus ovary development. Synthesis and applications. Insecticide and food stress affected fitness traits of both bumblebees and syrphid flies, possibly reducing pollinator populations under natural conditions. Especially for bumblebees, long-term exposure led to a reduction in the provision of pollination services, both by changing their behaviour and reducing pollen transfer. We found differences between the two pollinator groups, showing that results gained from single groups like bees should not be extrapolated to all pollinators. Interactive effects indicate potential buffering effects of high-quality food against other stressors and highlight the importance of considering synergies between multiple stressors in risk assessments. This further emphasizes the relevance of floral resources such as wild flower strips in agricultural areas to conserve pollinators and pollination services.

Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. ¬© 2023 The Authors"",2023,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168103283&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166097&partnerID=40&md5=71fd9fafbe9b7749bcfa557154545900,,agriculture"; Agriculture; animal experiment; animal parameters; animal tissue; anthropogenic effect; Anthropogenics; Apis; Article; Assessment procedure; bee; Bombus terrestris; Brood development; brood temperature; bumblebee; collective brood care; Collective thermoregulation; colony growth; Colony growth; controlled study; dietary exposure; flupyradifurone; glyphosate; herbicide; Herbicides; insecticide; Insecticides; Microcolonies; Mortality rate; nonhuman; organism colony; Parasite-; pesticide; Pesticides; Pollinator crisis; risk assessment; Risk assessment; Risks assessments; temperature; thermoregulation; unclassified drug,,,,0,,1,80;;;;;;;;;;;

Increasing evidence suggests that sublethal toxicity of agricultural pesticides affects solitary bees differently than the social bees used to determine regulatory thresholds, such as honey bees and bumblebees. Studies on solitary bees are challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining large numbers of eggs or young larvae for bioassays. Here we show the toxic and sublethal developmental effects of four widely used plant systemic pesticides on the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons). Pollen food stores of this solitary bee were treated with different concentrations of three insecticides (acetamiprid, flonicamid, and sulfoxaflor) and a fungicide (dodine). Eggs were transplanted to the treated pollen and larvae were allowed to feed on the pollen stores after egg hatch. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated pollen were measured until adult eclosion. This year-long study revealed that chronic exposure to all tested pesticides delayed larval development and lowered larval and adult body weights. Additionally, exposure to the systemic fungicide resulted in abnormal larval defecation and increased mortality at the pupal stage, indicating potential risk to bees from fungicide exposure. These findings demonstrate potential threats to solitary bees from systemic insecticides and fungicides and will help in making policy decisions to mitigate these effects. ¬© 2024 Elsevier B.V."",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170048,915,,,,,,""['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'Agricultural pesticides', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body weight', 'Chemical contamination', 'controlled study', 'defecation', 'Exposed to', 'female', 'Food crops', 'fungicide', 'Fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'ingestion', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'Larval development', 'long term exposure', 'male', 'mortality', 'nonhuman', 'Orchard bee', 'Orchard bees', 'Orchards', 'Osmia', 'Osmia cornifrons', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'Pollinator', 'pupa', 'pupicidal activity', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Sublethal toxicity', 'survival rate', 'Systemic pesticides', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'Toxicity exposure']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183466833&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.170048&partnerID=40&md5=31920f7b38ffe8eb8f92def45271c3ea,Scopus,,0,,1,81";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8‚Äì64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24¬†h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering.

CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies."",2012///,2012,,65,1,99,106,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860796152&partnerID=40&md5=f9c9b22ffdc45b009d4ace2a4ad99f64,Scopus,,0,,1,83";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments.

Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially """"bee-safe"""" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees."",2021/04//undefined,2021,10.3390/insects12040357,12,4,,,2075-4450,WOS:000643078900001,,,,,,,0,,1,87";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient. In addition, new insights needed to develop a standardized test protocol were acquired, such as testing of a positive control for the first time and selection of male and female individuals at egg level. ¬© 2021 The Authors"",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112143,215,,,,,,""['adult', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus (genus)', 'cocoon', 'cocoon weight', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'Cornuta', 'developmental mortality', 'dose-response relationship', 'drug effect', 'embryo', 'environment', 'exposure', 'female', 'Female', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'larval development time', 'Lethal endpoints', 'lethality', 'life cycle stage', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'longevity', 'male', 'Megachilidae', 'Meliponinae', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Oral test protocol', 'Osmia', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia cornuta', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'pollen provision consumption', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Solitary bee larvae', 'standardization', 'Sublethal endpoints', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity Tests', 'validation study', 'weight', 'winter']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102581767&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112143&partnerID=40&md5=0b628199b435a536f1bf9d7479f980a8,Scopus,,0,Effects on sublethal endpoints in solitary bee,1,93";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here, we used semi-field experiments to investigate the potential impact of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on the sex ratio of the closely related species Osmia cornuta. Male and female individuals of O. cornuta were held in flight cages with fully blooming winter oilseed rape, treated or not with clothianidin.

A total of 191 male and 4 female, and 203 male and 2 female O. cornuta emerged in the control and the clothianidin treatment, respectively, thereby clearly showing an extremely male-biased sex ratio. However, there was no significant clothianidin treatment effect.

Negative impacts are predicted to vary across species of distinct crop fidelity because of the associated consequences for pesticide exposure and dependence on wild flowers. We experimentally established populations of two solitary bee species in apple orchards with distinct pesticide hazard and flower availability in surrounding landscapes. The number of nesting females, their reproduction and offspring survival and parasitism rate were tracked throughout apple bloom. We show that in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta, which showed a strong preference to forage in apple orchards, the number of females remaining at nesting sites towards the end of apple bloom and the overall reproductive success of the released bees declined with pesticide hazard. In contrast, the closely related Osmia bicornis, which showed a lower preference for apple, was not affected by pesticide use in orchards. Floral resource distribution furthermore modulated parasitism rates in both species: while large amounts of locally available resources reduced offspring parasitism, it increased with relatively higher food availability in the landscapes surrounding focal orchards, probably due to the bees foraging on a larger scale and thus longer periods during which nests remained unattended. Our findings provide novel insights into the complex interplay of pesticide exposure, flower availability and parasitism risk driving population dynamics of bees in agroecosystems. They show that in particular the most reliable crop pollinator species are especially harmed by high pesticide use in crops. Our study underpins the key role of reducing pesticide risks for pollinators through effective regulation of potentially hazardous agrochemicals and the promotion of alternative pest regulation approaches along with conserving and restoring flower-rich habitats to sustain pollinator populations in agroecosystems."",2024/04/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171058,922,,,,0048-9697,WOS:001300718300001,,,,,,,0,,1,95";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the most probable factors due to the physiological and behavioral damage they cause to honey bees. However, the influence of thiacloprid, a relatively less toxic cyanogen-substituted form of neonicotinoid, on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) development is not well studied. The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway.

In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves"; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees.

Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment.

To quantify pesticide residues in pollinator plantings, we sampled flowers and soil from pollinator plantings and compared them to samples from unenhanced field margins and crop row middles. At conventionally managed farms, flowers from pollinator plantings had similar exposure profiles to those from unenhanced field margins or crop row middles, with multiple pesticides and high and similar risk quotient (RQ) values (with pollinator planting RQ: 3.9"; without pollinator planting RQ: 4.0).

Risk was lower at sites where there was no pesticide activity (RQ: 0.3), but again there was no significant difference between management types.

Neonicotinoids are the most commonly used insecticide globally, but restrictions on their use and rising pest resistance have increased the demand for alternative pesticides. Flupyradifurone is a novel insecticide that has been licenced globally for use on bee-visited crops. Here, in a semi-field experiment, we exposed solitary bees (Osmia lignaria) to a commercial pesticide formulation (Sivanto Prime) containing flupyradifurone at label-recommended rates. We originally designed the experiment to examine sublethal effects, but contrary to our expectations, 100 % of bees released into pesticide-treated cages died within 3 days of exposure, compared to 0 % in control plots. Bees exposed to flupyradifurone a few days after the initial application survived but endured prolonged sublethal effects, including lower nesting success, impairment to foraging efficiency, and higher mortality. These results demonstrate that exposure to this novel insecticide poses significant threats to solitary bees and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that this pesticide can have negative impacts on wild bees at field-realistic concentrations.

However, these bees may be exposed to pesticides during foraging, which can affect both individuals and their colonies. One example comes from the use of pyraclostrobin (a fungicide) and thiamethoxam (an insecticide) for pest control in pepper crops, which F. varia visits. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined sublethal effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) (0.000543 ng a.i./¬µL) and pyraclostrobin (PYR) (1.5 ng i.a./¬µL) on the morphology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of F. varia workers. Results showed that both pesticides, regardless of the exposure time (through feeding during 48 h or 96 h), disturbed the morphology of the analyzed organs. Specifically, F. varia exposed orally to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin, either alone or in combination, exhibited a higher rate of damage to the midgut (e.g., vacuolization, apocrine secretion, and cellular elimination) compared to the bees in the control groups, both after 48 h and 96 h of exposure. In Malpighian tubules, vacuolation is the only damage present. As the observed morphological alterations likely compromise the excretion and absorption functions, exposure to pyraclostrobin and thiamethoxam may lead to disturbances at both the individual and colony levels. These results highlight the urgent need for a future reassessment of the safety of fungicides and insecticides regarding their potential effects on bee populations. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024."",2024///,2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02786-4,33,8,875,883,,,""['absorption', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'apocrine gland', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'cell vacuole', 'controlled study', 'digestive system disease', 'drug effect', 'excretion', 'exposure', 'feeding', 'foraging behavior', 'Frieseomelitta varia', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Malpighian tubule', 'Malpighian Tubules', 'midgut', 'Morphological damages', 'morphology', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'neotropical bee', 'Neotropical bees', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides mixtures', 'physiology', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'pyrachlostrobin', 'pyraclostrobin', 'stingless bee', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'strobirulin', 'Strobirulin', 'sublethal concentration', 'sublethal effect', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'time', 'unclassified drug', 'worker (insect)', 'Worker bee']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198358059&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-024-02786-4&partnerID=40&md5=ff6ad40cd9da9997ffce27d0367ee700,Scopus,,1,,0,107";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The aim of this study was to evaluate larval survival, reproductive fitness, and histopathology of honey bee queens exposed to incremental doses (0, 5, 50 ng) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (THI) applied directly to individual late larvae (7 days post-oviposition) of queens. The 5 ng dose represents a calculated high environmental level of exposure for honey bee queen larvae. Morphometric evaluation revealed that the total area of mandibular gland epithelium in queens exposed to 5 and 50 ng THI was reduced by 14% (P =.12) and 25% (P =.001), respectively. Decreased mandibular gland size may alter pheromone production, which could in part explain previously observed negative effects of THI on the reproductive fitness of queens.

CpTI (Cowpea Trypsin Inhibitor) cotton cultivar CCRI41 is increasingly used in China and potential side effects on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. have been documented recently. Two studies have assessed potential lethal and sublethal effects in young bees fed with CCRI41 cotton pollen but no effect was observed on learning capacities, although lower feeding activity in exposed honey bees was noted (antifeedant effect). The present study aimed at providing further insights into potential side effects of CCRI41 cotton on honey bees. Emerging honey bees were exposed to different pollen diets using no-choice feeding protocols (chronic exposure) in controlled laboratory conditions and we aimed at documenting potential mechanisms underneath the CCRI41 antifeedant effect previously reported. Activity of midgut proteolytic enzyme of young adult honey bees fed on CCRI41 cotton pollen were not significantly affected, i.e. previously observed antifeedant effect was not linked to disturbed activity of the proteolytic enzymes in bees' midgut. Hypopharyngeal gland development was assessed by quantifying total extractable proteins from the glands. Results suggested that CCRI41 cotton pollen carries no risk to hypopharyngeal gland development of young adult honey bees. In the two bioassays, honey bees exposed to 1 % soybean trypsin inhibitor were used as positive controls for both midgut proteolytic enzymes and hypopharyngeal gland proteins quantification, and bees exposed to 48 ppb (part per billion) (i.e. 48 ng g -1) imidacloprid were used as controls for exposure to a sublethal concentration of toxic product. The results show that the previously reported antifeedant effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees is not linked to effects on their midgut proteolytic enzymes or on the development of their hypopharyngeal glands.

The majority of studies examining the effect of neonicotinoids on bees have focussed on social species, namely honey bees and bumble bees. However, most bee species are solitary, their life histories differing considerably from these social species, and thus it is possible that their susceptibility to pesticides may be quite different. Studies that have included solitary bees have produced mixed results regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on survival and reproductive success. While the majority of studies have focused on the effects of adult exposure, bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here we examined the effect of exposure of Osmia bicornis larvae to a range of field-realistic concentrations (0-10 ppb) of the neonicotinoid clothianidin, observing no effect on larval development time, overwintering survival or adult weight. Flow-through respirometry was used to test for latent effects of larval exposure on adult physiological function.

However, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using an established semi-field experimental set-up and Osmia cornuta as a solitary bee model, we examined the effects of field-realistic concentrations of a common neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin) on male larvae and adults. Besides measuring lethal (i.e., overwintering success and adult survival) and sub-lethal endpoints (i.e., emergence mass and emergence duration), we examined, for the first time, potential effects on the male reproductive physiology of a solitary bee (i.e., sperm quantity and viability). The data revealed no significant effects on any of the measured response variables. This may be due to the low degree of clothianidin exposure (0.56 ng g‚àí1) and/or the apparent low susceptibility of solitary bee larvae to neonicotinoids. Furthermore, it is conceivable that ideal foraging conditions, combined with optimal weather and lack of other environmental stressors, may have improved the ability of bees to cope with the insecticide. To reliably assess and understand the environmental hazards of agrochemicals, a holistic approach, including laboratory, semi-field and field data is required.

Sulfoxaflor is a new systemic insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agro-environments, bees can be exposed to this compound via contaminated pollen and nectar for long periods of time. Therefore, it is important to assess the potential effects of chronic exposure to sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with fungicides, on pollinators. In this study, we tested the effects of chronic exposure to two field concentrations of sulfoxaflor (20 and 100 ppb) alone and in combination with four concentrations of the fungicide fluxapyroxad (7500, 15,000, 30,000 and 60,000 ppb) on syrup consumption and longevity in females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. Exposure to 20 ppb of sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with the fungicide, stimulated syrup consumption, but did not affect longevity. In contrast, syrup consumption decreased in bees exposed to 100 ppb, all of which died after 2‚Äì6 days of exposure. We found no evidence of synergism between the two compounds at any of the two sulfoxaflor concentrations tested. Comparison of our findings with the literature, confirms that O. bicornis is more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than honey bees.

But it can be disrupted by pesticides and in-hive chemicals, putting honey bee health in danger. We used a controlled and fully crossed laboratory experimental design to test the effects of a 10-day period of chronic exposure to field-realistic sublethal concentrations of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), namely flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (Sulf), and a fungicide, azoxystrobin (Azoxy), individually and in combination, on the survival of individual honey bee workers and the composition of their gut microbiota (fungal and bacterial diversity). Metabarcoding was used to examine the gut microbiota on days 0, 5, and 10 of pesticide exposure to determine how the microbial response varies over time";" to do so, the fungal ITS2 fragment and the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA were targeted. We found that FPF has a negative impact on honey bee survival, but interactive (additive or synergistic) effects between either insecticide and the fungicide on honey bee survival were not statistically significant. Pesticide treatments significantly impacted the microbial community composition. The fungicide Azoxy substantially reduced the Shannon diversity of fungi after chronic exposure for 10 days. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of the bee gut microbiota was also differentially affected by the fungicide, insecticides, and fungicide-insecticide combinations. Gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Serratia spp. (e.g. S. marcescens), which can have devastating consequences for host health such as increased susceptibility to infection and reduced lifespan. Our findings raise concerns about the long-term impact of novel nACHR insecticides, particularly FPF, on pollinator health and recommend a novel methodology for a refined risk assessment that includes the potential effects of agrochemicals on the gut microbiome of bees. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V."",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157941,849,,,,,,""['4-Butyrolactone', 'additive effect', 'adult', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'Azoxystrobin', 'bacterial RNA', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Chronic exposure', 'concentration (composition)', 'controlled study', 'DNA barcoding', 'dysbiosis', 'Dysbiosis', 'experimental design', 'flupyradifurone', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'genus', 'Gut microbiota', 'Health risks', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'infection sensitivity', 'infectious agent', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'internal transcribed spacer 2', 'intestine flora', 'lifespan', 'long term exposure', 'microbial community', 'microbial diversity', 'microbiology', 'Microbiome', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'nontarget organism', 'pathogen', 'Pathogen', 'Pathogens', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator decline', 'population abundance', 'population decline', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'relative abundance', 'Relative abundance', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'RNA', 'RNA 16S', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Serratia marcescens', 'Shannon index', 'species composition', 'stomach content', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'sublethal concentration', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'synergistic effect', 'Synergistic effect', 'unclassified drug', 'worker (insect)', 'yeast', 'Yeast']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135966632&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157941&partnerID=40&md5=7c8c3760f1611476c8dee50665616ace,Scopus,,1,,0,118";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control, 0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg-1, during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment. At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild (0.2-0.8 mg kg-1) we detected minimal negative effects to bumble bee colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at 8.0 mg kg-1 spinosad, about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a 'worst case' field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg-1 were slower foragers on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad treated colonies.

Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites.

Such effects can be direct effects from insecticide exposure, but neonicotinoids can affect plant physiology, and effects could therefore also be indirectly mediated by changes in plant phenology, attractiveness and nutritional value. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we tested if seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affected oilseed rape‚Äôs production of flower resources for bees and the content of the secondary plant products glucosinolates that provide defense against herbivores. Additionally, we tested if seed treatment affected the attractiveness of oilseed rape to flower visiting bumblebees, using outdoor mesocosms. Flowers and leaves of clothianidin-treated plants had different profiles of glucosinolates compared with untreated plants. Bumblebees in mesocosms foraged slightly more on untreated plants. Neither flower timing, flower size nor the production of pollen and nectar differed between treatments, and therefore cannot explain any preference for untreated oilseed rape. We instead propose that this small but significant preference for untreated plants was related to the altered glucosinolate profile caused by clothianidin.

This restriction did allow for the continued use of these seed treatments, in particular clothianidin, on non-flowering crops like winter wheat. To determine the impacts of the moratorium, we assessed neonicotinoid concentrations pre- (2014) and post- (2015‚àí17) moratorium in 347 honey samples collected across Great Britain. While the probability of detecting clothianidin declined immediately following the moratorium, detection rates remained constant over the following three years (mean = 0.10 ppb, maximum = 2.8 ppb). In contrast, after three years thiamethoxam residues entirely disappeared while detection of imidacloprid was infrequent but persistent over the whole period. For those hives where neonicotinoids were detected, there was no evidence that the concentrations in the honey declined over the three years following the ban. Using metabarcoding approaches, we identified plants foraged upon by honeybees during the production of honey. After the moratorium came into effect, the highest neonicotinoid residues were associated with honey produced by foraging on both oilseed rape and several wild plants found in arable field margins. Concerns about soil persistence and uptake by non-target flowering plants ultimately led to a full European Union ban in 2018. Our results suggest that before this full ban came into effect, the use of clothianidin on non-flowering crops maintained a low-level probability of encountering this neonicotinoid within honey. However, these concentrations were low and would have been unlikely to pose significant risks to honeybees. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V."",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107205,308,,,,,,""['Apis mellifera', 'Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris', 'Brassica napus', 'clothianidin', 'Clothianidin', 'EU moratorium', 'European Union', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Magnoliophyta', 'Metabarcoding', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'sugar beet', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'United Kingdom']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097174852&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2020.107205&partnerID=40&md5=8f6a347f2b07a12f343674e475f6b35c,Scopus,,0,Neonicotinoid concentrations in honey samples ,0,128";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the evidences against neonicotinoids are inconclusive. In this study, we assessed the impact of neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam), when applied as seed treatment and foliar sprays, on the foraging activity of honey bees. When applied as seed treatment, residues of the tested molecules in the pollen and nectar samples were present below quantifiable levels (< LOQ). At 3 days after spraying, residues of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were 0.86 and 0.96 mg/kg in the leaf samples, 0.15 and 0.23 mg/kg in the pollen samples, and 0.07 and 0.07 mg/kg in the nectar samples, respectively. Further, the foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment. Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application. Nonetheless, the foraging activity was comparable to the control levels 7 days after spraying.

In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73. nanogram/gram (ng/g).

One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 Œºg/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance.

A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure.

Pesticide exposure and pathogens may interact to have strong negative effects on managed honey bee colonies. Such findings are of great concern given the large numbers and high levels of pesticides found in honey bee colonies. Thus it is crucial to determine how field-relevant combinations and loads of pesticides affect bee health. We collected pollen from bee hives in seven major crops to determine 1) what types of pesticides bees are exposed to when rented for pollination of various crops and 2) how field-relevant pesticide blends affect bees' susceptibility to the gut parasite Nosema ceranae. Our samples represent pollen collected by foragers for use by the colony, and do not necessarily indicate foragers' roles as pollinators. In blueberry, cranberry, cucumber, pumpkin and watermelon bees collected pollen almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers during our sampling. Thus more attention must be paid to how honey bees are exposed to pesticides outside of the field in which they are placed. We detected 35 different pesticides in the sampled pollen, and found high fungicide loads. The insecticides esfenvalerate and phosmet were at a concentration higher than their median lethal dose in at least one pollen sample. While fungicides are typically seen as fairly safe for honey bees, we found an increased probability of Nosema infection in bees that consumed pollen with a higher fungicide load.

"98,529,JOUR,""Neonicotinoid pesticide applications affect pollinator abundance and visitation, leading to implications for sunflower production (Helianthus annuus L.)"",""['Saleem, M.S.', 'Akbar, M.F.', 'Javed, M.A.', 'Sultan, A.']"",Cogent Food and Agriculture,""Pesticides are considered a risk to pollinators";" however, little is known about the possible effects of their injudicious use on pollinators, including the ecosystem services provided to crops and wildflowers. Recently, great attention has been paid to the effects of neonicotinoids pesticides on pollinators and their potential role in harming the health of bees all over the world. Sunflowers, being self-incompatible plants, rely on insects, primarily bees, for effective cross-pollination and successful seed-set. Ensuring the presence of sufficient pollinators in the field is crucial for facilitating pollen movement between flowers and promoting optimal seed development. However, the reliance on insect-mediated cross-pollination also makes sunflowers susceptible to pest attacks, which can negatively impact seed production. To mitigate these potential threats and achieve increased seed yields, careful consideration is given to the judicious use of pesticides. Striking the right balance between providing adequate pollinators and implementing appropriate pest management strategies is vital for maximizing sunflower crop productivity. To reveal such potential impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides, we undergo the current study that aimed to estimate flower visitation and pollination in a sunflower crop by applying three neonicotinoid insecticides i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, including the control group for two years i.e. 2020, and 2021. In all experimental plots, we quantified floral visitors for fourteen days at three different times (8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm). Floral visitors were divided into three groups, Apis bees, Non-Apis bees, and butterflies. After the maturation period, the achenes from each capitulum were separated and brought for weight. We discovered that this study confirmed the adverse effect of neonicotinoids pesticides on sunflower production. Our research revealed that the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam had a negative impact on the visitation of Apis bees, with reductions of 19%, 18.5%, and 23% respectively, as compared to the control group during the year 2020. Furthermore, these pesticides also caused a decrease in the visitation of Non-Apis bees by 15%, 15%, and 17% respectively. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 17.4%, 14.6%, and 15.8% for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam respectively. Based on our research conducted in the year 2021, the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam caused a reduction of 22.5%, 24%, and 25.5% respectively in the visitation of Apis bees, as compared to the control group. Similarly, non-Apis bees experienced a decrease in visitation by 19.5%, 23.5%, and 25% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 18.2%, 22.2%, and 26% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the use of these pesticides affected the diversity of floral visitors and contributed to a decline in the number of fruit during the year 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the abundance of floral visitors, the mass of fruits, and the quantity of oil in the seeds were significantly lower after treatment with neonicotinoid pesticides, thus evidencing its negative effect on sunflower productivity.

While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle.

A decrease in pollinator populations can therefore have severe consequences for both natural ecosystems and agricultural yields. Pesticide usage has been pointed out as one of the drivers behind pollinator declines. Globally, neonicotinoids are one of the most commonly used insecticides and studies have shown that exposure at sublethal levels can alter foraging behaviour, ultimately negatively affecting survival. Using a custom-made bumblebee colony monitoring system, we examined how the number and duration of foraging bouts of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) on an individual level was affected by exposure to low (6.5 Œºg/L) and high (10.2 Œºg/L) sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin via nectar. We also examined possible interaction between clothianidin exposure and abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and its impact on foraging bout number and duration. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of clothianidin increased foraging bout duration in bumblebees. Furthermore, the foraging bout duration decreased with increasing temperature at both exposure concentrations, whereas the unexposed control group was not affected by temperature. Neither number of foraging bouts nor the daily rhythm of foraging bout duration was affected by clothianidin exposure or temperature. The foraging bout duration decreased with increasing precipitation in both exposed and non-exposed groups. However, we did not find any interaction between precipitation and exposure, suggesting that precipitation does not affect toxicity. Our study shows the importance of semi-natural experiments and accounting for ambient factors when assessing the risk that pesticide exposure may present to pollinators. We conclude that the effect of clothianidin exposure on bumblebee foraging behaviour is temperature sensitive and that local climatic conditions and future climate change scenarios should be considered in risk assessments of clothianidin and other insecticides. ¬© 2021 Journal of Pollination Ecology.

Although evidence suggests that exposure to insecticides can affect bees, most pesticide research and risk assessment has focussed on social bees and mortality while solitary species are understudied. The ability to forage is critical for solitary bee reproduction, also in how they deliver pollination services, and we know little about how insecticides can impact these behaviours. We exposed solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to field realistic levels of two widely used insecticides with differing modes of action (lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (neonicotinoid)), in a semi-field setting over multiple rounds of exposure. We then tested impacts on bee behaviour and pollination in apples, an important global insect-pollinated crop. Pollination by insecticide-treated bees reduced apple production by up to 86 % depending on the compound and the number of exposures, but the underlying mechanism behind this remains unclear and should be investigated further. Other measurements of pollination services including number of seeds per apple and stigma pollen deposition showed no relationship with pesticide treatment. Bee foraging behaviour was also affected by treatment where both insecticides appear to induce an excitatory effect which was constant for acetamiprid and eventually ceased for lambda-cyhalothrin after multiple exposures. This suggests that both neonicotinoid and non‚Äëneonicotinoid insecticides can potentially affect behaviour and pollination services of solitary bees depending on how often they are exposed, which is particularly important given the changing usage patterns of these compound classes based on regulations around their use. This highlights the importance of moving insecticide risk assessment towards more field realistic scenarios and including sublethal effects on solitary and social bees, in addition to considering repeated exposures of bees to pesticides as is realistic in the field. ¬© 2023 The Authors"",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164399,894,,,,,,""['acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'aerosol', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'apple', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee pollination', 'Bees', 'Cell proliferation', 'controlled study', 'crop yield', 'Crop yield', 'Crops', 'cyhalothrin', 'exposure', 'female', 'field study', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Fruits', 'harvest', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lambda-cyhalothrin', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicorni', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pistil stigma', 'plant seed', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'Pyrethroid insecticide', 'pyrethroid pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk perception', 'Risks assessments', 'Service delivery', 'sublethal effect']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163847851&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.164399&partnerID=40&md5=0111f5e09432e383a1d7717e1469527d,Scopus,,0,tested impacts of neonic and pyrethroid exposure on bee behaviour and pollination in apples,0,145";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Traditionally, most laboratory studies on bee ecotoxicology test acute exposure to single compounds. However, under field conditions, bees are often chronically exposed to a variety of chemicals, with potential synergistic effects. We studied the effects of field-realistic concentrations of three pesticides measured in pollen and nectar of commercial melon fields on the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We orally exposed females of this species throughout their life span to 8 treatments combining two neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid) and a triazole fungicide (myclobutanil) via pollen and sugar syrup. We measured pollen and syrup consumption, longevity, ovary maturation and thermogenesis. Pesticide intake was three orders of magnitude higher via syrup than pollen. At the tested concentrations, no synergistic effects emerged, and we found no effects on longevity and ovary maturation. However, all treatments containing imidacloprid resulted in suppressed syrup consumption and drastic decreases in thoracic temperature and bee activity. Our results have important implications for pesticide regulation. If we had measured only lethal effects we would have wrongly concluded that the pesticide combinations containing imidacloprid were safe to O. bicornis. The incorporation of tests specifically intended to detect sublethal effects in bee risk assessment schemes should be an urgent priority.

As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm.

Additionally, reduced access to forage in agricultural areas creates the potential for risk interactions with these pesticides in regions critical for honey production. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient access to pollen during larval development could mitigate stress associated with oral clothianidin exposure in honey bee adults. An apiary was established where pollen traps deprived half of the colonies of pollen, which was then supplemented to the others. Adults were fed 0, 10, 40, 200, or 400 ¬µg/L clothianidin in the laboratory, and larval and adult lipids and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared between feeding treatments. Survival at sublethal concentrations of clothianidin was significantly reduced for adult bees reared in pollen deprived colonies. Adult SOD activity was affected by clothianidin dose but not larval feeding treatment, though within the pollen-deprived cohort, SOD was greater in controls than those fed clothianidin. Larval SOD differed between field replicates, with supplemented colonies having slightly higher activity levels during a period of pollen dearth, indicating that supplementation during these periods is particularly important for mitigating oxidative stress within the hive. Larval lipids were significantly higher in supplemented colonies during a substantial pollen flow, though adult lipids were unaffected by feeding treatment. These results suggest that during periods of pollen dearth, oxidative stress and adult worker longevity will be improved by supplementing colonies with locally collected pollen. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

Among others, the risk of exposure is high for bumblebee (Bombus spp.) queens hibernating in agricultural soils. An important question is whether bumblebee queens can detect and avoid pesticide-contaminated soils, or whether they might be attracted to such agrochemical residues. To address this question, we performed a multiple-choice preference experiment in which newly emerged bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens were given access to arrays of 36 crates of soil treated with different pesticides in large mesh-covered enclosures. Five of the most commonly encountered pesticides in agricultural soils (boscalid, chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, cyantraniliprole, difenoconazole) were selected for testing at two contamination levels (lower or higher), based on field-realistic exposure estimates. Bumblebee queens consistently avoided hibernating in pesticide-free soil at both contamination levels, while showing no avoidance for any pesticide-treated soil types. At the lower contamination level, queens selected the pesticide-free soil 1.3 to 2.4-fold less frequently on average than any of the spiked soils, while none of the queens from the higher contamination group selected pesticide-free soil. This apparent preference for pesticide-contaminated soils increases the likelihood of exposure to and potential hazard from pesticide residues in soil for bumblebee queens during hibernation, a critical and highly vulnerable period of their annual life cycle. ¬© 2024 The Authors"",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176534,954,,,,,,""['agricultural land', 'agricultural soil', 'Anthropogenic', 'Article', 'Avoidance', 'avoidance behavior', 'bee', 'Behavioral effects', 'behavioral response', 'Behavioural effect', 'Bumble bee', 'bumblebee', 'clothianidin', 'difenoconazole', 'Ecological trap', 'environmental factor', 'hibernation', 'landscape', 'life cycle', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'maximum concentration', 'Multiple choice', 'Multiple-choice preference', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'overwintering', 'Overwintering', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticide exposure', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollution effect', 'pollution exposure', 'Preference', 'preference behavior', 'Risk assessment', 'soil pollution', 'Soil pollution', 'Solidago', 'substrate', 'temperature', 'vulnerability']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205338389&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.176534&partnerID=40&md5=79a36f4ceb1353b863a14c6e8815a1f7,Scopus,,0,,0,152";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In both experiments, the neonicotinoid decreased the temperature of bees the day following the exposure. After a cold shock (5¬†min at 4¬†¬∞C), the two higher doses elicited a decrease of the thorax temperature, while the lower dose caused an increase, compared to the control. These alterations in thermoregulation caused by thiamethoxam may affect bee foraging activity and a variety of in-hive tasks, likely leading to negative consequences at the colony level.

Interspecific variation in wild bee response to pesticide exposure is expected to be related to variation in their morphology, physiology, and ecology, though there are still important knowledge gaps in its understanding. Pesticide risk assessments have largely focussed on the Western honey bee sensitivity considering it protective enough for wild bees. Recently, guidelines for Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis testing have been developed but are not yet implemented at a global scale in pesticide risk assessments. Here, we developed and tested a new simplified method of pesticide exposure on wild bee species collected from the field in Belgium. Enough specimens of nine species survived in a laboratory setting and were exposed to oral and topical acute doses of a sulfoximine insecticide. Our results confirm significant variability among wild bee species. We show that Osmia cornuta is more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than B. terrestris, whereas Bombus hypnorum is less sensitive.

To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape."",2018/08/29/,2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0655,285,1885,,,0962-8452,WOS:000443163500004,,,,,,,0,,0,155";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The introduced parasite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid class of insecticides each represent important, nearly ubiquitous biotic and abiotic stressors to honey bees, respectively. Previous research demonstrated that they can synergistically interact to negatively affect non-reproductive honey bee female workers, but no data exist on how concurrent exposure may affect reproductive honey bee males (drones). This is important, given that the health of reproductive females (queens), possibly because of poor mating, is frequently cited as a major driver of honey bee colony loss. To address this, known age cohorts of drones were obtained from 12 honey bee colonies‚Äîseven were exposed to field-relevant concentrations of two neonicotinoids (4.5 ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5 ppb clothianidin) during development via supplementary pollen patties";" five colonies received patties not spiked with neonicotinoids. Artificially emerged drones were assessed for natural V. destructor infestation, weighed, and then allocated to the following treatment groups: 1. Control, 2. V. destructor only, 3. Neonicotinoid only, and 4. Combined (both mites and neonicotinoid). Adult drones were maintained in laboratory cages alongside attendant workers (1 drone: 2 worker ratio) until they have reached sexual maturity after 14 days so sperm concentration and viability could be assessed. The data suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids interacted synergistically to negatively affect adult drone survival, but that they interacted antagonistically on emergence mass. Although sample sizes were too low to assess the effects of V. destructor and combined exposure on sperm quality, we observed no influence of neonicotinoids on sperm concentration or viability. Our findings highlight the diverse effects of concurrent exposure to stressors on honey bees, and suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids can severely affect the number of sexually mature adult drones available for mating.

In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ‚â•0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ‚â•1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees.

These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ‚â§ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ‚â§10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. ¬© 2024 The Authors"",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current"; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,,,0,,0,163;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving.

Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform¬Æ. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted‚Äîa shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and Transform¬Æ, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform¬Æ exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto‚Ñ¢, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. ¬© 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

"304,764,JOUR,LD50 values may be misleading predictors of neonicotinoid toxicity across different bee species,""['Mayack, C.', 'Boff, S.']"",Uludag Aricilik Dergisi,""The importance of not only honey bees (Apis mellifera) but also other non-managed bee species and their pollination services has come to light with their recently reported declines. One contributing factor in these declines is thought to be sub-lethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides such as thiacloprid. However, current government regulatory agencies do not require the assessment of insecticide toxicity on bee species other than the honey bee, even though previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to insecticides is not likely to be generalizable from honey bees to non-managed bee species. Replicating standardized protocols and testing five different doses of thiacloprid on individual caged bees, we assessed the acute contact toxicity by calculating mortality and the lethal dose (LD50) value for three bee species with different life history traits: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis. We found that Apis mellifera and Osmia bicomis had significantly higher mortality in comparison to Bombus terrestris, but there was no dose-dependent response for any of the three bee species. Bee size and sex were also not useful predictors of thiacloprid toxicity. These results suggest that solely relying on LD50 values, especially when they do not produce a dose-dependent response, may be misleading when assessing insecticide toxicity risk for honey bees and other non-managed bee species.

Declines in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for synergistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure (-50%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors reduced also food consumption (-48%) and haemolymph levels of glucose (-60%) and trehalose (-27%). Our results provide the first demonstration that field-realistic nutritional stress and pesticide exposure can synergistically interact and cause significant harm to animal survival.

It is imperative to identify factors responsible for accelerated declines in bee populations and develop solutions for reversing bee losses. While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees. Measurement of the quantitative effects of different levels of Varroa mite infestation on the replication dynamic of Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus associated with Varroa infestation, and expression level of immune genes yields unique insights into how honey bees respond to stressors under laboratory conditions. ¬© 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"",2017///,2017,10.1111/1744-7917.12335,24,3,467,477,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995640098&doi=10.1111%2f1744-7917.12335&partnerID=40&md5=659cf5d6185c0bf5967ba20a021aebc4,Scopus,,0,,0,170";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Because the presence of sublethal doses or concentrations may also alter the behavior of foraging insects, we attempted to devise a quantifiable and accurate protocol for evidencing various alterations in free-flying bees. Such a protocol was illustrated by testing new classes of systemic insecticides. The protocol focused on video recording to quantify the foraging activity of small colonies of honey bees confined in insect-proof tunnels. The basis of the protocol was not the colony itself but the change in each colony on a specific day and between days. First, the paradigms of attendance at a safe feeding source were established by observing 8 control colonies at different times of the season during 5 days after the necessary forager training was accomplished. Second, on three different colonies we considered the paradigms on the control day before contamination and during 4 days after the feeding source was contaminated. During the same period, one more colony was exclusively fed with safe food to serve as control. Two plant-systemic insecticides were tested at contamination levels 70 times lower than the 50% of the lethal concentration. Imidacloprid, at 6 mug/kg, clearly induced a decrease in the proportion of active bees. Fipronil, at 2 mug/kg, induced an additional decrease in attendance at the feeder. Such levels are still higher than the corresponding lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC).

"39,793,JOUR,Impaired associative learning after chronic exposure to pesticides in young adult honey bees,""['Gonalons, C.M.', 'Farina, W.M.']"",Journal of Experimental Biology,""Neonicotinoids are the most widespread insecticides in agriculture, preferred for their low toxicity to mammals and their systemic nature. Nevertheless, there have been increasing concerns regarding their impact on non-target organisms. Glyphosate is also widely used in crops and, therefore, traces of this pesticide are likely to be found together with neonicotinoids. Although glyphosate is considered a herbicide, adverse effects have been found on animal species, including honey bees. Apis mellifera is one of the most important pollinators in agroecosystems and is exposed to both these pesticides. Traces can be found in nectar and pollen of flowers that honey bees visit, but also in honey stores inside the hive. Young workers, which perform in-hive tasks that are crucial for colony maintenance, are potentially exposed to both these contaminated resources. These workers present high plasticity and are susceptible to stimuli that can modulate their behaviour and impact on colony state. Therefore, by performing standardised assays to study sublethal effects of these pesticides, these bees can be used as bioindicators. We studied the effect of chronic joint exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and glyphosate on gustatory perception and olfactory learning. Both pesticides reduced sucrose responsiveness and had a negative effect on olfactory learning. Glyphosate also reduced food uptake during rearing. The results indicate differential susceptibility according to honey bee age. The two agrochemicals had adverse effects on different aspects of honey bee appetitive behaviour, which could have repercussions for food distribution, propagation of olfactory information and task coordination within the nest. ¬© 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology."",2018///,2018,10.1242/jeb.176644,221,7,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045350300&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.176644&partnerID=40&md5=e57097603f1fcd42ba06cc7571845ede,Scopus,,0,,0,172";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss.

Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips.

Agricultural intensification, which is connected with pesticide usage, is among major threats to bees and, thus, to the food security and ecosystem stability. As it may not be possible to cease pesticide usage currently because of the growing demand for food, it is crucial to understand the pesticide toxicities to bees for better protection of pollinator populations. The majority of studies have focused on social bees, and those on solitary bees studied effects of adult exposure, whereas these bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here, the effects of three commonly used insecticide-based plant protection products on the development of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis (red mason bee), were studied by exposing larvae to insecticide-contaminated multifloral pollen. The tested insecticides were: Dursban480EC, containing the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (CHP), Sherpa100EC, containing the pyrethroid cypermethrin (CYP), and Mospilan20SP with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid (ACT). When compared to the control larvae fed with uncontaminated-pollen, both CHP and CYP significantly reduced the O. bicornis larval survival and their body mass at all tested concentrations. In contrast, ACT did not affect either larval survival or body mass, but the length of larval stage to cocoon formation was significantly shortened compared to controls. None of studied insecticides affected the mass of cocooned individuals. However, at least 80% of individuals exposed to any of the tested insecticides died before reaching the adult stage, whereas 43% of the controls emerged successfully after overwintering. Although no clear monotonic dose-response relationships were found, our study showed that at least some insecticide formulations affect the development of O. bicornis even at concentrations actually found in pollen in the field, indicating an urgent need for revising current pesticide usage recommendations. ¬© 2021 The Authors"",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145588,775,,,,,,""['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Agricultural intensification', 'Agricultural robots', 'Agriculture', 'agrochemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee disease', 'Bees', 'body mass', 'Chemical contamination', 'chlorpyrifos', 'cocoon', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'cypermethrin', 'death', 'Ecological risk assessment', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystem stability', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecotoxicology', 'female', 'Food security', 'Food supply', 'Growing demand', 'insect larva', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larval development', 'larval stage', 'Larval survival', 'male', 'Monotonic dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia rufa', 'overwintering', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide', 'Plant protection products', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Red mason bee', 'risk assessment', 'survival', 'Toxicity']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100902427&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.145588&partnerID=40&md5=ada10602eb674fe7d7622c23dbe9b6e0,Scopus,,0,,0,180";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This species is commercially produced primarily for greenhouse crop pollination and is a common and abundant component of the wild bumblebee fauna in agricultural, suburban and urban landscapes. However, there is a dearth of pesticide toxicity information about North American bumblebees. The present study determined the acute oral lethal toxicity (48-h LD50) of: the butenolide, flupyradifurone (>1.7 Œºg/bee)"; the diamide, cyantraniliprole (>0.54 Œºg/bee); the neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam (0.0012 Œºg/bee);" and the sulfoximine, sulfoxaflor (0.0177 Œºg/bee). Compared with published honey bee (Apis mellifera) LD50 values, the present study shows that sulfoxaflor and thiamethoxam are 8.3√ó and 3.3√ó more acutely toxic to B. impatiens, whereas flupyradifurone is more acutely toxic to A. mellifera. The current rule of thumb for toxicity extrapolation beyond the honey bee as a model species, termed 10√ó safety factor, may be sufficient for bumblebee acute oral toxicity. A comparison of five risk assessment equations suggested that the Standard Risk Approach (SRA) and Fixed Dose Risk Approach (FDRA) provide more nuanced levels of risk evaluation compared to the Exposure Toxicity Ratio (ETR), Hazard Quotient (HQ), and Risk Quotient (RQ), primarily because the SRA and FDRA take into account real world variability in pollen and nectar pesticide residues and the chances that bees may be exposed to them. ¬© 2022 The Authors"",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133771,295,,,,,,""['adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bioassay', 'Bombus impatiens', 'Bumble bee', 'controlled study', 'cyantraniliprole', 'drug toxicity', 'Eastern Canada', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'electrospray', 'female', 'Food products', 'greenhouse', 'heuristics', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'human', 'human experiment', 'humidity', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'limit of quantitation', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'male', 'mortality', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Non-apis bee', 'Non-Apis bees', 'Non-target exposure', 'North America', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'pharmacokinetic parameters', 'Plant Nectar', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator ecotoxicology', 'Risk approaches', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Safety factor', 'sugar', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124092732&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.133771&partnerID=40&md5=e8fd9e84f38ffb9a0828a8dcd30a93fe,Scopus,,0,,0,181";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0¬†ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects.

However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure";" uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results.

Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to their decline, but the increasing use of neonicotinoid insecticides has recently emerged as particularly concerning. In this study, honey bees were exposed orally to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the field in order to assess its effects on the foraging behavior, homing success, and dance communication. The foraging span and foraging activity at the contaminated feeder decreased significantly due to chronic exposure at field-realistic concentrations. Electrostatic field of dancing bees was measured and it was revealed that the number of waggle runs, the fanning time and the number of stop signals were significantly lower in the exposed colony. No difference was found in the homing success and the flight duration between control and treated bees released at a novel location within the explored area. However, a negative effect of the ambient temperature, and an influence of the location of the trained feeder was found. Finally, the residues of clothianidin accumulated in the abdomens of exposed foraging bees over time. These results show the adverse effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal doses of clothianidin on foraging and dance communication in honey bees. ¬© 2020 Tison et al.

The metabolites with high level of abundance enriched to wide range pathways associated with oxidative stress and detoxification suggest that the honey bees have activated their detoxification system to resistant toxicity of thiacloprid.

Specifically, neonicotinoids, some of which are banned for outdoor use in the European Union (EU), have been pointed out as a major cause of bee collapse. Thus, farmers have had to look for alternatives for pest control and use known insecticides or new substances reportedly less harmful to bees. We evaluated the oral acute toxicity of six insecticides (three of them systemic: imidacloprid, thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor) with four different modes of action on buff-tailed bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris): two banned neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid), two pyrethroids (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate), one sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) and a microbial insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, present in genetically modified (Bt) maize. The microbial insecticide only caused mortality to bumblebee workers at extremely high concentrations, so it is expected that Bt maize does not pose a risk to them. The toxicity of the other five insecticides on bumblebees was, from highest to lowest: imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and thiacloprid. This outcome suggests that certain insecticides in use are more toxic to B. terrestris than some banned neonicotinoids.

However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions.

In this study, we assessed the potential exposure of pollinators to various systemic insecticides and a fungicide used in apple orchards. Residue levels were determined for the whole flower as well as pollen and nectar separately for pre-bloom applications of acetamiprid, imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and myclobutanil. Very low pesticide residue levels (2‚Äì70 parts per billion, ppb) were found in the whole flower, pollen and nectar samples compared with pesticide concentrations of 60‚Äì200 parts per million (ppm) in applied foliarly only 5 days earlier. Insecticide residues from nectar and pollen samples were below the USA EPA classification of No Observable Effect Limit (NOEL) for acute toxicity to honey bees, suggesting that a single foraging visit to flowers may not cause toxicity to bees. However, cumulative acute exposure from multiple flower visits could potentially be harmful to bees, and needs to be studied further. We also examined apple flowers for residues of several systemic insecticides that were applied for brown marmorated stink bug control late in the fall of the previous season.

Based on these findings, fall applications of insecticides used for controlling invasive pests such as the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) and the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) could be considered safe to pollinator species foraging in apple orchards during the spring bloom the following season. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd"",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114589,265,,,,,,""['acetamiprid', 'Active ingredients', 'acute toxicity', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Agricultural robots', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'apple', 'apple orchard', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'beta cyfluthrin', 'Blooms (metal)', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'cyhalothrin', 'dinotefuran', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'ecosystem function', 'Ecosystem services', 'Ecosystems', 'exposure', 'falling', 'flower', 'foraging', 'Fruits', 'fungicide', 'Fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'government regulation', 'Halyomorpha halys', 'Honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insect', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lambda-cyhalothrin', 'Lycorma delicatula', 'Malus', 'Malus x domestica', 'Multiple applications', 'myclobutanil', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'No Observable Effect Limit', 'nonhuman', 'orchard', 'Orchard bees', 'Orchards', 'Parts per millions', 'Pesticide concentrations', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticide residue', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'Potential exposure', 'season', 'Seasons', 'spring', 'sulfoxaflor', 'thiacloprid', 'thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'Toxicity exposure', 'unclassified drug', 'United States']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085940525&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2020.114589&partnerID=40&md5=763e81d97d1651bb53b9570984feec99,Scopus,,0,,0,188";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus¬Æ Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan¬Æ (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations. In addition, the honeybee seems to be quite robust when it comes to effects of plant protection products, while wild bees might be more sensitive. ¬© 2023 The Authors"",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114850,256,,,,,,""['2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'concentration (composition)', 'controlled study', 'dimoxystrobin', 'environmental factor', 'frequency analysis', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'LD50', 'learning', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'noise', 'Non-SBI fungicide', 'nonhuman', 'odor', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effect', 'sucrose', 'Sucrose', 'synergistic effect', 'Synergistic effect', 'unclassified drug']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151449855&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.114850&partnerID=40&md5=a4543218cf5c3c02e16cd36104e44456,Scopus,,0,,0,191";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For solitary bees, delayed larval development could lead to asynchronous adult emergence, unhealthy and inefficient adult pollinators, and decreased brood production and survival. We examined a methodology for testing Osmia lignaria Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) larval responses to pesticide exposure using a laboratory bioassay. We created two provision types: a homogenized blend of O. lignaria provisions from an apple orchard and homogenized almond pollen pellets collected by honey bees plus sugar water. Pesticides were administered to the provisions to compare toxic effects. We recorded larval developmental durations for second-fifth instar and for fifth instar to cocoon initiation for larvae fed provisions treated with water (control) or doses of three pesticides and a representative spray-tank mixture (acetamiprid, boscalid/pyraclostrobin, dimethoate, and acetamiprid plus boscalid/pyraclostrobin). All larvae survived to cocoon initiation when only water was added to provisions. Impacts of pesticide treatments significantly differed between the apple and almond homogenates. The greatest treatment effects occurred when the homogenized almond provision was mixed with acetamiprid alone and when combined with boscalid/pyraclostrobin.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + Œª -cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%. The LC 50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient, which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee (LD 50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 Œºl per bee per day. In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC 50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville (MS, United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations, clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees. ¬© Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2018."",2018///,2018,10.1093/jee/toy140,111,4,1517,1525,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053733948&doi=10.1093%2fjee%2ftoy140&partnerID=40&md5=35bbee65087b34aab15e9e1271c6097a,Scopus,,0,,0,193";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several studies show that neonicotinoids affect navigation and learning in bees but few studies have examined whether these substances influence their basic motor function. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to sublethal doses of four neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, dinotefuran) and the plant toxin, nicotine, affect basic motor function and postural control in foraging-age worker honeybees. We used doses of 10¬†nM for each neonicotinoid: field-relevant doses that we determined to be sublethal and willingly consumed by bees. The neonicotinoids were placed in food solutions given to bees for 24¬†h. After the exposure period, bees were more likely to lose postural control during the motor function assay and fail to right themselves if exposed to imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin. Bees exposed to thiamethoxam and nicotine also spent more time grooming. Other behaviours (walking, sitting and flying) were not significantly affected. Expression of changes in motor function after exposure to imidacloprid was dose-dependent and affected all measured behaviours. Our data illustrate that 24¬†h exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoid pesticides has a subtle influence on bee behaviour that is likely to affect normal function in a field setting. ¬© 2014, The Author(s)."",2014///,2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1283-x,23,8,1409,1418,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84912037552&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-014-1283-x&partnerID=40&md5=973a4e18f3653de97b0a0ae5d675f049,Scopus,,0,,0,194";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. ¬© 2016 D√©mares et al.

Therefore, the pre-emptive evaluation of the potential effects of new compounds is essential. To this aim both lethal and sublethal effects should be assessed in a realistic scenario including the other stressors that can interact with pesticides. However, laboratory studies addressing such interactive effects are rare, while standardized laboratory-based protocols focus on lethal effects and not on sub-lethal effects. We propose to assess both lethal and sublethal effects in a multifactorial context including the other stressors affecting the non-target species. We tested this approach by studying the impact on honey bees of the insecticide sulfoxaflor in combination with a common parasite, a sub-optimal temperature and food deprivation. We studied the survival and the transcriptome of honey bees, to assess both the lethal and the potential sublethal effects of the insecticide, respectively. With this method we show that a field realistic concentration of sulfoxaflor in food does not affect the survival of honey bees";" however, the significant impact on some key genes indicates that sublethal effects are possible in a realistically complex scenario. Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a novel approach to hazard assessment considering the interactive effects of pesticides.

At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions.

Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids can affect insects‚Äô behavioral and physiological performance, and the detoxification of these pesticides likely affects insects‚Äô metabolism. We measured honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) foragers‚Äô CO2 production rates at different temperatures (25, 30, or 35 ¬∞C) after they consumed syrup dosed with a field realistic (5 ¬µg/L) or high (20 ¬µg/L) concentration of a neon-icotinoid insecticide (i.e. imidacloprid) for 48 hours. We found that imidacloprid exposure significantly disrupted honey bees‚Äô non-flight metabolic rates and there was a significant interaction between imidacloprid dosage and ambient temperature. Honey bee foragers dosed with 5 ¬µg/L imidacloprid displayed higher average metabolic rates and those dosed with 20 ¬µg/L imidacloprid displayed similar average metabolic rates compared to the corresponding control group across all temperatures. Exposure to fi eld realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid may have a higher energetic cost for honey bees at 25 ¬∞C than at higher ambient tempera-tures. Disrupted energy costs in honey bees fed imidacloprid might be due to the thermoregulation, nerve excitation, or detoxification processes. Metabolic rate changes caused by pesticide exposure could result in less available energy for honey bees to per-form hive duties and forage, which could negatively affect colony health. ¬© 2020, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Yet, such effects may vary between pesticides, dosage, application timing and pollinator assemblage in the study area. Understanding such diversity of effects is essential to enable integrated pest management practices that minimize negative impacts on pollinators. Here, we use a controlled experiment to compare different strategies of pesticide application in tomato crops: no application, low-intensity applications (every 7 days) and high-intensity application (every 3-4 days) with the last being the usual practice used by farmers in the study region. We focus on imidacloprid that is a neonicotinoid insecticide commonly used in Brazil. We show the negative effects of imidacloprid on the pollinator visitation rate of tomato flowers varied between flower visitor species. While the bee Paratrigona lineata was negatively affected by the imidacloprid application, no effects were detected when analysing all other bees as a group, indicating a null net effect. Although some studies have shown this insecticide is extremely harmful to bees' health, others showed that some bees do not avoid it, which may explain our results. However, the visitation rate recovery for P. lineata was only detected in the less than the more intensive treatment after imidacloprid applications ceased. The fact that no differences in fruit production were detected between treatments (including control blocks) could result from a null net effect of the negative effects on pollinators and positive effects on pest control.

Exposure to trace levels of these chemicals causes sub-lethal effects, such as reduced learning and foraging efficiency. Complex behaviours may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids. Such behaviours may include buzz pollination (sonication), in which pollinators, usually bees, use innate and learned behaviours to generate high-frequency vibrations to release pollen from flowers with specialised anther morphologies. This study assesses the effect of field-realistic, chronic exposure to the widely-used neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on the development of sonication buzz characteristics over time, as well as the collection of pollen from buzz-pollinated flowers. We found that the pollen collection of exposed bees improved less with increasing experience than that of unexposed bees, with exposed bees collecting between 47% and 56% less pollen by the end of 10 trials. We also found evidence of two distinct strategies for maximising pollen collection: (1) extensions to the duration of individual buzzes and (2) extensions of the overall time spent buzzing. We find new complexities in buzz pollination, and conclude that the impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide may seriously compromise this important ecosystem service."",2017/11/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-14660-x,7,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000415166000058,,,,,,,0,,0,206";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 ŒºL 1¬†M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 ŒºL of 1.5¬†M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 ŒºL 0.5¬†M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30¬†min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed.

Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment of the level of neonicotinoid contamination and the associated health risks to non-targeted organisms in commercial honey and pollen produced in China. This study collected 160 batches of honey and 26 batches of pollen from different regions and plant sources in China, analyzed the residue patterns of neonicotinoid pesticides, and comprehensively evaluated the exposure risks to non-targeted organisms including bees (adults and larvae) and humans. Furthermore, this study addresses this imperative by establishing a high-throughput, rapid, and ultra-sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) based on broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies to detect and quantify neonicotinoids, with validation conducted using the LC-MS/MS method. The findings indicated that 59.4 % of honey samples contained at least one of eight neonicotinoids, and the ic-ELISA rapid detection and calculation method could detect all the samples containing neonicotinoids. Additionally, the dietary risk assessment for humans and honeybees indicates that the consumption of a specific quantity of honey may not pose a health risk to human due to neonicotinoid intake. However, the Risk Quotient values for imidacloprid to adult bees and bee larvae, as well as clothianidin to bee larvae, were determined to be 2.22, 5.03, and 1.01, respectively-each exceeding 1.

Monarchs rely on milkweed over multiple life stages, including as a host plant for eggs and a food source for both larvae (leaves) and adults (flowers). Milkweeds, which are closely associated with field margins, can contain neonicotinoid residues, but previous assessments are constrained to a single plant tissue type. In 2017 and 2018, we sampled milkweeds from 95 field margins adjacent to crop fields (corn, soybean, hay, wheat, and barley) in agricultural landscapes of eastern Ontario, Canada. Milkweeds were sampled during the flower blooming period and leaves and flower tissues were analysed. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid were detected. Maximum concentrations in leaf samples included 10.30 ng/g of clothianidin in 2017, and 24.4 ng/g of thiamethoxam in 2018. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam percent detections in flowers (72 % and 61 %, respectively) were significantly higher than detections in leaves (24 % and 31 %, respectively). Thiamethoxam concentrations were significantly higher in paired flower samples than leaf samples (median 0.33 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g) while clothianidin concentrations also trended higher in flowers (median 0.18‚Äì0.55 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g). Only thiamethoxam showed significant differences between years, and we found no effect of crop type, with hay, soybean and corn fields all yielding 50‚Äì56 % detections in leaves.

The total larval protein expression was investigated by 2D gel electrophoresis after exposure to the insecticides dimethoate, fenoxycarb and flupyradifurone. Protein spots whose concentrations differed significantly from the controls were sequenced and identified against known insect proteins. Although the treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development, the proteome comparisons showed differences in the metabolism, immune response and energy supply of the bee larvae.

Like neonicotinoids, sulfoxaflor acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agricultural environments, bees are commonly exposed to combinations of pesticides, and neonicotinoids are known to interact synergistically with fungicides. The objective of our study is to assess the acute oral toxicity of sulfoxaflor alone and in combination with a single dose of fluxapyroxad, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide, in three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis. Because synergism may be dose-dependent, we tested a range of sulfoxaflor doses. Synergistic effects were assessed using three different approaches: Bliss criterion of drugs independence, ratio test comparing LD50s and model deviation ratio. Osmia bicornis was the most sensitive species to sulfoxaflor and both O. bicornis and A. mellifera showed significant synergism between the insecticide and the fungicide. For the most part, these synergistic effects were weak and only occurred at early assessment times and intermediate sulfoxaflor doses. The potential ecological relevance of these effects should be confirmed in field and/or cage studies. Overall, our laboratory results demonstrate that sulfoxaflor is somewhat less toxic than the recently banned neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, but much more toxic than other neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, thiacloprid) still in use in the EU at the time this study was conducted. ¬© 2021, The Author(s)."",2021///,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-86036-1,11,1,,,,,""['amide', 'Amides', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'drug effect', 'drug potentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'environmental monitoring', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'fluxapyroxad', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103413914&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-86036-1&partnerID=40&md5=59f95b35b3fb145cad24be26b364e1ff,Scopus,,0,,0,215";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In response to mounting evidence supporting the detrimental effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, a novel 'bee safe' butenolide compound, flupyradifurone (FPF) has been registered for use in agricultural use. Although FPF is not a neonicotinoid, like neonicotinoids, it is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. In addition, A. mellifera faces threats from pathogens, such as the microsporidian endoparasite, Nosema ceranae (Fries et al. 1996). We therefore sought 1) to increase our understanding of the potential effects of FPF on honey bees by focusing on a crucial behavior, the ability to learn and remember an odor associated with a food reward, and 2) to test for a potential synergistic effect on such learning by exposure to FPF and infection with N. ceranae. We found little evidence that FPF significantly alters learning and memory at short-term field-realistic doses. However, at high doses and at chronic, field-realistic exposure, FPF did reduce learning and memory in an olfactory conditioning task. Infection with N. ceranae also reduced learning, but there was no synergy (no significant interaction) between N. ceranae and exposure to FPF. These results suggest the importance of continued studies on the chronic effects of FPF.  ¬© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

For Cucurbita crops in the chronic exposure scenario, exposure risks for clothianidin and imidacloprid exceeded 5% for all endpoints, and exposure risk for chlorantraniliprole was below 5% for all endpoints. In field crops, risk to ground-nesting bees was high from clothianidin in all exposure scenarios and high for thiamethoxam and imidacloprid under chronic exposure scenarios.

However, potential long-lasting or delayed effects resulting from an acute exposure (e.g. a single dose) are often overlooked, although the modification of a developmental process may have life-long consequences. To investigate this question, we exposed young honeybee workers to a single sublethal field-realistic dose of a neurotoxic pesticide, sulfoxaflor, at one of two amounts (16 or 60 ng), at the moment when they initiated orientation flights (preceding foraging activity). We then tracked in the field their flight activity and lifespan with automated life-long monitoring devices. Both amounts of sulfoxaflor administered reduced the total number of flights but did not affect bee survival and flight duration. When looking at the time series of flight activity, effects were not immediate but delayed until foraging activity with a decrease in the daily number of foraging flights and consequently in their total number (24 and 33% less for the 16 and 60 ng doses, respectively). The results of our study therefore blur the general assumption in honeybee toxicology that acute exposure results in immediate and rapid effects and call for long-term recording and/or time-to-effect measurements, even upon exposure to a single dose of pesticide. ¬© 2021"",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150351,805,,,,,,""['Acute exposure', 'Acute toxicity', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee', 'Bees', 'biological monitoring', 'clinical assessment', 'comparative study', 'controlled study', 'Delayed effects', 'developmental process', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'experimental study', 'flight', 'flight activity', 'Flight activity', 'foraging', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'image analysis', 'immunocompetence', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'nectar', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxin', 'nonhuman', 'normal distribution', 'orientation', 'pesticide', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'pollen allergy', 'practice guideline', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'short term exposure', 'Single-dose', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'sucrose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival analysis', 'survival rate', 'unclassified drug']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114984109&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.150351&partnerID=40&md5=88cf178a7d135cd1894a0f2a45089ecb,Scopus,,0,,0,219";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Even though there is consensus that neonicotinoid insecticides can impact non-target animal fertility, their possible impact on male mating success is currently unknown in bees. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid significantly reduces both mating success and sperm traits of male bumblebees. Sexually mature male Bombus terrestris exposed to a field-realistic concentration of thiamethoxam (20 ng g‚àí1) or not (controls) were mated with virgin gynes in the laboratory. The results confirm sublethal negative effects of thiamethoxam on sperm quantity and viability. While the latency to mate was reduced, mating success was significantly impaired in thiamethoxam-exposed males by 32% probably due to female choice. Gynes mated by exposed males revealed impaired sperm traits compared to their respective controls, which may lead to severe constraints for colony fitness. Our laboratory findings demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male mating success in bees. Given that holds true for the field, this provides a plausible mechanism contributing to declines of wild bee populations globally.

Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup¬Æ and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival";" however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction.

We asked whether the combination of a frequently used insecticide and fungicides would affect developing bees. Honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera carnica) were reared in vitro on larval diets containing different PPPs at two concentrations, derived from residues found in pollen. We used the neonicotinoid acetamiprid, the combined fungicides boscalid/dimoxystrobin and the mixture of all three substances. Mortality was assessed at larval, pupal, and adult stages, and the size and weight of newly emerged bees were measured. The insecticide treatment in higher concentrations significantly reduced larval and adult survival. Interestingly, survival was not affected by the high concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture. However, negative synergistic effects on adult survival were caused by the low concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture, which had no effect when applied alone. The lower concentrated combined fungicides led to significantly lighter adult bees, although the survival was unaffected.

"321,969,JOUR,Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides,""['Matsumoto, T.']"",Bulletin of Insectology,""The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid."",2013///,2013,,66,1,1,9,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877647374&partnerID=40&md5=3cd1d9f5b223c005f59c51d378ee1e27,Scopus,,0,,0,229";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Honey bees as well as other pollinators are nectar and pollen foragers and thus are exposed to an extensive range of phytochemicals. Understanding the synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects of plant secondary metabolites and pesticides in honey bees may help to protect honey bee colonies against agrochemicals. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the impact of dietary phytochemical composition on the residual concentration of three pesticides: imidacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and tebuconazole in exposed honey bees. Honey bees were given different diets based on pollen or nectar from four plants: Reseda odorata, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Trifolium repens for two days. Thereafter, they were orally exposed to 10 ng/bee imidacloprid or contact-exposed to 0.9 Œºg/bee tau-fluvalinate or 5 Œºg/bee tebuconazole. After 1 h of oral exposure or 24 h of contact exposure, the honey bees were anaesthetised with CO2, sacrificed by freezing, extracted with a validated QuEChERS method, and residual pesticide concentrations were determined by LC-QTRAP-MS/MS. The phytochemical composition in the given diets were profiled with an UHPLC-Q Exactive-MS/MS. The results revealed that the dietary phytochemical composition has a noteworthy influence on the concentration of residual pesticides in honey bees. The correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that flavonoids have a reducing effect on the residual concentration of imidacloprid and tau-fluvalinate in honey bees. The results also highlighted that exposure to imidacloprid impaired the metabolism of sugars in honey bees.

We show that thiamethoxam, at a dose of 0.25 ng/bee/day, is quickly and effectively metabolised into clothianidin, throughout a 20 day exposure period. Using a similar chronic exposure to pesticide, we then studied, in a separate experiment, the impact of thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) co-exposure in honeybees. The honeybees were exposed to the virus by contact, mimicking the natural transmission route in the hive. We demonstrate that a high dose of thiamethoxam (5.0 ng/bee/day) can cause a synergistic increase in mortality in co-exposed honeybees after 8 to 10 days of exposure, with no increase in viral loads. At a lower dose (2.5 ng/bee/day), there was no synergistic increase of mortality, but viral loads were significantly higher in naturally dead honeybees, compared with sacrificed honeybees exposed to the same conditions.

Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have a negative impact on honey bees. Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages. All tested honey bees exposed to Varroa had significantly elevated DWV loads.

Risk assessments have reported its high toxicity to pollinators. However, sulfoxaflor is not persistent in the environment and few studies have addressed its negative effects on larval and newly emerged honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, the sublethal effects of a sulfoxaflor commercial product, Isoclast‚Ñ¢ Active, were evaluated in the laboratory using larvae and newly emerged worker honeybees. The results of 96-h acute toxicity showed that Isoclast is moderately toxic to adult bees, and it could induce significant death and growth failure of larvae after continuous dietary intake. In addition, Isoclast induced significant changes in antioxidative (SOD, CAT), lipid peroxidation (POD, LPO, MDA), detoxification (GST, GR, GSH) and signal transduction-related (AChE, ACh) enzymes or products both in larvae and adult honey bees under residue levels.

Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies.

Here we apply these mixture models to investigate the potential to interpret the effects of semi-chronic binary mixture exposure for three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis within potentiation and mixture toxicity experiments. In the potentiation studies, the effect of the insecticide dimethoate with added propiconazole fungicide and neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin with added tau-fluvalinate pyrethroid acari-cide showed no difference in toxicity compared to the single chemical alone. Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of exposures to multiple chemicals, there is an urgent need to consider mixture effects in pollinator risk assessments. Our analyses suggest that current models, particularly those that utilise time-series data, such as DEBtox, can be used to identify additivity as the dominant response pattern and also those examples of interactions, even when small-scale, that may need to be taken into account during risk assessment. ¬© 2017 Robinson et al.

Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‚Äòindicator‚Äô species for ‚Äòstandard‚Äô ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (< 2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation.

Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to >= 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food."",2016/06/10/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0156886,11,6,,,1932-6203,WOS:000377564000029,,,,,,,0,,0,241";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As honeybee colonies can be frequently exposed to bio-aggressors in real conditions, often concomitantly with pesticides, co-exposure to pesticidei/bio-aggressors is becoming a concern for regulatory authorities. We investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the homing performances of foragers emerging from colonies differentiated by health status (infestation with Varroa destructor mites, microsporidian parasite Nosema spp. and Deformed Wing Virus). We designed a homing test that has been recently identified to fill a regulatory gap in the field evaluations of sublethal doses of pesticides before their registration. We also assessed the effect of temperature as an environmental factor.

During their lifetime bumblebees are regularly challenged by various environmental stressors including insecticides. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing, but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other eusocial or solitary bees. To investigate this, the susceptibility of B. terrestris to selected pesticides within the neonicotinoid, pyrethroid and organophosphate classes was examined using acute insecticide bioassays. Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acet-amiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds. The sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species. This finding highlights the need to consider each compound within an insecticide class in isolation rather than extrapolating between different insecticides in the same class or sharing the same mode of action."",2020/06//undefined,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104562,166,,,,0048-3575,WOS:000536197700006,,,,,,,0,,0,245";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood.

These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication.

While there is widespread concern regarding the impact of pesticides on honey bees, well-replicated field experiments, to date, have failed to provide clear insights on pesticide effects. Here, we adopt a systems biology approach to gain insights into the web of interactions amongst the factors influencing honey bee health. We put the focus on the properties of the system that depend upon its architecture and not on the strength, often unknown, of each single interaction.

We show that the impact of toxic compounds on honey bee health can be shaped by the concurrent stressors affecting bees. We demonstrate that the immune-suppressive capacity of the widespread pathogen of bees, deformed wing virus, can introduce a critical positive feed-back loop in the system causing bistability, i.e., two stable equilibria. Therefore, honey bees under similar initial conditions can experience different consequences when exposed to the same stressor, including prolonged survival or premature death.

In the electromagnetic-stress site, the effect of an over-activation of all analyzed biomarkers was observed at the end of the season. According to other literature findings, this event was related to a behavioral over-activation in a period in which bees should prepare themselves for overwintering. This finding poses potential problems for winter survival. In the pesticide-stress site, different pesticide-induced responses were identified. We demonstrated in the field that pesticide mixtures currently used in agriculture could greatly affect the biochemical parameters of bees (with both enzymatic under- and over-activations)."",2020/02//undefined,2020,10.1007/s41742-019-00242-4,14,1,107,122,1735-6865,WOS:000505333300001,,,,,,,0,,0,255";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Among the main drivers of diminishing bee populations is the widespread use of agrochemicals. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the foraging dynamics of bees at agrochemical-contaminated areas, it is essential to consider both environmental conditions and the specific foraging ecology of bee species. For the first time, we conducted a semi-field study to investigate whether stingless bees exhibit a preference for food contaminated with agrochemicals compared to non- contaminated food, under natural weather conditions. Colonies of Plebeia lucii Moure, 2004 were placed in a greenhouse and subjected to a preference test, where bees were given the freedom to choose between contaminated or non-contaminated food sources following a preliminary training period. Within the greenhouse, we placed feeders containing realistic concentrations of an insecticide (acephate: 2 mg a.i./L), a herbicide (glyphosate: 31.3 mg a.i./L), or a mixture of both, alongside non- contaminated food. Environmental variables (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) were monitored throughout the experiment. At higher temperatures, the foragers preferred food containing the mixture of both agrochemicals or uncontaminated food over the other treatments. At lower temperatures, by contrast, the bees preferred food laced with a single agrochemical (acephate or glyphosate) over uncontaminated food or the agrochemical mixture. Our findings indicate that agrochemical residues in nectar pose a significant threat to P. lucii colonies, as foragers do not actively avoid contaminated food, despite the detrimental effects of acephate and glyphosate on bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even minor, natural fluctuations in environmental conditions can alter the colony exposure risk. Despite the interplay between temperature and bees' preference for contaminated food, foragers consistently collected contaminated food containing both agrochemicals, whether isolated or in combination, throughout the whole experiment."",2024/11/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175892,952,,,,0048-9697,WOS:001308859900001,,,,,,,0,,0,256";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was believed that the processing factor (PF) is an important variable to determine the final pesticide residue during royal jelly formation and the actual risk to honeybee larva. Hence, a QuEChERS method to determine acetamiprid contents in honeybee samples was established in this study. Then, the PFs for acetamiprid in beebread fermentation, honey brewing, and royal jelly formation were determined to be 0.85, 0.76, and 0.16, respectively. The PF for royal jelly formation was 0.04 when acetamiprid was detected in beebread alone, and it was 0.12 when acetamiprid was only detected in honey. Finally, the predicted exposure concentration of acetamiprid in royal jelly was calculated to be 2.05¬†¬µg/kg using the PF without significant difference with the 90th percentile value (3.64¬†¬µg/kg) in the actual sample. However, the value was 16.62¬†¬µg/kg without considering the PF.

IMD is known to disrupt honey bee physiology and colony health at a relatively low concentration compared to other pesticides. In this study, honey bee colonies were chronically exposed to field-realistic concentrations (5, 20, and 100 ppb) of IMD, and the body weight, flight performance, carbohydrate reserve, and lipid contents of forager bees analyzed. Transcriptome analyses followed by quantitative PCR were also conducted for both nurse and forager bees to elucidate any changes in energy metabolism related to phenotypic disorders. The body weights of newly emerged and nurse bees showed decreasing tendencies as the IMD concentration increased. In forager bees, however, IMD induced a biphasic change in body weight: body weight was decreased at the lower concentrations (5 and 20 ppb) but increased at the higher concentration (100 ppb). Nevertheless, the flight capability of forager bees significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of IMD on target gene transcription in forager bees showed biphasic patterns between low (5 and 20 ppb) and high (100 ppb) concentrations. Nurse bees showed typical features of premature transition to foragers in a concentration-dependent manner. When exposed to low concentrations, forager bees exhibited downregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, upregulation of transporter activity, and a dose-dependent body weight reduction, which were similar to insulin resistance and diabetic symptoms. However, increased lipid metabolism and decreased energy metabolism with body weight gain were observed at high IMD concentration. Considered together, these results suggest that field-realistic doses of IMD alter honey bee energy metabolism in distinctly different ways at low and high concentrations, both of which negatively affect honey bee colony health. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.103759,144,,,,,,""['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Biphasic effect', 'body weight', 'Body Weight', 'carbohydrate', 'Carbohydrate metabolism', 'Carbohydrates', 'Chronic exposure', 'Diabetes', 'Honey bee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127010810&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibmb.2022.103759&partnerID=40&md5=7426091034dbc8f5d210a6320833c0af,Scopus,,0,,0,260";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the complex interactions between gut microbes and environment are still unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that host a core gut microbial community that is thought to be constant across populations. Here, we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two main landscape types for 6¬†weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterized and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. While previous studies have delineated a characteristic core set of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut, our results suggest that the broad environment that bees are exposed to has some influence on the relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. This includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape exposure on honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential effect of exposure to different environmental parameters, such as forage type and neonicotinoid pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria.

Poor colony health or unusually high colony losses of managed honey bees result from a myriad of stressors, which are more harmful in combination. Climate change is expected to accentuate the effects of these stressors, but the physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees to elevated temperatures while under simultaneous influence of one or more stressors remain largely unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that exposure to acute, sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides reduce thermal tolerance in honey bees. We administered to bees oral doses of imidacloprid and acetamiprid at 1/5, 1/20, and 1/100 of LD50 and measured their heat tolerance 4 h post-feeding, using both dynamic and static protocols. Contrary to our expectations, acute exposure to sublethal doses of both insecticides resulted in higher thermal tolerance and greater survival rates of bees. Bees that ingested the higher doses of insecticides displayed a critical thermal maximum from 2 ÃäC to 5 ÃäC greater than that of the control group, and 67%‚Äì87% reduction in mortality. Our study suggests a resilience of honey bees to high temperatures when other stressors are present, which is consistent with studies in other insects.

Here, we asked how an acute exposure to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid (IMD) affected the longevity, immune function and behaviour of bumble bee Bombus impatiens workers maintained on diets enriched with one of three nectar secondary metabolites (NSMs";" the alkaloid caffeine, the terpenoid thymol or the cardiac glycoside digoxin). A factorial design allowed us to assess the potential for additive and interactive effects of each NSM and IMD combination on multiple health outcomes. Without IMD exposure, different dietary NSMs each had positive effects on life span (caffeine), immune function (digoxin) and activity levels (caffeine, thymol), although these came with trade-offs. A single sublethal IMD exposure overshadowed these NSM effects, and in two cases, an NSM-enriched diet magnified the negative effects of pesticide exposure.

Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli.

Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees.

A strong immune defence is vital for the fitness of bees. However, the immune system can be weakened by environmental factors that may render bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid can severely affect the immunocompetence of Osmia bicornis. In detail, males exposed to thiacloprid solutions of 200 and 555 ¬µg/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence - the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph - were impaired in males. In females, however, only a concentration of 555 ¬µg/kg elicited similar immunosuppressive effects. Although males are smaller than females, they consumed more food solution. This leads to a 2.77 times higher exposure in males, probably explaining the different concentration thresholds observed between the sexes. In contrast to honeybees, dietary exposure to thiacloprid did not affect melanisation or wound healing in O. bicornis. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of O. bicornis, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. ¬© 2020, The Author(s)."",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-61445-w,10,1,,,,,""['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'blood cell', 'cell count', 'Cell Count', 'drug effect', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'female', 'Female', 'Hemocytes', 'hemolymph', 'Hemolymph', 'immunology', 'immunosuppressive agent', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'male', 'Male', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081579236&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-61445-w&partnerID=40&md5=27c64e7d725c3d59e59115314a2723b7,Scopus,,0,,0,269";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

To examine on-farm exposure to pesticides in invertebrate pollinators, we also collected bumble bees native to Canada (Bombus mixtus, Bombus flavifrons, and Bombus melanopygus), their pollen, and blueberry leaves and flowers from within conventionally sprayed and organic blueberry farms.

This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors. The reduced numbers of DEGs and KEGG pathways associated with the DEGs for the combined stressors compared to the stressors alone indicates that the interaction of the stressors is not additive or synergistic, but antagonistic. The possible implications of the antagonistic effect on the number of DEGs are discussed. ¬© 2020 Morfin et al.

One recurring concern is that the current frameworks may be biased towards assessing risks to the honey bee. This paradigm requires extrapolating toxicity information across bee species. Most research effort has therefore focused on quantifying differences in sensitivity across species. However, our understanding of how responses to pesticides may vary within a species is still very poor. Here we take the first steps towards filling this knowledge gap by comparing acute, lethal hazards in sexes and castes of the eusocial bee Bombus terrestris and in sexes of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis after oral and contact exposure to the pesticides sulfoxaflor, Amistar (azoxystrobin) and glyphosate. We show that sensitivity towards pesticides varies significantly both within and across species. Bee weight was a meaningful predictor of pesticide susceptibility. However, weight could not fully explain the observed differences, which suggests the existence of unexplored mechanisms regulating pesticide sensitivity across bee sexes and castes.

Increased honeybee mortality observed worldwide certainly contributes to this interest. The potential role of several neurotoxic insecticides in triggering or potentiating honeybee mortality was considered, in particular phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, given that they are widely used and highly toxic for insects. Along with their ability to kill insects at lethal doses, they can compromise survival at sublethal doses by producing subtle deleterious effects. In this study, we compared the bee's locomotor ability, which is crucial for many tasks within the hive (e.g. cleaning brood cells, feeding larvae...), before and after an acute sublethal exposure to one insecticide belonging to the two insecticide classes, fipronil and thiamethoxam. Additionally, we examined the locomotor ability after exposure to pyrethroids, an older chemical insecticide class still widely used and known to be highly toxic to bees as well. Our study focused on young bees (day 1 after emergence) since (i) few studies are available on locomotion at this stage and (ii) in recent years, pesticides have been reported to accumulate in different hive matrices, where young bees undergo their early development. At sublethal doses (SLD48h, i.e. causing nomortality at 48h), three pyrethroids, namely cypermethrin (2.5 ng/bee), tetramethrin (70 ng/bee), tau-fluvalinate (33 ng/bee) and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (3.8 ng/bee) caused a locomotor deficit in honeybees. While the SLD48h of fipronil (a phenylpyrazole, 0.5 ng/bee) had no measurable effect on locomotion, we observed high mortality several days after exposure, an effect that was not observed with the other insecticides. Although locomotor deficits observed in the sublethal range of pyrethroids and thiamethoxam would suggest deleterious effects in the field, the case of fipronil demonstrates that toxicity evaluation requires information on multiple endpoints (e.g. long term survival) to fully address pesticides risks for honeybees. Pyrethroid-induced locomotor deficits are discussed in light of recent advances regarding their mode of action on honeybee ion channels and current structure-function studies."",2015/12/14/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0144879,10,12,,,1932-6203,WOS:000366715900130,,,,,,,0,,0,273";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"195,1020,JOUR,Spinosad toxicity to pollinators and associated risk,""['Mayes, M.A.', 'Thompson, G.D.', 'Husband, B.', 'Miles, M.M.']"",Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,""Spinosad is a natural insecticide derived from an actinomycete bacterium species, Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao 1990), that displays the efficacy of a synthetic insecticide. It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2003."",2003///,2003,10.1007/0-387-21731-2_2,179,,37,71,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242371130&doi=10.1007%2f0-387-21731-2_2&partnerID=40&md5=db500ad2fa15244e47bc391f46f4601a,Scopus,,0,,0,274";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These pesticides are often applied in areas with ecological peculiarities (e.g., the Neotropical savannah-like region termed as Cerrado) that were not considered during the product development. Here, we conducted field experiments with melon (i.e., Cucumis melo L.) plants cultivated under Brazilian Cerrado conditions and evaluated the impacts of botanical (i.e., neem-based insecticide) and synthetic (i.e., the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil) pesticides on the flower visitation rates of naturally occurring pollinator bees. Our results revealed that both honey bees (i.e., Apis mellifera L) and non-Apis bees visited melon flowers and the intensity of bee visitation was moderately correlated with yield parameters (e.g., number of marketable fruits and fruit yield). Pesticide treatments differentially affected bee species. For instance, Plebeia sp. bees were not affected by any pesticide treatment, whereas both A. mellifera and Halictus sp. bees showed reduced visitation intensity after the application of deltamethrin or neem-based insecticides. Fungicide treatment alone did not influence the bee's visitation intensity. Deltamethrin-treated melon fields produced significantly lighter marketable fruits, and the melon yield was significantly lower in melon fields treated with the neem-based insecticide. Thus, our findings with such pollinator bees reinforce the idea that field applications of botanical pesticides may represent as risky as the applications of synthetic compounds, indicating that these alternative products should be submitted to risk assessments comparable to those required for synthetic products.

These chemicals were selected because they are used globally and ingested by honey bees. The sub-lethal concentration of imidacloprid reduced the activity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST).

Considering the potential threat of pesticide poisoning, the indigenous Saudi bee Apis mellifera jemenitica is susceptible to the risks associated with acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This study investigates the acetamiprid-induced effects on the survival, olfactory learning, and memory formation of A. m. jemenitica through two exposure routes: topical application and oral ingestion. Field-realistic and serially diluted concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 10 ppm) of acetamiprid led to notable mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment, with peak mortality observed at 24 h and 48 h for both exposure routes. Bee mortality was concentration-dependent, increasing with the rising concentration of acetamiprid at the tested time intervals. Food consumption following oral exposure exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern, steadily decreasing with increasing concentrations of acetamiprid. Oral exposure resulted in a substantially higher cumulative mortality (55%) compared to topical exposure (15%), indicating a significant disparity in bee mortality between the two exposure routes. The 24 h post-treatment LC50 values for acetamiprid were 160.33 and 12.76 ppm for topical application and oral ingestion, respectively. The sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of acetamiprid were 15.23, 34.18, and 61.20 ppm, respectively, following topical exposure, and 2.85, 4.77, and 6.91 ppm, respectively, following oral exposure. The sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid significantly decreased learning during the 2nd‚Äì3rd conditioning trials and impaired memory formation at 2, 12, and 24 h following both topical and oral exposure routes, compared to the control bees. Notably, the sublethal concentrations were equally effective in impairing bee learning and memory.

In the external environment bees locate food sources by the use of floral scents, while inside the hive, pheromones such as the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) and alarm pheromones serve important functions in regulating colony life and inducing aggressive responses against intruders and parasites. Widely reported alterations of various behaviors in- and outside the hive following exposure to pesticides could therefore be associated with a disturbance of odor sensitivity. In the present study, we tested the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides at field concentrations on the ability of honey bees to perceive volatiles at the very periphery of the olfactory system. Bee colonies were subjected to treatments during the summer with either Imidacloprid or Thiacloprid at sublethal concentrations. Antennal responses to apple (Malus domestica L.) flower volatiles were studied by GC-coupled electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD), and a range of volatiles, a substitute of the QMP, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were tested by electroantennography (EAG). Short-term and long-term effects of the neonicotinoid treatments were investigated on bees collected in the autumn and again in the following spring. Treatment with Thiacloprid induced changes in antennal responses to specific flower VOCs, with differing short- and long-term effects. In the short term, increased antennal responses were observed for benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are common flower volatiles but also constituents of the honey bee sting gland secretions. The treatment with Thiacloprid also affected antennal responses to the QMP and the mandibular alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. In the short term, a faster signal degeneration of the response signal to the positive control citral was recorded in the antennae of bees exposed to Thiacloprid or Imidacloprid. Finally, we observed season-related differences in the antennal responses to multiple VOCs. Altogether, our results suggest that volatile-specific alterations of antennal responses may contribute to explaining several behavioral changes previously observed in neonicotinoid-exposed bees. Treatment effects were generally more prominent in the short term, suggesting that adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure may not persist across generations.

Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees'mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees. ¬© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

We expand these assessments to include 12 species of native and non-native crop pollinators of differing levels of body size, sociality, and floral specialization. Bees were collected throughout 2016 and 2017 from flowering blueberry, squash, pumpkin, sunflower and okra in south Mississippi, USA. Within 30-60 minutes of capture, bees were installed in bioassay cages made from transparent plastic cups and dark amber jars. Bees were fed via dental wicks saturated with 27% (1.25 M) sugar syrup containing a realistic range of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 5, 20, or 100 ppb) that are often found in nectar. Bees displayed no visible tremors or convulsions except for a small sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, and only at 100ppb syrup. Imidacloprid shortened the captive longevities of the solitary bees. Tolerant bee species lived ‚àº10 to 12 days in the bioassays and included two social and one solitary species: Halictus ligatus, Apis mellifera and Ptilothrix bombiformis (rose mallow bees), respectively. No other bee species tolerated imidacloprid as well as honey bees did, which exhibited no appreciable mortality and only modest paralysis across concentration. In contrast, native bees either lived shorter lives, experienced longer paralysis, or endured both. Overall, longevity decreased with concentration linearly for social bees and non-linearly for solitary species. The percentage of a bee's captive lifespan spent paralyzed increased logarithmically with concentration for all species, although bumble bees suffered longest. Of greatest concern was comparable debilitation of agriculturally valuable solitary bees at both low and high sublethal rates of imidacloprid. ¬© 2023 Public Library of Science.

The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 mu g/L-1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program. The multifaceted, physiological response described here may be of importance to our general understanding of pollinator health.

As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling in insects, leading to neurotoxicity and are therefore globally used as insecticides. Several behavioral studies have shown links between neonicotinoid exposure of bees and adverse effects on foraging activity, homing flight performance and reproduction, but the molecular aspects underlying these effects are not well-understood. In the last years, several studies through us and others showed the effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on gene expression in the brain of honey bees. Transcripts of acetylcholine receptors, hormonal regulation, stress markers, detoxification enzymes, immune system related genes and transcripts of the energy metabolism were altered after neonicotinoid exposure. To elucidate the link between homing flight performance and shifts in gene expression in the brain of honey bees after neonicotinoid exposure, we combined homing flight activity experiments applying RFID technology and gene expression analysis. We analyzed the expression of endocrine factors, stress genes, detoxification enzymes and genes linked to energy metabolism in forager bees after homing flight experiments. Three different experiments (experiment I: pilot study";" experiment II: ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù study and experiment III: laboratory study) were performed. In a pilot study, we wanted to investigate if we could see differences in gene expression between controls and exposed bees (experiment I). This first study was followed by a so-called ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù study (experiment II), where we investigated mainly differences in the expression of transcripts linked to energy metabolism between fast and slow returning foragers. We found a correlation between homing flight duration and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, one transcript linked to oxidative phosphorylation. In the third experiment (experiment III), foragers were exposed in the laboratory to 1 ng/bee thiamethoxam and 8 ng/bee thiacloprid followed by gene expression analysis without a subsequent flight experiment. We could partially confirm the induction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, which we detected in experiment II. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the feeding mode (group feeding vs. single bee feeding) on data scattering and demonstrated that single bee feeding is superior to group feeding as it significantly reduces variability in gene expression. Based on the data, we thus hypothesize that the disruption of energy metabolism may be one reason for a prolongation of homing flight duration in neonicotinoid treated bees.

A major potential cause of decline is considered to be the interaction between environmental stressors, particularly between exposure to pesticides and pathogens. To explore pesticide‚Äìpathogen interactions in an important pollinator insect, the honey bee, we used two new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (SULF), at sublethal and field-realistic doses in a fully crossed experimental design with three common viral honey bee pathogens, Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) genotypes A and B. Through laboratory experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination to individual insects, we recorded harmful effects of FPF and pathogens on honey bee survival and immune gene expression. Though we found no evidence of synergistic interactions among stressors on either honey bee survival or viral load, the combined treatment SULF and DWV-B led to a synergistic upregulation of dicer-like gene expression.

Recently, we found that bees in a two-choice assay prefer to consume solutions containing field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiamethoxam (TMX), to sucrose alone. This suggests that neonicotinoids enhance the rewarding properties of sucrose and that low, acute doses could improve learning and memory in bees. To test this, we trained foraging-age honeybees to learn to associate floral scent with a reward containing nectar-relevant concentrations of IMD and TMX and tested their short (STM) and long-term (LTM) olfactory memories.

The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was once common in western North America, but this species has become increasingly rare through much of its range. To understand potential mechanisms driving these declines, we used Bayesian occupancy models to investigate the effects of climate and land cover from 1998 to 2020, pesticide use from 2008 to 2014, and projected expected occupancy under three future scenarios. Using 14,457 surveys across 2.8 million km2 in the western United States, we found strong negative relationships between increasing temperature and drought on occupancy and identified neonicotinoids as the pesticides of greatest negative influence across our study region. The mean predicted occupancy declined by 57% from 1998 to 2020, ranging from 15 to 83% declines across 16 ecoregions. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we found continued declines in nearly half of the ecoregions by the 2050s and mean declines of 93% under the most severe scenario across all ecoregions. This assessment underscores the tenuous future of B. occidentalis and demonstrates the scale of stressors likely contributing to rapid loss of related pollinator species throughout the globe.

Their long half-lives and high water solubility increase their potential to linger and affect numerous organisms long after application. A prominent concern associated with residual contamination is the negative impact that neonicotinoids can have on beneficial arthropods such as bees and certain groups of beetles. Many studies have looked at the effects neonicotinoids have on arthropod communities in lab settings";" however, comparatively few studies have looked at these groups in neonicotinoid-contaminated restored prairie habitats. These habitats are often restored from or located near agriculture and are almost ubiquitously contaminated with neonicotinoids. Our one-year manipulated field study compared native bee nesting rates and beetle community assemblages between paired clothianidin-contaminated and non-contaminated restored prairie plots. Native bee nesting probability and nesting abundance increased by 46% and 172%, respectively, in sites contaminated with clothianidin. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in beetle family assemblages, abundance, or richness between clothianidin-contaminated and control sites. These results suggest that neonicotinoid contamination of natural habitats can have numerous environmental consequences for arthropods and that these effects are not always consistent between taxa.

Inter-individual differences in pesticide sensitivity and/or the level of exposure (e.g., ingestion of pesticide-contaminated matrices) may explain this variability in risk posed by a pesticide. Therefore, to better inform pesticide risk assessment for honeybees, we studied the risk posed by pesticides to two behavioral castes, nurse, and forager bees, which are largely represented within colonies and which exhibit large differences in their physiological backgrounds. For that purpose, we determined the sensitivity of nurses and foragers to azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) upon acute or chronic exposure. Azoxystrobin was found to be weakly toxic to both types of bees. However, foragers were more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than nurses upon acute and chronic exposure. This phenomenon was not explained by better sulfoxaflor metabolization in nurses, but rather by differences in body weight (nurses being 1.6 times heavier than foragers). Foragers consistently consumed more sugar syrup than nurses, and this increased consumption was even more pronounced with pesticide-contaminated syrup (at specific concentrations). Altogether, the stronger susceptibility and exposure of foragers to sulfoxaflor contributed to increases of 2 and tenfold for the acute and chronic risk quotients, respectively, compared to nurses. In conclusion, to increase the safety margin and avoid an under-estimation of the risk posed by insecticides to honeybees, we recommend systematically including forager bees in regulatory tests."",2022/12//undefined,2022,10.1007/s11356-022-21969-2,29,60,90328,90337,0944-1344,WOS:000828463000005,""['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'metabolite', 'worker caste', 'safety', 'Risk quotient', 'Forager', 'Nurse', 'Pesticide metabolization', 'Pesticide sensitivity']"",,,,,,0,,0,296";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Among these insecticides, thiacloprid, a commonly used compound with low toxicity, has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on the olfactory and learning abilities of honeybees. The effect of sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid on the antennal activity of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, laboratory-based experiments were conducted in which honeybee larvae were administered thiacloprid (0.5¬†mg/L and 1.0¬†mg/L). Using electroantennography (EAG), the impacts of thiacloprid exposure on the antennal selectivity to common floral volatiles were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of sub-lethal exposure on odor-related learning and memory were also assessed. The results of this study reveal, for the first time, that sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid decreased honeybee antenna EAG responses to floral scents, leading to increased olfactory selectivity in the high-dose (1.0¬†mg/L) group compared to the control group (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.042). The results also suggest that thiacloprid negatively affected odor-associated paired learning acquisition, as well as medium-term (1¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.019) and long-term memory (24¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.037) in adult honeybees.

Our results indicated that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid may affect olfactory perception and learning and memory behaviors in honeybees.

As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation.

Ecotoxicogenomics, including transcriptomics, measures responses in individual organisms at the molecular level which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying phenotypic responses induced by one or more stressors and link impacts on individuals to populations. Here, fifth instar honey bee larvae were sampled from a previously reported field experiment exploring the phenotypic impacts of environmentally realistic chronic exposures of the pesticide imidacloprid (5 mu g.kg(-1) for six weeks) and the acaricide thymol (250 g.kg(-1) applied via Apiguard gel in-hive for four weeks), both separately and in combination. RNA-seq was used to discover individual and interactive chemical effects on larval gene expression and to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to reported adult and colony phenotypes. The separate and combined treatments had distinct gene expression profiles which represented differentially affected signaling and metabolic pathways.

However, studies comparing the toxicity of pesticides to different individuals and species are lacking, making it difficult to evaluate their short- and long-term effects on colonies and populations of these insects. In this work, we tested the lethality of compounds from the main pesticide groups on stingless bees of the species Melipona beecheii Bennett, Trigona nigra Provancher, and Nannotrigona perilampoides Cresson. The LD50 (in micrograms per bee) for each pesticide was calculated for callow workers and foragers of the three species as well as for gynes and drones of M. beecheii. The results showed that all species were highly susceptible to the evaluated compounds. Nicotinoid pesticides were the most toxic, followed in descending order by permethrin, diazinon, and methomyl. We found evidence of a relationship between the body weight of the species and their LD50 for permethrin and methomyl (r = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively) but not for diazinon (r = -0.089). An analysis of contingency tables showed that within each species, callow workers had higher mortalities than foragers (P < 0.01). In M. beecheii at similar pesticide dose more males died compared with females [œá(0.01),1 = 10.16]. However, gynes were less resistant than workers [œá(0.01),1 = 8.11].

We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana.

Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed.

Honeybees inevitably come into contact with environmental stressors that are not intended to target honeybees, such as pesticides. Although large-scale losses of honeybee colonies are thought to be associated with viruses, these viruses usually lead to covert infections and to not cause acute damage if the bees do not encounter outside stressors. To reveal the potential relationship between acute pesticides and viruses, we applied different doses of imidacloprid to adult bees that were primarily infected with low levels (4.3 √ó 105 genome copies) of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) to observe whether the acute oral toxicity of imidacloprid was able to elevate the level of CBPV. Here, we found that the titer of CBPV was significantly elevated in adult bees after 96 h of acute treatment with imidacloprid at the highest dose 66.9 ng/bee compared with other treatments and controls. Our study provides clear evidence that exposure to acute high doses of imidacloprid in honeybees persistently infected by CBPV can exert a remarkably negative effect on honeybee survival. These results imply that acute environmental stressors might be one of the major accelerators causing rapid viral replication, which may progress to cause mass proliferation and dissemination and lead to colony decline.

To test this, we investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial working memory in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, using an adaptation of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules.

The high dose caused bees to make more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the task than unexposed bees.

We treated colonies with the miticide amitraz (Apivar¬Æ), used IPM practices, or left some colonies untreated, and then measured the effect of different levels of mite infestations on the sensitivity of bees to phenothrin, amitraz, and clothianidin. Sensitivity to all insecticides varied throughout the year among and within treatment groups. Clothianidin sensitivity decreased with increasing mite levels, but no such correlation was seen with phenothrin or amitraz. These results show that insecticide sensitivity is dynamic throughout the 5 months test. In-hive amitraz treatment according to the labeled use did not synergize sensitivity to the pesticides tested and this should alleviate concern over potential synergistic effects. Since IPM practices were largely ineffective at reducing Varroa mite infestation, reliance on chemical methods of Varroa mite management is likely to continue. However, miticides must be used judiciously so the long term effectiveness of these compounds can be maximized. These data demonstrate the complex and dynamic variables that contribute to honey bee colony health. The results underscore the importance of controlling for as many of these variables as possible in order to accurately determine the effects of each of these factors as they act alone or in concert with others. ¬© 2017 by the authors";" licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."",2017///,2017,10.3390/insects8010009,8,1,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009726572&doi=10.3390%2finsects8010009&partnerID=40&md5=b790e3c5ad271f79807654c464e2e0e2,Scopus,,0,,0,316";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In worst case laboratory studies using glass plates, an intrinsic level of toxicity to predatory mites (Typhlodromus pyri) and parasitic wasps (Aphidius rhopalosiphi) was observed. In laboratory studies with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) insects either dosed topically or fed sucrose solutions containing spinosad were also adversely affected. When tested in higher tier studies (extended laboratory or semi-field), spinosad was seen to be highly selective to many important beneficial species. Spinosad when used according to good agricultural/horticultural practice, has been shown to be compatible with predatory mites (T.pyri, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius californicus), predatory heteroptera (Orius insidiosus, O. laevigatus and Macrolophus caliginosus), coccinellidae (Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septempunctata) and neuroptera (Chrysoperla cornea and C. rufibularis). Parasitic hymenoptera are particularly sensitive to spinosad. However, toxic effects are short lived due to the low persistence of spinosad. This means that species such as A. colemani can be soon introduced to a glasshouse after application (1-2 weeks). Semi-field studies with bumble bees have also been conducted. Spinosad was applied when bees were not flying. Bees were allowed to forage on the treated plants when spray deposits had dried. The findings from these studies indicated that, when used in this way, spinosad was completely safe to foraging worker bees. On inspection of the hives, it was seen that no significantly adverse effects on queen or brood had occurred. It can be concluded that spinosad is highly selective to beneficials and pollinators making it an ideal insect control product for use within glasshouse IPM programmes."",2000///,2000,,65,,393,400,0368-9697,WOS:000169941300045,,,,,,,0,,0,318";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure.

"100,961,JOUR,Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees,""['Williamson, S.M.', 'Wright, G.A.']"",Journal of Experimental Biology,""Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes. ¬© 2013.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing"; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province;" yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators."",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449,461,,,,,,,0,,0,325";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition, four honey bee cohorts were fed imidacloprid in the laboratory ad libitum for several weeks and were analyzed by RT-qPCR for gene expression. Pesticides were identified at different concentrations in both crop flowers and recovered foragers. No significant differences in foragers‚Äô mortality were found among locations. Acetylcholinesterase and detoxification genes showed no response to exposure to pesticides except for GstS3 and GstS4. Our results suggest that none of the studied genes make suitable biomarkers for honey bee exposed to pesticides. ¬© 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France."",2017///,2017,10.1007/s13592-017-0497-3,48,4,556,571,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021759862&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-017-0497-3&partnerID=40&md5=51c972ef02bdd77c28413ab930d7403d,Scopus,,0,,0,329";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"61,515,JOUR,Using the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,""['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']"",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,""One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription‚Äìquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (<1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled significantly increased. These results demonstrate the variation arising from the genetic background and physiological transitions in honey bees as they age. This information can be used to determine risk assessment, as well as establishing baseline data for future comparisons to explain the variation in toxicity differences for honey bees reported in the literature."",2015///,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0139841,10,10,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947239108&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0139841&partnerID=40&md5=cdb88d4cc0743af1a5bbc905936a06ac,Scopus,,0,,0,332";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"2,606,JOUR,Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees,""['Tsvetkov, N.', 'Zayed, A.']"",Ecology and Evolution,""Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a ‚Äústreetlight effect‚Äù where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways";" foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated";" and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress.

High average annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US have been partially attributed to agrochemical exposure and virus infections. To examine the potential negative synergistic impacts of agrochemical exposure and virus infection, as well as the potential promise of phytochemicals to ameliorate the impact of pathogenic infections on honey bees, we infected bees with a panel of viruses (i.e., Flock House virus, deformed wing virus, or Sindbis virus) and exposed to one of three chemical compounds. Specifically, honey bees were fed sucrose syrup containing: (1) thyme oil, a phytochemical and putative immune stimulant, (2) fumagillin, a beekeeper applied fungicide, or (3) clothianidin, a grower-applied insecticide. We determined that virus abundance was lower in honey bees fed 0.16 ppm thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup, compared to bees fed sucrose syrup alone. Parallel analysis of honey bee gene expression revealed that honey bees fed thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup had higher expression of key RNAi genes (argonaute-2 and dicer-like), antimicrobial peptide expressing genes (abaecin and hymenoptaecin), and vitellogenin, a putative honey bee health and age indicator, compared to bees fed only sucrose syrup. Virus abundance was higher in bees fed fumagillin (25 ppm or 75 ppm) or 1 ppb clothianidin containing sucrose syrup relative to levels in bees fed only sucrose syrup. Whereas, honey bees fed 10 ppb clothianidin had lower virus levels, likely because consuming a near lethal dose of insecticide made them poor hosts for virus infection. The negative impact of fumagillin and clothianidin on honey bee health was indicated by the lower expression of argonaute-2, dicer-like, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin, and vitellogenin. Together, these results indicate that chemical stimulants and stressors impact the outcome of virus infection and immune gene expression in honey bees.

We studied the impact of different experimental setups by varying the number of bees, age of bees, origin of bees, duration of experiment, the amount of available diet, and the influence of the neurotoxic pesticide imidacloprid in the diet on the feeding and food sharing behavior (trophallaxis). Sugar solution was non-uniformly distributed in bees in 36 out of 135 cages. As a measure of the extent to which the sugar diet was equally distributed between caged bees, we calculated the (inner 80%) intake ratio by dividing the intake of the 90th percentile bee by the intake of the 10th percentile bee. This intake ratio ranged from 1.3 to 94.8 in 133 individual cages, further supporting a non-uniform distribution of food among caged bees. We can expect a cage with 10 or 30 bees containing one bee that ingests, on average, the 8.8-fold of the bee in the same cage ingesting the smallest quantity of food. Inner 80% intake ratios were lower in experiments with a permanent or chronic offering of labelled sugar solution compared to temporary or acute feedings. After pooling the data of replicates to achieve a higher statistical power we compared different experimental setups. We found that uniform food distribution is best approached with 10 newly emerged bees per cage, which originate from a brood comb from a single colony. We also investigated the trophallaxis between caged honey bees which originally consumed the diet and newly added bees. Color marked bees were starved and added to the cages in a ratio of 10:5 or 20:20 after the initial set of bees consumed all the labelled sugar solution. The distribution of the labelled sugar solution by trophallaxis within 48 hours to added bees was 25% (10:5) or 45% (20:20) of the initial sugar solution. Imidacloprid at its median lethal dose (LD50) in the sugar solution reduced this post-feeding food transmission to 27% (20:20). Our results show that differences in food intake exist within caged bees that may lead to differential exposure that can influence the interpretation of toxicity tests. ¬© 2017 Brodschneider et al.

However, little is known about the physiological effects of sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate exposure on bumblebees. We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5¬†mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10¬†days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, Œ±-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut Œ±-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activity of prophenoloxidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition. Our results provide information on the sublethal effects of exposure to low concentrations of glyphosate and spinetoram on bumblebees in terms of physiology and gut microbes.

Many factors have contributed to pollinator declines including habitat loss, climate change, disease and parasitism, reductions in abundance and diversity of foraging resources, and agrochemical exposure. Particulate matter (PM) serves as a carrier of toxic agrochemicals, and pollinator mortality can occur following exposure to agrochemical-contaminated PM. Therefore, laboratory-controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate impacts of individual PM-bound agrochemicals. Honeybees (Apis mellifera), blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria), and painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) larvae were exposed to bifenthrin, permethrin, clothianidin, imidacloprid, abamectin, and ivermectin via suspended, airborne PM. Agrochemical concentrations in PM to which pollinators were exposed were based on concentrations observed in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM including a ‚Äúmean‚Äù treatment and a ‚Äúmax‚Äù treatment reflective of reported mean and maximum PM-bound agrochemical concentrations, respectively. In general, pollinators in the mean and max treatments experienced significantly higher mortality compared with controls. Honeybees were most sensitive to pyrethroids, mason bees were most sensitive to neonicotinoids, and painted lady butterfly larvae were most sensitive to macrocyclic lactones. Overall, pollinator mortality was quite low relative to established toxic effect levels derived from traditional pollinator contact toxicity tests. Furthermore, pollinator mortality resulting from exposure to individual agrochemicals via PM was less than that reported to occur at beef cattle feedyards, highlighting the importance of mixture toxicity to native and managed pollinator survival and conservation.

However, the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is widely distributed throughout Asia, and toxicity data are lacking for this species. This study aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. In this study, we determined the acute contact toxicity in A. cerana to various pesticides, including neonicotinoids, fipronil, organophosphorus, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamate, and anthranilic diamide. Based on the test duration of 48 h of contact LD50 tests, A. cerana was most sensitive to dinotefuran (0.0014 lg/bee), followed by thiamethoxam (0.0024 lg/bee) and fipronil (0.0025 lg/bee). Dinotefuran is used extensively in Asia, thereby potentially creating a substantial hazard. More generally, A. cerana was approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than was A. mellifera to most of the pesticides evaluated.

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control.

Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates. ¬© 2020.

Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3‚Ä≤(2‚Ä≤), 5‚Ä≤-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq.

"115,632,JOUR,Extrapolating Acute Contact Bee Sensitivity to Insecticides Based on Body Weight Using a Phylogenetically Informed Interspecies Scaling Framework,""['Pamminger, T.']"",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,""Plant protection products, including insecticides, are important for global food production but can have adverse effects on nontarget organisms including bees. Historically, research investigating such effects has focused mainly on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), whereas less information is available for non-Apis bees. Consequently, a comprehensive hazard (sensitivity) assessment for the majority of bees is lacking, which in turn hinders accurate risk characterization and consequently bee protection. Interspecies sensitivity extrapolation based on body weight might be a way to improve the situation, but in the past such approaches often ignored the phylogenetic background of the species used, which in turn potentially reduces the robustness of such results. Published acute contact sensitivity data (median lethal dose per bee) of bees to insecticides, their body weight, and their phylogenetic background were used to build interspecies scaling models to predict bee sensitivity based on their weight. The results indicate that 1) bee body weight is a predictor of acute contact bee sensitivity to a range of insecticides, and 2) phylogeny (nonindependence of data points) needs to be considered in cross-species analysis, although it does not always confound the observed effects.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006‚Äì0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003‚Äì0.0006) Œºg active ingredient (a.i.) bee‚àí1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata.

Toxicity information for a variety of species is documented and utilized, environmental concentrations estimated, and risk characterizations in the form of risk quotients are quantified. Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict offsite transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species.

We acquired 1-day-old, 20-day-old, and 2-year-old queens and 1-day-old and 20-day-old workers (foragers) fed 0, 5, or 200 ppb imidacloprid, a pesticide oxidative stressor. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase and the level of total antioxidant potential were determined in hemolymph. The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

In the current study, we evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53, 13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) of spinosad (formulation), and the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied. The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) reduced the survival of workers during development. Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium. Finally, the chronic exposure of larvae to 32.64 ng. a.i. bee(-1) spinosad also altered the remodeling of the midgut during metamorphosis and affected the organization of the PM of larvae, pupae, and adults.

At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. ¬© 2017 Tesovnik et al.

In the last years, several studies have reported severe secondary effects on various bee species, including exotic and native bees. In this study, lethal (mortality) and sublethal (locomotor activity) effects of insecticides and acaricides used in strawberries in Brazil (abamectin, novaluron, spinetoram, and thiamethoxam) were evaluated on the native stingless beesMelipona quadrifasciataandTetragonisca fiebrigi. The results showed that the effects varied significantly according to the pesticide, type of exposure (oral or topical), and bee species. Through oral exposure,M. quadrifasciatawas more susceptible to all insecticides except for abamectin, while in topical exposure,T. fiebrigiwas more sensitive. Thiamethoxam followed by spinetoram and abamectin were the most lethal, regardless of species or exposure route";" novaluron was not harmful at the highest tested dose. The locomotor activity of bees was altered in the presence of sublethal doses (LC(10)and LC50) of all insecticides. Spinetoram and abamectin can be as much as toxic as thiamethoxam againstM. quadrifasciataandT. fiebrigiin laboratory experiments.

Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group.

While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid ‚Äì IMI or thiamethoxam ‚Äì THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), Œ±-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (Œ±-carotene and Œ±-cryptoxanthin) and Œ±-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees.

Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees.

Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal mechanism that may account for the cognitive impairments caused by neonicotinoids, and predict that exposure to multiple pesticides that target cholinergic signalling will cause enhanced toxicity to pollinators."",2013/03//undefined,2013,10.1038/ncomms2648,4,,,,2041-1723,WOS:000318873900087,,,,,,,0,,0,379";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation.

When worker bees were exposed to temperatures of 4, 27, 40, 45 and 50. ¬∞C for 1. h, decreased survival occurred only at 50. ¬∞C.

Artificial ingestion of two flower-thinning agents containing either 0.1% boron and zinc, or 1% sulfur increased hsp70 and grp78 levels at different rates without affecting hsp40 and hsp90 levels, and had no effect on workers' mortality. However, ingestion of imidacloprid solution (0.5-50. ppm) increased mortality in workers and decreased the levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner.

A wide variety of insecticides are used to manage D. citri populations within citrus groves in Florida. However, in areas shared by citrus growers and beekeepers the use of insecticides may increase the risks of Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) loss and contaminated honey. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri. Diflubenzuron was not toxic to A. mellifera in the field as compared with untreated control plots. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity of A. mellifera was higher than in untreated controls when A. mellifera were exposed to 14 days old residues.

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees.

Through Xylidine Ponceau technique, we found cells which stained more intensely in groups exposed to thiamethoxam. The digestive and regenerative cells of the midgut from exposed bees also showed morphological and histochemical alterations, like cytoplasm vacuolization, increased apocrine secretion and increased cell elimination.

For example, recent work has shown that cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this, exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration. Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. ¬© 2019 Beadle et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/."",2019///,2019,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007903,15,2,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061562980&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1007903&partnerID=40&md5=2e2bbb319513299a2211bd88ed4c830a,Scopus,,0,,0,387";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

"0,921,JOUR,The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation,""['Zhang, E.', 'Nieh, J.C.']"",Journal of Experimental Biology,""Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory - cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 Œºg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 Œºg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. ¬© 2015.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 ¬µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells.

The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl).

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2√ó deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa.

The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar. The initial flight phase controlled by the recently acquired navigation memory (vector memory) was less compromised than the second phase that leads the animal back to the hive (homing flight). The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory.

In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8-10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4-7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation.

This raises the question of whether data for honey bees are a good proxy for other bee species. This issue is not new and has resulted in several publications in which the sensitivity of bee species is compared based on the values of the 48-h median lethal dose (LD50) from acute test results. When this approach is used, observed differences in sensitivity may result both from differences in kinetics and from inherent differences in species sensitivity. In addition, the physiology of the bee, like its overall size, the size of the honey stomach (for acute oral tests), and the physical appearance (for acute contact tests) also influences the sensitivity of the bee. The recently introduced Toxicokinetic‚ÄìToxicodynamic (TKTD) model that was developed for the interpretation of honey bee tests (Bee General Uniform Threshold Model for Survival [BeeGUTS]) could integrate the results of acute oral tests, acute contact tests, and chronic tests within one consistent framework. We show that the BeeGUTS model can be calibrated and validated for other bee species and also that the honey bee is among the more sensitive bee species. In addition, we found that differences in sensitivity between species are smaller than previously published comparisons based on 48-h LD50 values. The time-dependency of the LD50 and the specifics of the bee physiology are the main causes of the wider variation found in the published literature.

However, the validity of using A. mellifera as a surrogate for other Apis and non-Apis bees in pesticide risk assessment has been questioned. Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear. Here we used a phylogenomic approach to identify > 100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families. Functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species revealed that P450-mediated detoxification of certain systemic insecticides, including the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the butenolide flupyradifurone, is conserved across all major bee pollinator families. However, our analyses also reveal that CYP9Q-related genes are not universal to all bee species, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes. Thus, our results reveal an evolutionary conserved capacity to metabolize certain insecticides across all major bee families while identifying a small number of bee species where this function may have been lost. Furthermore, they illustrate the potential of a toxicogenomic approach to inform pesticide risk assessment for nonmanaged bee species by predicting the capability of bee pollinator species to break down synthetic insecticides. copyright ¬© 2022 the Author(s)."",2022///,2022,10.1073/pnas.2205850119,119,26,,,,,""['animal', 'animal cell', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee pollination', 'Bees', 'biochemical analysis', 'bioinformatics', 'Biological Evolution', 'butenolide', 'controlled study', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'cytochrome P450 family 3', 'detoxification', 'evolution', 'gene identification', 'gene locus', 'gene sequence', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic conservation', 'genetics', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Megachilidae', 'metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'orthology', 'P450', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'phylogenomics', 'phylogeny', 'Phylogeny', 'pollinator', 'prediction', 'risk assessment', 'species identification', 'synteny', 'thiacloprid', 'toxicogenomics']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132610042&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.2205850119&partnerID=40&md5=579780eeca3117a78142229699456780,Scopus,,0,,0,407";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before.

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2‚Äì5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species.

Honey bees are damaged by destructive parasitic mites, but they also have evolved a behavioral immune system to remove them. Exposures to neonicotinoids, however, can cause significant behavioral effects because these compounds alter the central role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in insect brains. In this study, we assessed the effects of three neonicotinoids that have a high toxicity to bees‚Äîimidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin‚Äîon the behavioral immune system of honey bees. We used A. mellifera and the endoparasitic mite Acarapis woodi as a behavioral immune system model because A. mellifera can effectively remove the mite by autogrooming. Our results did not demonstrate an effect of neonicotinoid application on whether bees show autogrooming or on mite removal, but the time to initial autogrooming became shorter and the number of autogrooming attempts increased. As opposed to previous studies, our findings indicate that the honey bee response to parasitic mites becomes more sensitive after exposure to neonicotinoids.

In the current study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honeybee larvae in vitro and explored the mechanism of toxicity. The results showed that the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of S-dinotefuran to honeybee larvae was 30.0 Œºg/larva after oral exposure for 72 h, which was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran (92.7 Œºg/larva) and R-dinotefuran (183.6 Œºg/larva). Although the acute toxicity of the three forms of dinotefuran to larvae was lower than that to adults, chronic exposure significantly reduced larval survival, larval weight, and weight of newly emerged adults. Analysis of gene expression and hormone titer indicated that dinotefuran affects larval growth and development by interfering with nutrient digestion and absorption and the molting system. Analysis of hemolymph metabolome further revealed that disturbances in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and energy metabolism are the key mechanisms of dinotefuran toxicity to bee larvae. In addition, melatonin and vitellogenin are used by larvae to cope with dinotefuran-induced oxidative stress.

We tested six different concentrations of spinosad for the first two analyses, followed by LC50 (7.7 mg L-1) for other assays. Spinosad ingestion decreased survival and food consumption. Exposure to spinosad LC50 reduced flight capacity, respiration rate, and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, this concentration increased glutathione S-transferase activity and the TAC of the brain. Notably, exposure to LC50 damaged mushroom bodies, reduced the total hemocyte count and granulocyte number, and increased the number of prohemocytes. These findings imply that the neurotoxin spinosad affects various crucial functions and tissues important for bee performance and that the toxic effects are complex and detrimental to individual homeostasis."",2023/05//undefined,2023,10.1007/s11356-023-27143-6,30,25,66923,66935,0944-1344,WOS:001032043900017,""['animal', 'Animals', 'antioxidant', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Cell death', 'Cellular immune system', 'detoxification', 'drug combination', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enzymatic activity', 'enzyme activity', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'macrolide', 'Macrolides', 'mushroom', 'pollination', 'spinosad', 'survival', 'Total antioxidant capacity', 'Toxicological assessment', 'toxicological phenomena']"",,,,,,0,,0,425";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In all exposed groups, alone and in combination, the number of cells expressing caspase-3 increased, but the TLR4 number of cells expressing decreased compared to the control groups. The intensity of HSP70 immunolabeling increased compared to the control groups. However, the intensity of the immunolabeling of HSP90 decreased in the IMD, GLY, and I + G (IMD + GLY) groups but increased in I +P -exposed bees (IMD + PYR). Alternatively, exposure to PYR and P + G (PYR + GLY) did not affect the immunolabeling intensity.

In this study, we investigated the effects of stereoisomeric dinotefuran on honeybee social behavior. We found that honeybees exhibit a preference for consuming food containing S-dinotefuran, actively engage in trophallaxis with S-dinotefuran‚Äìconsuming peers, and consequently acquire higher levels of S-dinotefuran compared with R-dinotefuran. In comparison to R-dinotefuran, S-dinotefuran stimulates honeybees to elevate their body temperature, thereby attracting more peers for trophallaxis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of thermogenesis pathways due to S-dinotefuran exposure. Additionally, metabolome data indicated that S-dinotefuran may enhance body temperature by promoting lipid synthesis in the lysine degradation pathway. Consequently, body temperature emerges as a key factor influencing honeybee social behavior. Our study is the first to highlight the propensity of S-dinotefuran to raise honeybee body temperature, which prompts honeybee to preferentially engage in trophallaxis with peers exhibiting higher body temperatures. This preference may lead honeybees to collect more dinotefuran-contaminated food in the wild, significantly accelerating dinotefuran transmission within a population. Proactive trophallaxis further amplifies the risk of neonicotinoid pesticide transmission within a population, making honeybees that have consumed S-dinotefuran particularly favored within their colonies. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the higher risk associated with neonicotinoid use compared with other pesticides. ¬© 2023"",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.pestbp.2023.105594,196,,,,,,""['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'dinotefuran', 'Dinotefuran enantiomer', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'Honeybees', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Social behavior', 'Thermogenesis pathway', 'Transcriptomic and metabolome']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171593234&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2023.105594&partnerID=40&md5=57ef4a690eba7dc013b00e77a4ca3ae7,Scopus,,0,,0,436";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity"; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae);" and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data.

Research carried out on honeybees indicates that application of pesticides has a significant impact on the core gut community, which ultimately leads to an increase in the growth of harmful pathogens. Disturbances caused by pesticides also affect the way bacterial members interact, which results in gut microbial dysbiosis. Administration of beneficial microbes has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating or preventing disease in honeybees. The objective of this study was to measure under in vivo conditions the ability of two bacterial strains (the Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea sp.) isolated from honeybee gut to improve survival and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in honeybees exposed to a sublethal clothianidin dose (0.1 ppb). Both gut bacterial strains were selected for their ability to degrade clothianidin in vitro regardless of their host-microbe interaction characteristics (e.g., beneficial, neutral, or harmful). To this end, we conducted cage trials on 4- to 6-day-old newly emerging honeybees. During microbial administration, we jointly monitored the taxonomic distribution and activity level of bacterial symbionts quantifying 16S rRNA transcripts. First, curative administration of the Pantoea sp. strain significantly improved the survival of clothianidin-exposed honeybees compared to sugar control bees (i.e., supplemented with sugar [1:1]). Second, curative administration of the Enterobacter sp. strain significantly mitigated the clothianidin-induced dysbiosis observed in the midgut structural network, but without improving survival. IMPORTANCE: The present work suggests that administration of bacterial strains isolated from honeybee gut may promote recovery of gut microbiota homeostasis after prolonged clothianidin exposure, while improving survival. This study highlights that gut bacterial strains hold promise for developing efficient microbial formulations to mitigate environmental pesticide exposure in honeybee colonies."",2024///,2024,10.1128/spectrum.00578-24,12,10,e0057824,,,,""['animal', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'bee', 'Bees', 'beneficial microbes', 'classification', 'clothianidin', 'drug effect', 'dysbiosis', 'Dysbiosis', 'Enterobacter', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'genetics', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'homeostasis', 'Homeostasis', 'honeybee', 'host microbe interaction', 'Host Microbial Interactions', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'intestine flora', 'isolation and purification', 'microbiology', 'microbiota', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Pantoea', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'RNA 16S', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'symbiosis', 'Symbiosis', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205741117&doi=10.1128%2fspectrum.00578-24&partnerID=40&md5=35d55c356fb74e953dd6fb4e2f4d192a,Scopus,,0,,0,442";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 Œºg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance.

NEOCs impair detoxification abilities through reduced glutathione S-transferase activity, as well as disturb immune response due to decreased prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities, which can explain the high toxicity of these substances to honey bees. ¬© 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature."",2022///,2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00959-w,53,4,,,,,""['acetylcholinesterase (AChE)', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (composition)', 'enzyme activity', 'honeybee', 'immune response', 'neonicotinoids (NEOCs)', 'oxidative status', 'oxidative stress', 'phenoloxidase (POx)', 'prophenoloxidase (proPOx)', 'sublethal effect', 'thiacloprid', 'toxicity', 'toxicity test']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136023439&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-022-00959-w&partnerID=40&md5=48eb962176b4dcc8faeb196b50ae3f85,Scopus,,0,,0,449";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the response of the stingless bee Nannotrigona aff. testaceicornis (Lepeletier, 1836) to a promising source of new insecticide molecules obtained from Lippia sidoides (rosemary pepper) essential oil (EO) and its major compounds (thymol, œÅ-cymene, and (E)-caryophyllene), comparing them to commercial insecticides (organosynthetic: imidacloprid, deltamethrin and semisynthetic: spinetoram). For this, stingless bees were exposed by contact with these compounds to evaluate the lethal and sublethal (locomotion and flight orientation) toxicity. The L. sidoides EO and its major compounds have low lethal toxicity to forager worker bees (N. aff. testaceicornis). The organosynthetics imidacloprid (LD50 = 0.00146 ¬µg bee‚àí1) and deltamethrin (LD50 = 0.0096 ¬µg bee‚àí1) were about 209,589 and 31,875 times more toxic, respectively, than the least toxic natural compound, (E)-caryophyllene (LD50 = 306 ¬µg bee‚àí1). Locomotion ability and flight orientation were little affected by spinetoram and by L. sidoides EO and its major compounds, however, were greatly reduced by the imidacloprid and deltamethrin insecticides. Besides shows low lethal and sublethal toxicity, the bioinsecticides were also avoided by the forager bees. Individuals treated with the L. sidoides EO and thymol were avoided by the untreated bees. Therefore, the natural products studied here were promising due to their recognized effectiveness against pest insects and greater safety to bees N. aff. testaceicornis. ¬© 2020 The Authors"",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111764,209,,,,,,""['animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bioinsecticide', 'caryophyllene', 'comparative study', 'controlled study', 'deltamethrin', 'essential oil', 'forager', 'Hexapoda', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Laboratories', 'laboratory', 'laboratory method', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Lippia sidoides', 'locomotion', 'Locomotion', 'macrolide', 'Macrolides', 'Meliponinae', 'Meliponini', 'Nannotrigona', 'Nannotrigona testaceicornis', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nitrile', 'Nitriles', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'Oils, Volatile', 'para cymene', 'Pepper-rosmarin', 'physiology', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'rosemary', 'Rosmarinus officinalis', 'spinetoram', 'stingless bee', 'Stingless bee', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effect', 'thymol', 'toxicology', 'Toxicology']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097635727&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111764&partnerID=40&md5=f03141a6fd7bcf8c1e65d02ee945455a,Scopus,,0,,0,450";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Here we focused on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata and asked if the widely used neonicotinoid imidacloprid disrupts its learning and memory capabilities. We fed stingless bees with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 ng of imidacloprid, tested their innate appetitive responsiveness and trained them to associate odors and sucrose reward using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. The same experiments were performed on Africanized honey bees. One hour after intoxication, both species decreased their innate responsiveness to sucrose but the effect was more accentuated in stingless bees.

"35,549,JOUR,Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica,""['Syama, P.S.', 'Sreeranjit Kumar, C.V.']"",Sociobiology,""Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. ¬© 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

The distribution of acetamiprid and its metabolites was monitored over a 72-h period in six biological compartments: head, thorax, abdomen, haemolymph, midgut and rectum. Honeybees were treated orally with 100 Œºg [14C]-acetamiprid kg-1 bee, a dose which is about 1500 times lower than the median lethal dose. After 72 h, only 40% of the total radioactivity was eliminated, suggesting that acetamiprid and its metabolites tended to persist in the honeybee. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed in all compartments and metabolized. Just after administration, radioactivity was mainly localized in the abdomen and subsequently in the rectum. After 72 h, the maximum amount of radioactivity (about 20% of the ingested dose) was detected again in the abdomen, whereas the lowest level of total radioactivity was detected in the haemolymph. Radioactivity in the head did not exceed 7.6% of total ingested radioactivity. More than 50% of acetamiprid was metabolised in less than 30 min, indicating a very short half-life for the compound. During the first hours, acetamiprid was mainly detected in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues: abdomen, thorax and head. Of the seven metabolites detected, the major ones were 6-choronicotinic acid and an unknown metabolite called U1, which was present mainly in the rectum, the thorax and the head.

The high-throughput small RNA-sequencing was used to analyze global miRNA expression profile changes in honeybees orally exposed to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid (20 mg/L and 4 mg/L) for 72 h. Thiacloprid at 20 mg/L had no observed adverse effects. In addition, bees were fed with miRNA mimics or inhibitors to increase or decrease ame-miR-283‚Äì5p expression, and its effects on P450 gene expression (CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3) were examined. Thiacloprid susceptibility was also detected. The results showed that treatment with thiacloprid at 20 mg/L and 4 mg/L induced 11 and five differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the DEMs are mainly involved in the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, nerve conduction, and behavior. ame-miR-283‚Äì5p was downregulated by both concentrations, which was validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis. Enhancing ame-miR-283‚Äì5p expression significantly inhibited CYP9Q2 mRNA and protein expression, and increased thiacloprid toxicity, while reducing ame-miR-283‚Äì5p expression significantly promoted CYP9Q2 expression, and decreased thiacloprid susceptibility.

Changes in the immune response may hinder insects more susceptible to diseases and increase the risk of pathogen infection and pest resistance. We found that imidacloprid and amitraz alter the oxidative response of insect hemocytes at different concentrations of the immune stimulator, zymosan A. There is a differential effect of imidacloprid and amitraz on hemocytes of insects from different orders and their effect on oxidative response in insects persists beyond the point of early contact with zymosan A. Invertebrates have a diverse immune system that responds differently to stressors such as pesticides and pathogens, which leads to different degrees of susceptibility. Honeybees are facing a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder which is attributed to several factors including pesticides and pathogens. We applied an in vitro approach to assess the response of immune-activated hemocytes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Mamestra brassicae after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz. Hemocytes were exposed to the pesticides in single and co-exposures using zymosan A for immune activation. We measured the effect of these exposures on cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production from 15 to 120 min and on extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production after 3 h to assess potential alterations in the oxidative response. Our results indicate that NO and H2O2 production is more altered in honeybee hemocytes compared to D. melanogaster and M. brassicae cell lines. There is also a differential production at different time points after pesticide exposure between these insect species as contrasting effects were evident with the oxidative responses in hemocytes. The results imply that imidacloprid and amitraz act differently on the immune response among insect orders and may render honeybee colonies more susceptible to infection and pests."",2023/02//undefined,2023,10.3390/insects14020174,14,2,,,2075-4450,WOS:000939059500001,""['humoral response', 'inflammatory response', 'insects', 'invertebrate immunity', 'neonicotinoids', 'pesticides']"",,,,,,0,,0,460";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. ¬© 2022 Kim et al.

The presence of these P450s, belonging or closely related to the CYP9Q subfamily (CYP9Q-related), is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees. However, the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, lacks CYP9Q-related P450s and is 170‚Äì2500 times more sensitive to certain insecticides than bee pollinators with these P450s. The extent to which these findings apply to other Megachilidae bee species remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four Megachile species and leveraged the data obtained, in combination with publicly available genomic data, to investigate the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae. Our analyses reveal that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-related genes. In place of these genes Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage.

In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees.

However, they are less studied than managed bees, mainly regarding the harmful effects of pesticides present in agroecosystems commonly visited by them. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of residual doses of imidacloprid and pyraclostrobin, alone and in combination, on the fat body (a multifunctional organ) of the neotropical solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes by means of morphological and histochemical evaluation of oenocytes and trophocytes. Males and females of newly-emerged adults were submitted to bioassays of acute topical exposure. Experimental groups were essayed: control (CTR), solvent control (ACT), imidacloprid (IMI, 0.0028 ng/ŒºL), pyraclostrobin (PYR, 2.7 ng/ŒºL) and imidacloprid + pyraclostrobin (I + P). The data demonstrated that the residual doses applied in T. diversipes adults are sublethal at 96 h. Both oenocytes and trophocytes cells responded to topical exposure to the pesticides, showing morphological changes. In the IMI group, the bee oenocytes showed the greatest proportion of vacuolization and altered nuclei. The pyraclostrobin exposure increased the intensity of PAS-positive labeling (glycogen) in trophocytes. This increase was also observed in the I + P group. Changes in energy reserve (glycogen) of trophocytes indicate a possible mobilization impairment of this neutral polysaccharide to the hemolymph, which can compromise the fitness of exposed individuals. Also, changes in oenocytes can compromise the detoxification function performed by the fat body. This is the first study to show sublethal effects in neotropical solitary bees and highlight the importance of studies with native bees. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd"",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119140,304,,,,,,""['adult', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bioassay', 'biological marker', 'body fat', 'cell structure', 'cell vacuole', 'cells by function', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'ecotoxicology', 'Fat body', 'Fat Body', 'fat pad', 'female', 'Female', 'fungicide', 'glycogen', 'Glycogen', 'Harmful effects', 'hemolymph', 'histochemistry', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'male', 'morphology', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Neotropical bee', 'Neotropical Region', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'nontarget organism', 'oenocyte', 'Oenocyte', 'Oenocytes', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'polysaccharide', 'pyrachlostrobin', 'pyraclostrobin', 'qualitative analysis', 'quantitative analysis', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'survival analysis', 'Topical exposures', 'trophocyte', 'Trophocytes', 'unclassified drug']"",,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126832056&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2022.119140&partnerID=40&md5=3729d548adcc2a598568c2085d641e33,Scopus,,0,,0,473";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The relationship between the oil-water partition coefficient (logP) and the bee-toxicity of commercial nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) competitive modulators was explored in this work. Compared compounds with a high bee-toxicity, compounds with low bee-toxicity were found to have higher logP values. Therefore, two series of novel butenolide derivatives with different hydrophobic groups were designed and synthesized by including different hydrophobic groups. The insecticidal activity study showed that compounds I-01 (LC50=112.96 Œºg/mL), II-05 (LC50=124.68 Œºg/mL), and II-11 (LC50=87.89 Œºg/mL) were with higher insecticidal activity against Aphis glycines and lower calculated logP values among all synthesized compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that three butenolide compounds formed some hydrogen bonding or œÄ-œÄ stacking interactions with insect acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). In addition, the bee-toxicity bioassay also showed that compounds I-01, II-05 and II-11 were with much lower contact bee-toxicity than imidacloprid.

In this study, the nAChR Œ±1 subunit from Apis mellifera was first found to be narrowly tuned to different bee toxicity insecticides, namely, sulfoxaflor (SFX) and flupyradifurone (FPF). Hence, novel sulfoximine derivatives 7a-h were rationally designed and synthesized by introducing a benzo[d][1,3]dioxole moiety into a unique sulfoximine skeleton based on the binding cavity characteristics of AmelŒ±1/ratŒ≤2. The two electrode voltage clamp responses of 7a-h were obviously lower than that of SFX, indicating their potentially low bee toxicity. Besides, representative compounds 7b and 7g exhibited low bee toxicity (LD50 > 11.0 Œºg/bee at 48 h) revealed by acute contact toxicity bioassays. Molecular modelling results indicated that Ile152, Ala151, and Val160 from honeybee subunit AmelŒ±1 and Lys144 and Trp80 from aphid subunit MpŒ±1 may be crucial for bee toxicity and aphicidal activity, respectively. These results clarify the toxic mechanism of agonist insecticides on nontargeted pollinators and reveal novel scaffold sulfoximine aphicidal candidates with low bee toxicity.

The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids. These findings on the diverse mode of action for neonicotinoids to target and non-target receptor would be helpful for on novel insecticides design with high bioactivity as well as good selectivity based on the structure of different insect nAChR.

Foraging bees were exposed to different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0.01-, 0.02-, 0.04-, 0.1-, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24¬†h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance.

This is critical for understanding their responses to, and defenses against, a variety of environmental stresses, including agrochemicals. Therefore, we studied the detoxification and immune responses of a stingless bee, Nanotrigona perilampoides, which is an important stingless bee that is widely distributed throughout Mexico, including urban areas, and has the potential to be used in commercial pollination. We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/¬µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/¬µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days.

Results indicated that nitenpyram exposure decreased the survival and food consumption of honey bees. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that nitenpyram caused significant alterations in the relative abundance of several key gut microbiotas, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis and immunity. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis, we identified a total of 526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly altered between nitenpyram-treated and control honey bee gut, including several genes related to metabolic, detoxification and immunity.

However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the AmelŒ≤1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of AmelŒ±9 and AmelŒ≤2, and down-regulation of AmelŒ±1, AmelŒ±3 and AmelŒ±7 subunits.

We obtained the mean lethal concentration (LC50) and the mean survival of workers after exposure to toxic bait formulations. In the field, we carried out attraction and repellency tests of toxic baits to foraging. The food lures associated with malathion and spinosad showed different levels of toxicity to P. emerina and T. fiebrigi. Sugarcane molasses and Samarita Tradicional (R) associated with spinosad showed high toxicity, with LC50 values of 6.92 and 10.61 ng/mu L diet to P. emerina, and of 4.37 and 15.48 ng/mu L diet to T. fiebrigi, respectively. Gelsura (R) and food lures with malathion caused rapid workers mortality, with mean survival less than 3 h after exposure. No toxic bait formulation was attractive to P. emerina foragers in the field.

The structure-activity relationships of acetamiprid homologues and 3-pyridylmethylamines (known as the essential structural requirement of nicotinoid) are compared in terms of the affinity to the [H-3]alpha- bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT) site (designated as ACh site) and the [H-3]phencyclidine (PCP) site [designated as noncompetitive blocker (NCB) site] of the insect nAChR from the honeybee heads. Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [H-3]alpha-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [H-3]PCP binding in the insect nAChR. Scatchard analysis reveals that homologues of acetamiprid and 3-pyridylmethylamine having n-butyl substituents interact with the high-affinity binding site for [H-3]PCP, which is considered to be the NCB site located in the ion channel of the insect nAChR.

The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI).

Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites.

However, the roles of PDIA6 in Apis cerana cerana are poorly understood. Herein, we obtained the PDIA6 gene from A. cerana cerana (AccPDIA6). We investigated the expression patterns of AccPDIA6 in response to oxidative stress induced by H202, UV, HgC12, extreme temperatures (4 C, 42 C) and pesticides (thiamethoxam and hexythiazox) and found that AccPDIA6 was upregulated by these treatments. Western blot analysis indicated that AccPDIA6 was also upregulated by oxidative stress at the protein level. In addition, a survival test demonstrated that the survival rate of E. call cells expressing AccPDIA6 increased under oxidative stress, suggesting a possible antioxidant function of AccPDIA6. In addition, we tested the transcripts of other antioxidant genes and found that some of them were downregulated in AccPDIA6 knockdown samples. It was also discovered that the antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in AccPDIA6-silenced bees.

The paradox between the benefits that these animals represent to humans and the evidence of human activities driving their extinction calls for the urgent protection of bees. To address the role of chemical pollution in this scenario, we assessed the acute toxicity as well as four biomarker responses (cholinesterase [ChE], glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation [LPO]) elicited by dietary 24-h exposure to three insecticides (malathion, imidacloprid, and fipronil) on the stingless neotropical bee Tetragonisca angustula and the honeybee Apis mellifera. Malathion was the most toxic substance to both species, with 48-h median lethal doses (LD50s) of 0.25 ng/bee to A. mellifera and 0.02 ng/bee to T. angustula. Fipronil was also highly toxic and presented a similar toxicity to both species, with 48-h LD50s of 0.5 ng/bee (A. mellifera) and 0.4 ng/bee (T. angustula). Imidacloprid had the lowest acute toxicity with a 48-h LD50 of 29 ng/bee for A. mellifera, whereas T. angustula tolerated exposure higher than 35 ng/bee. Apparent biomarker responses were observed in bees of both species that survived exposure to higher concentrations of malathion (ChE inhibition) and fipronil (increased LPO). Our results suggest that specific sensitivity to insecticides varies greatly among compounds and pollinator species, but the use of different representative species can facilitate the prioritization of substances regarding their risk to pollinators.

Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./ŒºL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level.

After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively). The responses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaEs-1-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP. Thus, this set of honeybee biomarkers appears to be a promising tool to evaluate environmental and honeybee health, and it could generate fingerprints to characterize exposures to pesticides.

Kenyon cells build up the mushroom body neuropils, which are involved in higher order neuronal processes such as olfactory learning. We measured whole-cell currents through nicotinic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors using patch-clamp techniques. Pressure applications of imidacloprid elicited inward currents, which were irreversibly blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Imidacloprid was a partial nicotinic agonist, since it elicited only 36% of ACh-induced currents and competitively blocked 64% of the peak ACh-induced currents. GABA-induced currents were partially blocked when imidacloprid was coapplied and this block was independent upon activation of nAChRs.

We investigated the susceptibility of Tetragonisca fiebrigi to sublethal concentrations of insecticides fipronil, malathion, and thiamethoxam (administered through contact and ingestion) by determining the LC50 values after 24 hours of exposure and analyzing changes in the activity of esterase isoenzymes and the chromatin in brain cells. The LC50 values showed that all three insecticides were highly toxic through contact and ingestion. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the relative EST-4 (carboxylesterase) activity in T. fiebrigi was partially inhibited by malathion and fipronil ingestion. Moreover, the EST-4 band intensity was increased following high-concentration thiamethoxam (contact) exposure, indicating the increased relative activity of this isoenzyme to detoxify the compound. In the cytochemical analysis of brain cells, the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) points for the control stingless bees and malathion ingestion-exposed and thiamethoxam-exposed (contact and ingestion) stingless bees were in the range of 0.20-0.30 M MgCl2, whereas that for malathion contact-exposed bees was 0.15 M MgCl2, indicating chromatin relaxation and suggesting an increase in gene expression.

However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT‚ÄìPCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40¬∞C to 43¬∞C and 46¬∞C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown. Conclusion: AccTid plays a crucial role in A. cerana cerana stress responses and may mediate oxidative damage caused by various stresses. Our findings will offer fundamental knowledge for further investigations of the defence mechanism of A. cerana cerana against environmental stresses.

The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 degrees C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees.
