AB  - The regulatory process for assessing the risks of pesticides to bees relies heavily on the use of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, as a model for other bee species. However, the validity of using A. mellifera as a surrogate for other Apis and non-Apis bees in pesticide risk assessment has been questioned. Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear. Here we used a phylogenomic approach to identify > 100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families. Functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species revealed that P450-mediated detoxification of certain systemic insecticides, including the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the butenolide flupyradifurone, is conserved across all major bee pollinator families. However, our analyses also reveal that CYP9Q-related genes are not universal to all bee species, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes. Thus, our results reveal an evolutionary conserved capacity to metabolize certain insecticides across all major bee families while identifying a small number of bee species where this function may have been lost. Furthermore, they illustrate the potential of a toxicogenomic approach to inform pesticide risk assessment for nonmanaged bee species by predicting the capability of bee pollinator species to break down synthetic insecticides. copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

AB  - The honey bee, Apis mellifera, shows variation in sensitivity to imidacloprid and thiacloprid, which does not reside at the target site but rather in the rapidly oxidative metabolism mediated by P450s (such as a single P450, CYP9Q3). An in silico study was conducted to investigate the various metabolism of imidacloprid and thiacloprid. The binding potency of thiacloprid was stronger and a stable π-π interaction with Phe121 and the N–H⋯N hydrogen bond with Asn214 are found in the CYP9Q3-thiacloprid system but absent in imidacloprid, which might affect the potential metabolic activity. Moreover, the values of highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy and the vertical ionization potential (IP) of two compounds demonstrated that thiacloprid is more likely to oxidation. The findings revealed the probable binding modes of imidacloprid and thiacloprid with CYP9Q3 and might facilitate future design of the low bee toxicity neonicotinoid insecticides. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is growing number of studies demonstrating a close relationship between insect gut microbiota and insecticide resistance. However, the contribution of the honey bee gut microbiota to host detoxification ability has yet to be investigated. In order to address this question, we compared the expression of cytochrome P450s (P450s) genes between gut microbiota deficient (GD) workers and conventional gut community (CV) workers and compared the mortality rates and the pesticide residue levels of GD and CV workers treated with thiacloprid or tau-fluvalinate. Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees. Taken together, our results demonstrated that honey bee gut symbiont could contribute to bee health through the modification of the host xenobiotics detoxification pathways and revealed a potential negative impact of antibiotics to honey bee detoxification ability and health. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are markedly less sensitive to neonicotinoid insecticides containing a cyanoimino pharmacophore than to those with a nitroimino group. Although previous work has suggested that this results from enhanced metabolism of the former by detoxification enzymes, the specific enzyme(s) involved remain to be characterized. In this work, a pretreatment of honey bees with a sublethal dose of thiacloprid resulted in induced insensitivity to the same compound immediately following thiacloprid feeding. A longer pretreatment time resulted in no, or increased, sensitivity. Transcriptome profiling, using microarrays, identified a number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes that were over-expressed significantly in insecticide-treated bees compared with untreated controls. These included five P450s, CYP6BE1, CYP305D1, CYP6AS5, CYP315A1, CYP301A1, and a carboxyl/cholinesterase (CCE) CCE8. Four of these P450s were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli and their ability to metabolize thiacloprid examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. © 2016 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Stingless bees are ecologically and economically important species in the tropics and subtropics, but there has been little research on the characterization of detoxification systems and immune responses within them. This is critical for understanding their responses to, and defenses against, a variety of environmental stresses, including agrochemicals. Therefore, we studied the detoxification and immune responses of a stingless bee, Nanotrigona perilampoides, which is an important stingless bee that is widely distributed throughout Mexico, including urban areas, and has the potential to be used in commercial pollination. We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days. Our results demonstrate that N. perilampoides stingless bees are extremely sensitive to imidacloprid, even at low concentrations, and provide greater insight into how stingless bees respond to pesticide toxicity. This is the first study of its kind to look at detoxification systems and immune responses in Mexican stingless bees, an ecologically and economically important taxon. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Honey bees (Apis mellifera) are exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides, but little is known about insecticide effects on their survivorship associated to health-related gene expression. To test the effect of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on the lifespan and health of honey bees, workers were orally and topically exposed to LD5 doses of these insecticides. The survivorship of treated bees was monitored and the expression of three immune-related genes, hymenoptaecin (AmHym), basket (AmBask) and lysozyme (AmLyso2) was analyzed at 24 and 72 hours post treatment (hpt), as well as that of the antioxidant-related gene vitellogenin (AmVit2), the poly-U binding factor (AmPuf68), and the detoxification gene cytochrome P450 (AmCYP9Q3). The three insecticides significantly reduced the length of life of bees but the mode of application did not affect survivorship. AmHym, AmBask and AmVit2 expression was significantly down-regulated at 72 hpt in bees treated with clothianidin and imidacloprid, indicating immunosuppression. However, AmLyso2, AmCYP9Q3 and AmPuf68 were significantly up-regulated. The down-regulation of AmVit2 could have caused decreased resistance to oxidative stress. AmPuf68 expression could be associated with increased protection against xenobionts. AmCYP9Q3 was up-regulated at 24 and 72 hpt in oral exposures, but only until 72 hpt in topical exposures, indicating faster sensitivity towards detoxification mechanisms in oral treatments. This study demonstrated detrimental effects of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on honey bee survivorship, immunity and antioxidant mechanisms, and an induction of defense and detoxification responses that could be physiologically costly to the bees. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Recently, pesticides have been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the large-scale decline in honey bee populations, including colony collapse disorder. The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. © 2022 Kim et al.

AB  - The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on the health of bee pollinators is a topic of intensive research and considerable current debate [1]. As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2–5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health. N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid insecticides are much less toxic to honeybees and bumble bees than N-nitroguanidine compounds. Manjon et al. show that this results from differences in their efficiency of metabolism by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, demonstrating their role as key determinants of bee sensitivity to this insecticide class. © 2018 The Author(s)

AB  - The impact of pesticides on the health of bee pollinators is determined in part by the capacity of bee detoxification systems to convert these compounds to less toxic forms. For example, recent work has shown that cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this, exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration. Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. © 2019 Beadle et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

TI  - Pesticide risk assessment at the molecular level using honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes: A complementary approach
AU  - Haas, J.

T2  - Environment International
AB  - Honey bee (Apis mellifera) first-tier pesticide risk assessment is largely based on standardized laboratory toxicity bioassays after both acute and chronic exposure. Recent research on honey bee cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) uncovered CYP9Q3 as the molecular determinant mediating neonicotinoid insecticide selectivity and explaining why certain neonicotinoids such as thiacloprid show > 1000-fold lower acute toxicity than others (e.g. imidacloprid). Here this knowledge is leveraged for mechanistic risk assessment at the molecular level using a fluorescence-based high-throughput in vitro assay, predicting the interaction of diverse pesticidal chemotypes, including azole fungicides, with recombinantly expressed honey bee CYP9Q enzymes, known to metabolize thiacloprid, acetamiprid and tau-fluvalinate. Some azole fungicides were shown to be synergistic in combination with certain insecticides, including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, whereas others such as prothioconazole were not. We demonstrate that biochemical CYP9Q2/CYP9Q3 inhibition data of azoles revealed a striking correlation with their synergistic potential at the organismal level, and even allow to explain combined toxicity effects observed for tank mixtures under field conditions. Our novel toxicogenomics-based approach is designed to complement existing methods for pesticide risk assessment with unprecedented screening capacity, by utilizing honey bee P450 enzymes known to confer pesticide selectivity, in order to biochemically address issues of ecotoxicological concern. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - In this study, different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response were studied. Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field. © 2017 De Smet et al.

AB  - Flupyradifurone, a novel butenolide insecticide, selectively targets insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), comparable to structurally different insecticidal chemotypes such as neonicotinoids and sulfoximines. However, flupyradifurone was shown in acute toxicity tests to be several orders of magnitude less toxic to western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) than many other insecticides targeting insect nAChRs. The underlying reasons for this difference in toxicity remains unknown and were investigated here. Pharmacokinetic studies after contact application of [14C]flupyradifurone to honey bees revealed slow uptake, with internalized compound degraded into a few metabolites that are all practically non-toxic to honey bees in both oral and contact bioassays. Furthermore, receptor binding studies revealed a lack of high-affinity binding of these metabolites to honey bee nAChRs. Screening of a library of 27 heterologously expressed honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of flupyradifurone: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3. Transgenic Drosophila lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less susceptible to flupyradifurone when compared to control flies, confirming the importance of these P450s for flupyradifurone metabolism in honey bees. Biochemical assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BOMFC) indicated a weak, non-competitive inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by flupyradifurone. In contrast, the azole fungicides prochloraz and propiconazole were strong nanomolar inhibitors of these flupyradifurone metabolizing P450s, explaining their highly synergistic effects in combination with flupyradifurone as demonstrated in acute laboratory contact toxicity tests of adult bees. Interestingly, the azole fungicide prothioconazole is only slightly synergistic in combination with flupyradifurone – an observation supported by molecular P450 inhibition assays. Such molecular assays have value in the prediction of potential risks posed to bees by flupyradifurone mixture partners under applied conditions. Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of the identified P450 genes in all honey bee life-stages, with highest expression levels observed in late larvae and adults, suggesting honey bees have the capacity to metabolize flupyradifurone across all life-stages. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the low intrinsic toxicity of flupyradifurone to honey bees and offer a new, more holistic approach to support bee pollinator risk assessment by molecular means. © 2021 The Authors

T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel butenolide insecticide binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), has been shown to be less acutely toxic to western honey bees (Apis mellifera) than other insecticides such as neonicotinoids sharing the same target-site. A previous study revealed that this is due to enhanced oxidative metabolism of FPF, mediated by three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), including CYP6AQ1. Therefore, we followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in FPF metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis on four stingless bee species, including Frieseomelitta varia, Heterotrigona itama, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonula carbonaria to identify CYP6AQ1-like functional orthologs. Three non-Meliponini, but tropical bee species, i.e., Ammobates syriacus, Euglossa dilemma and Megalopta genalis were analyzed as well. We identified candidate P450s in all (neo)tropical species with greater than 61% and 67% predicted protein sequence identities when compared to A. mellifera CYP6AQ1 and Bombus terrestris CYP6AQ26, respectively. Heterologous expression in High Five insect cells of these functional orthologs revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a preference for the O-debenzylation of bulkier substrates. Competition assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BOMFC) with these enzymes indicated inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by increasing concentrations of FPF. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/ MS analysis revealed the capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolize FPF by hydroxylation in vitro at various levels, indicating a conserved FPF detoxification potential in different (neo)tropical bee species including Meliponini. This research, employing a toxicogenomics approach, provides important insights into the potential of stingless and other tropical bee species to detoxify FPF, and highlights the significance of investigating the detoxification mechanisms of insecticides in non-Apis bee species by molecular tools to inform risk assessment and conservation efforts.

AB  - Background: Honey bees are exposed to phytochemicals through the nectar, pollen and propolis consumed to sustain the colony. They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that regulation of honey bee P450s is tuned to chemicals occurring naturally in the hive environment and that, in terms of toxicological capacity, a diet of sugar is not equivalent to a diet of honey.

AB  - Simple Summary Honey bees play an invaluable role in ecosystem stability and global food security. Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially "bee-safe" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees.

AB  - Neonicotinoids as thiamethoxam and thiacloprid are suspected to be implicated in the decline of honey bee populations. As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling in insects, leading to neurotoxicity and are therefore globally used as insecticides. Several behavioral studies have shown links between neonicotinoid exposure of bees and adverse effects on foraging activity, homing flight performance and reproduction, but the molecular aspects underlying these effects are not well-understood. In the last years, several studies through us and others showed the effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on gene expression in the brain of honey bees. Transcripts of acetylcholine receptors, hormonal regulation, stress markers, detoxification enzymes, immune system related genes and transcripts of the energy metabolism were altered after neonicotinoid exposure. To elucidate the link between homing flight performance and shifts in gene expression in the brain of honey bees after neonicotinoid exposure, we combined homing flight activity experiments applying RFID technology and gene expression analysis. We analyzed the expression of endocrine factors, stress genes, detoxification enzymes and genes linked to energy metabolism in forager bees after homing flight experiments. Three different experiments (experiment I: pilot study; experiment II: “worst-case” study and experiment III: laboratory study) were performed. In a pilot study, we wanted to investigate if we could see differences in gene expression between controls and exposed bees (experiment I). This first study was followed by a so-called “worst-case” study (experiment II), where we investigated mainly differences in the expression of transcripts linked to energy metabolism between fast and slow returning foragers. We found a correlation between homing flight duration and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, one transcript linked to oxidative phosphorylation. In the third experiment (experiment III), foragers were exposed in the laboratory to 1 ng/bee thiamethoxam and 8 ng/bee thiacloprid followed by gene expression analysis without a subsequent flight experiment. We could partially confirm the induction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, which we detected in experiment II. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the feeding mode (group feeding vs. single bee feeding) on data scattering and demonstrated that single bee feeding is superior to group feeding as it significantly reduces variability in gene expression. Based on the data, we thus hypothesize that the disruption of energy metabolism may be one reason for a prolongation of homing flight duration in neonicotinoid treated bees.

AB  - Understanding the cause of honey bee (Apis mellifera) population decline has attracted immense attention worldwide in recent years. Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the most probable factors due to the physiological and behavioral damage they cause to honey bees. However, the influence of thiacloprid, a relatively less toxic cyanogen-substituted form of neonicotinoid, on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) development is not well studied. The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that chronic sublethal thiacloprid can affect honey bee colonies by reducing survival and delaying bee development. Copyright © 2022 Li, Ke, Li, Diao, Wang and Liu.

AB  - Thiacloprid is widely used in agriculture and may affect pollinators. However, its molecular effects are poorly known. Here, we report the global gene expression profile in the brain of honey bee foragers assessed by RNA-sequencing. Bees were exposed for 72 h to nominal concentrations of 25 and 250 ng/bee via sucrose solution. Determined residue concentrations by LC-MS/MS were 0.59 and 5.49 ng/bee, respectively. Thiacloprid exposure led to 5 and 71 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as metabolism enzymes and transporters were altered at 5.49 ng/bee. Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that mitochondrial ribosome proteins, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and additional metabolic pathways were altered. Among 21 genes assessed by RT-qPCR, the transcript of farnesol dehydrogenase involved in juvenile hormone III synthesis was significantly down-regulated. Transcripts of cyp6a14-like and apolipophorin-II like protein, cytochrome oxidase (cox17) and the non-coding RNA (LOC102654625) were significantly up-regulated at 5.49 ng/bee. Our findings indicate that thiacloprid causes transcriptional changes of genes prominently associated with mitochondria, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. This highlight potential effects of this neonicotinoid on energy metabolism, which may compromise bee foraging and thriving populations at environmentally relevant concentrations. Thiacloprid alters nuclear genes in brain encoding mitochondrial proteins. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Declines in honey bee populations represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/μl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of honey bees, but the molecular basis underlying adverse effects is poorly known. Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3′(2′), 5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq. Our study highlights the comparative molecular effects of neonicotinoid exposure to bees. Further studies should link these effects with physiological outcomes for a better understanding of effects of neonicotinoids. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Neonicotinoid pesticides negatively impact bumble bee health, even at sublethal concentrations. Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0 ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects. We found 678 genes differentially expressed under both imidacloprid exposures relative to controls, including mitochondrial activity, development, and DNA replication genes. However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure; uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results. A smaller differentially expressed set only in lower concentration larvae, included neural development and cell growth genes. Our findings show varying molecular consequences under different field-realistic neonicotinoid concentrations, and that even low concentrations may affect fundamental biological processes. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is the most important Chinese indigenous species, while its toxicological characteristic against neonicotinoids is poorly known. Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up-and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Asian honey bee in response to neonicotinoids sublethal toxicity, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Thiamethoxam, an insecticide with high usage and large amounts of environmental residues, has been reported to affect the pupation and survival of honey bee larvae at sublethal concentrations. The molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we measured the response of juvenile hormone (JH) to environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), monitored the dynamic changes in the transcription of genes encoding major JH metabolic enzymes (CYP15A1, FAMET, JHAMT and JHE) using RT-qPCR, and analysed the transcriptome changes in worker larvae under thiamethoxam stress using RNA-seq. Thiamethoxam significantly increased the levels of JH3 in honey bee larvae, but no significant changes in the transcript levels of the four major metabolic enzymes were observed. Thiamethoxam exposure resulted in 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). P450 CYP6AS5 was upregulated, and some ion-related, odourant-related and gustatory receptors for sugar taste genes were altered significantly. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption were influenced by thiamethoxam. These changes may do harm to honey bee caste differentiation, foraging behaviour related to sensory perception and nutrient levels of bee colonies. These results represent the first assessment of the effects of thiamethoxam on JH in honey bee larvae and provides a new perspective and molecular basis for the study of JH regulation and thiamethoxam toxicity to honey bees. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Neonicotinoid insecticides are now the most widely used insecticides in the world. Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging, and immunocompetence in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Despite these, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and drug metabolism. Overall, our results provide a basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the complex interactions between neonicotinoid insecticides and honey bees. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - The survival of a species depends on its capacity to adjust to changing environmental conditions, and new stressors. Such new, anthropogenic stressors include the neonicotinoid class of crop-protecting agents, which have been implicated in the population declines of pollinating insects, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 mu g/L-1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program. The multifaceted, physiological response described here may be of importance to our general understanding of pollinator health. Muscles, for instance, work at high glycolytic rates and flight performance could be impacted should low levels of this evolutionarily novel stressor likewise induce downregulation of energy metabolising genes in adult pollinators.

AB  - Imidacloprid and other neonicotinoid insecticides severely impact the performance and survival of honey bees and other pollinators. In the present study, we focused on the gene expression profile of newly emerged Apis mellifera queen bees after sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage. Royal jelly containing 1 ppb imidacloprid was provided to larvae for 3 consecutive days (2–4 days postemergence). Queen larvae treated with imidacloprid showed lower capping and emergence rates (35.5% and 24.22%, respectively) than did control larvae (61.68% and 52.95%, respectively), indicating a high failure rate of queen rearing associated with imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage. The molecular response to imidacloprid treatment was examined next. By comparing the gene expression profiles of imidacloprid-treated queen larvae and those of control queen larvae using DESeq2, we identified 215 differentially expressed genes, with 105 and 111 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. Gene Ontology results indicated that chitin binding– and calcium ion binding–related genes were upregulated, while phototransduction- and visual perception–related genes were downregulated. The high mortality rate and altered gene expression profiles suggest that treatment with even 1 ppb imidacloprid can severely impact queen bee survival.

AB  - While many studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor on honey bees (Apis mellifera), more information on the combined effects of such stressors on gene expression, including neural related genes, and their impact on biological pathways is needed. This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors. The reduced numbers of DEGs and KEGG pathways associated with the DEGs for the combined stressors compared to the stressors alone indicates that the interaction of the stressors is not additive or synergistic, but antagonistic. The possible implications of the antagonistic effect on the number of DEGs are discussed. © 2020 Morfin et al.

AB  - Social bees are important insect pollinators of wildflowers and agricultural crops, making their reported declines a global concern. A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens. Our work demonstrates how RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling can provide detailed novel insight on the mechanisms mediating pesticide toxicity to a key insect pollinator.

AB  - Honey bee larvae exposed to sublethal doses of imidacloprid show behavioural abnormalities as adult insects. Previous studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon originates from abnormal neural development in response to imidacloprid exposure. Here, we further investigated the global gene expression changes in the heads of newly emerged adults and observed that 578 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in gene expression after imidacloprid exposure. This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated. These downregulation patterns were further confirmed through analyses using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the heads of 6-day-old nurse bees. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that sublethal doses of imidacloprid affect mrjp expression and likely weaken bee colonies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Imidacloprid is a global health threat that severely poisons the economically and ecologically important honeybee pollinator, Apis mellifera. However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy. These findings have broader implications for studies assessing pesticide hazards in other juvenile animals. © Li, Wang et al.

AB  - Bees are important pollinators for ecosystems and agriculture; however, populations have suffered a decline that may be associated with several factors, including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to diseases and parasites and use of pesticides. The extensive use of neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid, as agricultural pesticides, leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in bees, pollen, nectar, and honey, thereby inducing deleterious effects. Forager honey bees face significant exposure to pesticide residues while searching for resources outside the hive, particularly systemic pesticides like imidacloprid. In this study, 360 Apis mellifera bees, twenty-one days old (supposed to be in the forager phase) previously marked were fed syrup (honey and water, 1:1 m/v) containing a lethal dose (0.081 μg/bee) or sublethal dose (0.00081 μg/bee) of imidacloprid. The syrup was provided in plastic troughs, with 250 μL added per trough onto each plastic Petri dish containing 5 bees (50 μL per bee). The bees were kept in the plastic Petri dishes inside an incubator, and after 1 and 4 h of ingestion, the bees were euthanised and stored in an ultra-freezer (−80 °C) for transcriptome analysis. Following the 1-h ingestion of imidacloprid, 1516 genes (73 from lethal dose; 1509 from sublethal dose) showed differential expression compared to the control, while after 4 h, 758 genes (733 from lethal dose; 25 from sublethal) exhibited differential expression compared to the control. All differentially expressed genes found in the brain tissue transcripts of forager bees were categorised based on gene ontology into functional groups encompassing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. These analyses revealed that sublethal doses might be capable of altering more genes than lethal doses, potentially associated with a phenomenon known as insecticide-induced hormesis. Alterations in genes related to areas such as the immune system, nutritional metabolism, detoxification system, circadian rhythm, odour detection, foraging activity, and memory in bees were present after exposure to the pesticide. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of both lethal and sublethal doses of imidacloprid, thereby providing valuable insights for establishing public policies regarding the use of neonicotinoids, which are directly implicated in the compromised health of Apis mellifera bees. © 2024

AB  - Neonicotinoid insecticides are potent agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are a major factor in the decline of pollinators worldwide. Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36°C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20°C). At 20°C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36°C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced. This study contributes to the understanding of how neonicotinoid residual doses may alter honey bee physiology. © 2020

AB  - The impact of widespread pesticide use in agriculture has been a major concern to the beekeeping industry. Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have a negative impact on honey bees. Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages. All tested honey bees exposed to Varroa had significantly elevated DWV loads. Overall, our data showed changes in immune-related gene expression of three honey bee development stages, exposed to each of two stressors alone or combined, which varies depending on the developmental stage. © 2019, © 2019 International Bee Research Association.

AB  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are constantly exposed to a wide variety of environmental stressors such as parasites and pesticides. Among them, Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides might act in combination and lead to a higher honeybee mortality. We investigated the molecular response of honeybees exposed to N. ceranae, to insecticides (fipronil or imidacloprid), and to a combination of both stressors. Midgut transcriptional changes induced by these stressors were measured in two independent experiments combining a global RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach with the screening of the expression of selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Although N. ceranae-insecticide combinations induced a significant increase in honeybee mortality, we observed that they did not lead to a synergistic effect. According to gene expression profiles, chronic exposure to insecticides had no significant impact on detoxifying genes but repressed the expression of immunity-related genes. Honeybees treated with N. ceranae , alone or in combination with an insecticide, showed a strong alteration of midgut immunity together with modifications affecting cuticle coatings and trehalose metabolism. An increasing impact of treatments on gene expression profiles with time was identified suggesting an absence of stress recovery which could be linked to the higher mortality rates observed. © 2014 Aufauvre et al.

AB  - Honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae reared in vitro were exposed to one of nine pesticides and/or were challenged with the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Total RNA was extracted from individual larvae and first strand cDNAs were generated. Gene-expression changes in larvae were measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting transcripts for pathogens and genes involved in physiological processes, bee health, immunity, and/or xenobiotic detoxification. Transcript levels for Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein (PGRPSC), a pathogen recognition gene, increased in larvae exposed to Varroa mites (P<0.001) and were not changed in pesticide treated larvae. As expected, Varroa-parasitized brood had higher transcripts of Deformed Wing Virus than did control larvae (P<0.001). Varroa parasitism, arguably coupled with virus infection, resulted in significantly higher transcript abundances for the antimicrobial peptides abaecin, hymenoptaecin, and defensin1. Transcript levels for Prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPOact), an immune end product, were elevated in larvae treated with myclobutanil and chlorothalonil (both are fungicides) (P<0.001). Transcript levels for Hexameric storage protein (Hsp70) were significantly upregulated in imidacloprid, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, and amitraz treated larvae. Definitive impacts of pesticides and Varroa parasitism on honey bee larval gene expression were demonstrated. Interactions between larval treatments and gene expression for the targeted genes are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During their lifetime honey bees (Apis mellifera) rarely experience optimal conditions. Sometimes, a simultaneous action of multiple stressors, natural and chemical, results in even greater effect than of any stressor alone. Therefore, integrative investigations of different factors affecting honey bees have to be carried out. In this study, adult honey bees exposed to thiamethoxam in larval and/or adult stage and infected with Nosema ceranae were examined. Newly emerged bees from colonies, non-treated or treated with thiamethoxam, were organized in six groups and kept in cages. Thiamethoxam treated bees were further exposed to either thiamethoxam or Nosema (groups TT and TN), or simultaneously to both (group TTN). Newly emerged bees from non-treated colonies were exposed to Nosema (group CN). From both, treated and non-treated colonies two groups were organized and further fed only with sugar solution (groups C and TC). Here, we present the expression profile of 19 genes in adult worker honey bees comprising those involved in immune, detoxification, development and apoptosis response. Results showed that gene expression patterns changed with time and depended on the treatment. In group TC at the time of emergence the majority of tested genes were downregulated, among which nine were significantly altered. The same gene pattern was observed on day six, where the only significantly upregulated gene was defensin-1. On day nine most of analyzed genes in all experimental groups showed upregulation compared to control group, where upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes abaecin, defensin-1 and defensin-2 was significant in groups TT and TTN. On day 15 we observed a similar pattern of expression in groups TC and TT exposed to thiamethoxam only, where most of the detoxification genes were downregulated. Additionally RNA loads of Nosema and honey bee viruses were recorded. We detected a synergistic interaction of thiamethoxam and Nosema, reflected in lowest honey bee survival. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Both Nosema ceranae and insecticides are adversely affecting honey bees. How both factors affect gene expression and honey bee survival are well studied. However, only a few studies dealt with the interactions of the two factors. Here we studied the effects of both, when alone and in combination, on honey bee survival and expression changes of immune and detoxification genes. Newly emerged bees were randomly assigned four different treatments: control bees, bees exposed to thiamethoxam, bees exposed to thiamethoxam and then infected with Nosema, and bees infected with N.ceranae only. When combined with Nosema, thiamethoxam caused a significant reduction in survival from the control, but this reduction is not significantly different from N. ceranae alone. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused significantly increased expressions compared to the control for the genes of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptacin, but significantly decreased expression for the defensin gene. When the two factors were combined, the expression patterns were similar to N.ceranae infection alone (apidaecin, defencin and hymenoptaecin), except abaecin, which was increased compared to Nosema infected bees. For detoxification genesCCE8 and CYP315A1, thiamethoxam caused significantly increased gene expression but Nosema caused significantly decreased expression. When combined, the two factors did not show a further increase in Mortality compared to Nosema infection alone. Our study shows a clear combined effect of thiamethoxam and Nosema, but mainly in worker mortality and very little effect on gene expression. This study highlights the importance of observing mortality when studying the effect of insecticide on gene expression. © 2021 International Bee Research Association.

AB  - Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Health of honey bees is threatened by a variety of stressors, including pesticides and parasites. Here, we investigated effects of acetamiprid, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae, which act either alone or in combination. Our results suggested that interaction between the three factors was additive, with survival risk increasing as the number of stressors increased. Although exposure to 150 μg/L acetamiprid alone did not negatively impact honey bee survival, it caused severe damage to midgut tissue. Among the three stressors, V. destructor posed the greatest threat to honey bee survival, and N. ceranae exacerbated intestinal damage and increased thickness of the midgut wall. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that different combinations of stressors elicited specific gene expression responses in honey bees, and genes involved in energy metabolism, immunity, and detoxification were altered in response to multiple stressor combinations. Additionally, genes associated with Toll and Imd signalling, tyrosine metabolism, and phototransduction pathway were significantly suppressed in response to different combinations of multiple stressors. This study enhances our understanding of the adaptation mechanisms to multiple stressors and aids in development of suitable protective measures for honey bees. Environmental Implication: We believe our study is environmentally relevant for the following reasons: This study investigates combined effects of pesticide, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae. These stressors are known to pose a threat to long-term survival of honey bees (Apis mellifera) and stability of the ecosystems. The research provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of honey bees in response to multiple stressors and developing effective conservation strategies. Further research can identify traits that promote honey bee survival in the face of future challenges from multiple stressors to maintain the overall stability of environment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The decreasing number of bees is a global ecological problem. With the advancement of agricultural modernisation, the large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides is one of the main factors leading to the decline of bees. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. Acute (48 h) oral toxicity tests showed that a 5% lethal concentration (LC5 ) was 0.220 mg/L, and a 20% lethal concentration (LC20 ) was 0.458 mg/L. The gene expression profile shows that when compared with the control group, the LC5 group induced 206 significantly upregulated, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 363 significantly downregulated DEGs, while the LC20 group induced 180 significantly upregulated DEGs and 419 significantly downregulated DEGs. Significantly, transcriptomic analysis revealed DEGs involved in immunity, detoxification, and the nervous system, such as antimicrobial peptides, vitellogenin, synaptotagmin-10, AChE-2, and nAChRa9. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Collectively, our findings will help clarify the deleterious physiological and behavioural impacts of dinotefuran on bees and provide a basis for future research on the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) are exposed to many parasites, but little is known about interactions with abiotic stressors on their health, particularly when affected as larvae. Larvae were exposed singly and in combination to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and three sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin to evaluate their effects on survivorship, weight, haemocyte counts, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression of the adult bees that subsequently developed. Clothianidin significantly reduced bee weight at the highest dose and was associated with an increase in haemocyte counts at the lowest dose, whereas V. destructor parasitism increased DWV levels, reduced bee emergence, lowered weight and reduced haemocyte counts. An interaction between the two stressors was observed for weight at emergence. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), V. destructor infestation resulted in broader down-regulatory effects related to immunity that was often shared with the combined stressors, while clothianidin resulted in a broader up-regulatory effect more related to central metabolic pathways that was often shared with the combined stressors. Parasites and abiotic stressors can have complex interactions, including additive effects on reduced weight, number of up-regulated DEGs and biological pathways associated with metabolism. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to assess the effects of landscape and pesticides on honey bee survival and physiological stress. Integrated use of acetylcholinesterase and detoxification enzymes was tested on honey bee brains for detecting possible exposure to pesticides. Foragers were tracked in agricultural and non-agricultural landscapes in West Tennessee (USA) and then recovered for molecular and chemical analyses. In addition, four honey bee cohorts were fed imidacloprid in the laboratory ad libitum for several weeks and were analyzed by RT-qPCR for gene expression. Pesticides were identified at different concentrations in both crop flowers and recovered foragers. No significant differences in foragers’ mortality were found among locations. Acetylcholinesterase and detoxification genes showed no response to exposure to pesticides except for GstS3 and GstS4. Our results suggest that none of the studied genes make suitable biomarkers for honey bee exposed to pesticides. © 2017, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - Honey bees health is compromised by many factors such as the use of agrochemicals in agriculture and the various diseases that can affect them. Multiple studies have shown that these factors can interact, producing a synergistic effect that can compromise the viability of honey bees. This study analyses the interactions between different pesticides and the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and their effect on immune and detoxification gene expression, sugar consumption and mortality in the Iberian western honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). For this purpose, workers were infected with N. ceranae and subjected to a sugar-water diet with field concentrations of the pesticides sulfoxaflor, azoxystrobin and glyphosate. Increased sugar intake and altered immune and cytochrome P450 gene expression were observed in workers exposed to sulfoxaflor and infected with N. ceranae. None of the pesticides affected Nosema spore production in honey bee gut. Of the three pesticides tested (alone or in combination) only sulfoxaflor increased mortality in honey bees. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of sulfoxaflor were attenuated in contact with other pesticides, and that Nosema infection leads to increase sugar intake in sulfoxaflor-exposed bees. Overall, this underlines the importance of studying the interaction between different stressors to understand their overall impact not only on honey bee but also on wild bees health. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Understanding the cumulative risk of chemical mixtures at environmentally realistic concentrations is a key challenge in honey bee ecotoxicology. Ecotoxicogenomics, including transcriptomics, measures responses in individual organisms at the molecular level which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying phenotypic responses induced by one or more stressors and link impacts on individuals to populations. Here, fifth instar honey bee larvae were sampled from a previously reported field experiment exploring the phenotypic impacts of environmentally realistic chronic exposures of the pesticide imidacloprid (5 mu g.kg(-1) for six weeks) and the acaricide thymol (250 g.kg(-1) applied via Apiguard gel in-hive for four weeks), both separately and in combination. RNA-seq was used to discover individual and interactive chemical effects on larval gene expression and to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to reported adult and colony phenotypes. The separate and combined treatments had distinct gene expression profiles which represented differentially affected signaling and metabolic pathways. The molecular signature of the mixture was characterised by additive interactions in canonical stress responses associated with oxidative stress and detoxification, and non-additive interactions in secondary responses including developmental, neurological, and immune pathways. Novel emergent impacts on eye development genes correlated with long-term defects in visual learning performance as adults. This is consistent with these chemicals working through independent modes of action that combine to impact common downstream pathways, and highlights the importance of establishing mechanistic links between molecular and phenotypic responses when predicting effects of chemical mixtures on ecologically relevant population outcomes.

AB  - Colony collapse disorder (CCD) has occurred in the United States since 2006 and has been reported in many countries with varying levels of severity. Although the cause of CCD is multifactorial, pesticide is a major factor that leads to colony collapse. At sublethal doses, pesticide is known to negatively affect honeybee physiological development and behaviour. Previously, we found the insecticides imidacloprid and deltamethrin significantly reduced honeybee dancing and foraging efficiency. In our experiments, the duration of honeybee imbibing food at the feeder declined and the returning period from the feeder to the hive increased in both insecticide groups compared with the control group. As a follow-up, we performed a deep RNA-seq analysis to reveal the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this altered foraging performance. Genes involved in detoxification were upregulated in both the imidacloprid and the deltamethrin-treatment groups. Gene members in immune pathways, odorant receptors and major royal jelly protein families were significantly downregulated in the treatment groups compared with the controls. This fluctuating gene expression profile shows that multifaceted aspects of honeybee physiology were affected by the two insecticides, which may lead to inaccurate communication and impaired learning and memory. Our findings reveal candidate molecular mechanisms leading to impaired dance performance in honeybees exposed to insecticides.

T2  - Environmental Science and Technology
AB  - Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

AB  - Acute toxicities (LD50s) of imidacloprid and clothianidin to Apis mellifera and A. cerana were investigated. Changing patterns of immune-related gene expressions and the activities of four enzymes between the two bee species were compared and analyzed after exposure to sublethal doses of insecticides. Results indicated that A. cerana was more sensitive to imidacloprid and clothianidin than A. mellifera. The acute oral LD50 values of imidacloprid and clothianidin for A. mellifera were 8.6 and 2.0 ng/bee, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for A. cerana were 2.7 and 0.5 ng/bee. The two bee species possessed distinct abilities to mount innate immune response against neonicotinoids. After 48 h of imidacloprid treatment, carboxylesterase (CCE), prophenol oxidase (PPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were significantly downregulated in A. mellifera but were upregulated in A. cerana. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly elevated in A. mellifera at 48 h after exposure to imidacloprid, but no significant change was observed in A. cerana. AChE was downregulated in both bee species at three different time points during clothianidin exposure, and GST activities were upregulated in both species exposed to clothianidin. Different patterns of immune-related gene expression and enzymatic activities implied distinct detoxification and immune responses of A. cerana and A. mellifera to imidacloprid and clothianidin. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pesticide pollution is one of the most important factors for global bee declines. Despite many studies have revealed that the most important Chinese indigenous species，Apis cerana, is presenting a high risk on exposure to neonicotinoids, the toxicology information on Apis cerana remain limited. This study was aimed to determine the acute and chronic toxic effects of thiacloprid (IUPAC name: {(2Z)-3-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene}cyanamide) on behavioral and physiological performance as well as genome-wide transcriptome in A. cerana. We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana. Altogether, our study deepens the understanding of the toxicological characteristic of A. cerana against thiacloprid, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress. © 2023

AU  - Mobley, MW
AU  - Gegear, RJ
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in the rapid global decline of bumblebees over recent years, particularly in agricultural and urban areas. While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.

AB  - A primary goal in biology is to understand the effects of multiple, interacting environmental stressors on organisms. Wild and domesticated bees are exposed to a wide variety of interacting biotic and abiotic stressors, with widespread declines in floral resources and agrochemical exposure being two of the most important. In this study, we used examinations of brain gene expression to explore the sublethal consequences of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and pollen diet composition in nest-founding bumble bee queens. We demonstrate for the first time that pollen diet composition can influence the strength of bumble bee queen responses to pesticide exposure at the molecular level. Specifically, one pollen mixture in our study appeared to buffer bumble bee queens entirely against the effects of pesticide exposure, with respect to brain gene expression. Additionally, we detected unique effects of pollen diet and sustained (versus more temporary) pesticide exposure on queen gene expression. Our findings support the hypothesis that nutritional status can help buffer animals against the harmful effects of other stressors, including pesticides, and highlight the importance of using molecular approaches to explore sublethal consequences of stressors.

AB  - In most cases, honey bees experience pesticide pollution in a long-term period through direct or indirect exposure, such as the development process from larvae to the pre-harvest stage. At present, little is known about how honey bees respond to pesticide stresses during the continuous development period. This study aims to examine effects of long-term acetamiprid exposure on the development and survival of honey bees, and further present the expression profile in larvae, 1-day-old, and 7-day-old adult worker bees that related to immune, detoxification, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and memory. Honey bees from 2-day-old larvae to 14-day-old adults except the pupal stage were continuously fed with different acetamiprid solutions (0, 5, and 25 mg/L). We found that acetamiprid over 5 mg/L disturbed the development involving birth weight and emergence rate of newly emerged bees, and reduced the proportion of capped cells of larvae at 25 mg/L; gene expression related to immune and detoxification of worker bees exposed to acetamiprid was roughly activated, returned and then inhibited from larval to emerged and to the late adult stage, respectively. Moreover, lifespans of bees treated with acetamiprid at 25 mg/L were significantly reduced. The present study reflects the potential risk for honey bees continuously exposed to acetamiprid in the development stage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AU  - Yao, J.

T2  - Journal of Economic Entomology
AB  - The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has sparked concern over the toxicity risk to honey bees (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + λ -cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%. The LC 50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient, which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee (LD 50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 μl per bee per day. In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC 50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville (MS, United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations, clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2018.

AB  - Honey bees have significant ecological and economic value as important pollinators, but they are continuously exposed to various environmental stressors, including insecticides, which can impair their health and cause colony decline. (1) Background: Cognitive abilities are vital for the functional maintenance of honey bees; however, it remains unknown if chronic, low-dose exposure to thiacloprid during the larval stage impairs the cognitive abilities of emerged adult honey bees. (2) Methods: To explore this question, honey bee larvae were fed 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L thiacloprid during their developmental phase. Then, the cognitive (i.e., olfactory learning and memory) abilities of adult honey bees were quantified to assess the delayed impacts of early-stage thiacloprid exposure on adult honey bee cognition. Neural apoptosis and transcriptomic level were also evaluated to explore the neurological mechanisms underlying these effects. (3) Results: Our results revealed that chronic larval exposure to sublethal thiacloprid impaired the learning and memory abilities of adult honey bees by inducing neuronal apoptosis and transcriptomic alterations. (4) Conclusions: We highlighted a previously unknown impairment caused by thiacloprid in honey bees. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Pesticide exposure is regarded as a contributing factor to the high gross loss rates of managed colonies of Apis mellifera. Pesticides enter the hive through contaminated nectar and pollen carried by returning forager honey bees or placed in the hive by beekeepers when managing hive pests. We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss. Additionally, pesticide exposure altered gene expression of detoxification enzymes. However, the tested exposure scenario is unlikely to be representative of real-world conditions but emphasizes the importance of proper hive management to minimize pesticide contamination of the hive environment or simulates a future scenario of increased contamination. © 2019; The chronic larval exposure to different pesticides affect the survival and health of immature and potentially newly emerged adult honey bees. © 2019

AB  - Neonicotinoids are among the most widely used insecticides in the world and are recognized as a potential cause of pollinator decline. Previous studies have demonstrated that the neonicotinoid thiacloprid has adverse effects on foraging and memory behaviors. However, there is no direct evidence linking thiacloprid-induced neuronal cell damage in the brains of honeybees to learning and memory dysfunction. Adult honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers were chronically exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid. We discovered that thiacloprid negatively affected their survival, food consumption, and body weight. In addition, sucrose sensitivity and memory performance were impaired. We evaluated the apoptosis of honeybee brain cells using TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) and Caspase-3 assays, which revealed that thiacloprid increases the dose-dependent apoptosis of neurons in the mushroom bodies (MB) and antennal lobes (AL). We also determined the abnormal transcripts of multiple genes, including vitellogenin (Vg), immune system genes (apidaecin and catalase), and memory-associated genes (pka, creb, Nmdar1, Dop2, Oa1, Oa-2R, and Oa-3R). These results indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid cause abnormal expression of memory-related genes and apoptosis of brain cells in the AL and MB, which may contribute to the memory disorder induced by thiacloprid exposure. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The environmental residue/sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides are believed to generate a negative impact on pollinators, including honey bees. Here we report our recent investigation on how imidacloprid, one of the major neonicotinoids, affects worker bees by profiling the transcriptomes of various ages of bees exposed to different doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage. The results show that imidacloprid treatments during the larval stage severely altered the gene expression profiles and may induce precocious foraging. Differential expression of foraging regulators was found in 14-day-old treated adults. A high transcriptome similarity between larvae-treated 14-day-old adults and 20-day-old controls was also observed, and the similarity was positively correlated with the dose of imidacloprid. One parts per billion (ppb) of imidacloprid was sufficient to generate a long-term impact on the bee’s gene expression as severe as with 50 ppb imidacloprid. The disappearance of nurse bees may be driven not only by the hive member constitution but also by the neonicotinoid-induced precocious foraging behavior. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Tzeng, Ting, Hsu, Wu, Zhong and Yang.

AB  - Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees. Melatonin secretion may be a defense mechanism to mitigate imidacloprid toxicity. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The honey bee, a crucial organism that provides ecological and economic value to humans, is currently facing threats from various environmental factors including pesticides. Numerous studies have been conducted to demonstrate the risks associated with neonicotinoid pesticides, but research on their occurrence in actual field conditions has not been identified. Therefore, in this study, we observed changes in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies located near rice cultivation areas as they progressed beyond the rice pesticide application period. Furthermore, we collected honey bees exposed to the clothianidin and analyzed their stress-related gene expression. The results showed that the foraging behavior of honey bee colonies located near rice cultivation areas did not exhibit significant differences between the treatment sites (Cheongyang and Gimje) and the control site (Wanju) during the experimental period. However, it was observed that the expression levels of stress-related genes in honey bees collected from the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control. Most of the stress-related genes were associated with detoxification processes in response to pesticides. As a result, pesticide treatment in proximity to rice cultivation areas did not cause direct damage to honey bees but had an indirect impact, suggesting the potential for ongoing chronic damage. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Uncontrolled use of pesticides has caused a dramatic reduction in the number of pollinators, including bees. Studies on the effects of pesticides on bees have reported effects on both metabolic and neurological levels under chronic exposure. In this study, variations in the differential expression of head and thorax–abdomen proteins in Africanized A. mellifera bees treated acutely with sublethal doses of glyphosate and imidacloprid were studied using a proteomic approach. A total of 92 proteins were detected, 49 of which were differentially expressed compared to those in the control group (47 downregulated and 2 upregulated). Protein interaction networks with differential protein expression ratios suggested that acute exposure of A. mellifera to sublethal doses of glyphosate could cause head damage, which is mainly associated with behavior and metabolism. Simultaneously, imidacloprid can cause damage associated with metabolism as well as, neuronal damage, cellular stress, and impairment of the detoxification system. Regarding the thorax–abdomen fractions, glyphosate could lead to cytoskeleton reorganization and a reduction in defense mechanisms, whereas imidacloprid could affect the coordination and impairment of the oxidative stress response. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Bumblebees are constantly exposed to a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses which they must defend themselves against to survive. Pathogens and pesticides represent important stressors that influence bumblebee health, both when acting alone or in combination. To better understand bumblebee health, we need to investigate how these factors interact, yet experimental studies to date generally focus on only one or two stressors. The aim of this study is to evaluate how combined effects of four important stressors (the gut parasite Nosema ceranae, the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin and the EBI fungicide tebuconazole) interact to affect bumblebees at the individual and colony levels. We established seven treatment groups of colonies that we pulse exposed to different combinations of these stressors for 2 weeks under laboratory conditions. Colonies were subsequently placed in the field for 7 weeks to evaluate the effect of treatments on the prevalence of N. ceranae in inoculated bumblebees, expression levels of immunity and detoxification-related genes, food collection, weight gain, worker and male numbers, and production of worker brood and reproductives. Exposure to pesticide mixtures reduced food collection by bumblebees. All immunity-related genes were upregulated in the bumblebees inoculated with N. ceranae when they had not been exposed to pesticide mixtures, and bumblebees exposed to the fungicide and the pyrethroid were less likely to have N. ceranae. Combined exposure to the three-pesticide mixture and N. ceranae reduced bumblebee colony growth, and all treatments had detrimental effects on brood production. The groups exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticide produced 40%–76% fewer queens than control colonies. Our findings show that exposure to combinations of stressors that bumblebees frequently come into contact with have detrimental effects on colony health and performance and could therefore have an impact at the population level. These results also have significant implications for current practices and policies for pesticide risk assessment and use as the combinations tested here are frequently applied simultaneously in the field. Understanding the interactions between different stressors will be crucial for improving our ability to manage bee populations and for ensuring pollination services into the future. © 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Multiple pesticides originating from plant protection treatments and the treatment of pests infecting honey bees are frequently detected in beehive matrices. Therefore, winter honey bees, which have a long life span, could be exposed to these pesticides for longer periods than summer honey bees. In this study, winter honey bees were exposed through food to the insecticide imidacloprid, the fungicide difenoconazole and the herbicide glyphosate, alone or in binary and ternary mixtures, at environmental concentrations (0 (controls), 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/L) for 20 days. The survival of the honey bees was significantly reduced after exposure to these 3 pesticides individually and in combination. Overall, the combinations had a higher impact than the pesticides alone with a maximum mortality of 52.9% after 20 days of exposure to the insecticide-fungicide binary mixture at 1 μg/L. The analyses of the surviving bees showed that these different pesticide combinations had a systemic global impact on the physiological state of the honey bees, as revealed by the modulation of head, midgut and abdomen glutathione-S-transferase, head acetylcholinesterase, abdomen glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and midgut alkaline phosphatase, which are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, the nervous system, defenses against oxidative stress, metabolism and immunity, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of studying the effects of chemical cocktails based on low realistic exposure levels and developing long-term tests to reveal possible lethal and adverse sublethal interactions in honey bees and other insect pollinators. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Chlorothalonil and acetamiprid are chemical pesticides commonly used in agricultural production and have been shown to have negative effects on bee’s fitness. Despite many studies have revealed that honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae are posting a high risk on exposure to pesticides, but the toxicology information of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid on bee larvae remain limited. Results: The no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid for honey bee larvae were 4 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. Except for CarE, the enzymic activities of GST and P450 were not influenced by chlorothalonil at NOAEC, while chronic exposure to acetamiprid slightly increased the activities of the three tested enzymes at NOAEC. Further, the exposed larvae showed significantly higher expression of genes involved in a series of different toxicologically relevant process following, including caste development (Tor (GB44905), InR-2 (GB55425), Hr4 (GB47037), Ac3 (GB11637) and ILP-2 (GB10174)), immune system response (abaecin (GB18323), defensin-1 (GB19392), toll-X4 (GB50418)), and oxidative stress response (P450, GSH, GST, CarE). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the exposure to chlorothalonil and acetamiprid, even at concentrations below the NOAEC, showed potentially effects on bee larvae’s fitness, and more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect larvae fitness should be explored in the further.

AB  - Acetamiprid and ergosterol-inhibiting fungicide (EBI) are frequently applied to many flowering plants, while honey bees are pollinating agents or pollinators of the flowers. Hence honey bees are often exposed to these pesticides. But until now, the effects of theses combinations at field-realistic doses on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE.

AB  - Honey bee is an economically important insect for honey production and pollination. Frequent exposure to toxic pesticides is one of the major risk factors causing the pollinator population decline. However, age effects of honey bees on pesticide susceptibility have been largely ignored and many researchers use bees of unknown age for assessing the risk of pesticides. Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. © 2020

AB  - Imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, and glyphosate rank among the most extensively employed pesticides worldwide. The effects of these pesticides and their combined on the flight capability of Apis cerana, and the potential underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. To investigate these effects, we carried out flight mill, transcriptome, and metabolome experiments. Our findings reveal that individual acute oral treatments with pesticides, specifically 20 μL of 10 ng/g imidacloprid (0.2 ng per bee), 30 ng/g chlorpyrifos (0.6 ng per bee), and 60 ng/g glyphosate (1.2 ng per bee), did not impact the flight capability of the bees. However, when bees were exposed to a combination of two or three pesticides, a notable reduction in flight duration and distance was observed. In the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified 307 transcripts and 17 metabolites that exhibited differential expression following exposure to combined pesticides, primarily associated with metabolic pathways involved in energy regulation. Our results illuminate the intricate effects and potential hazards posed by combined pesticide exposures on bee behavior. These findings offer valuable insights into the synergistic potential of pesticide combinations and their capacity to impair bee behavior. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for comprehending the broader consequences of pesticide formulations on honey bee populations. © 2024

AB  - Despite many studies have revealed that developing honey bee (Apis mellifera) larvae are posting a high risk on exposure to insecticides, the toxicology information on bee larvae remain limited. The present study demonstrated the first assessment of the effects of no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of carbaryl (CR) and acetamiprid (ACE) on transcriptome and metabolome in honeybee larvae reared in vitro. Chronic exposure to carbaryl caused transcriptional disorders associated with oxidative stress. In addition, a series of metabolic homeostasis were disrupted by carbaryl stress, such amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism and flavone and flavonol biosynthesis. The activities of enzymic biomarkers including GST, P450, CAT, AChE and SOD were not influenced by ACE stress, while the CR exposure slightly decreased the activity of CAT and SOD. Our results clearly show that ACE and CR display different potential to modulate transcriptome and metabolome associated with their different toxicity against bee larvae. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Honeybee colony survival strongly relies on the queen to overcome worker losses exposed to combined stressors like pesticides and parasites. Queen's capacity to withstand these stressors is however very little known. The effects of the common neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid in a chronic and sublethal exposure together with the wide distributed parasite Nosema ceranae have therefore been investigated on queen's physiology and survivorship in laboratory and field conditions. Early physiological changes were observed on queens, particularly the increase of enzyme activities (catalase [CAT] and glutathione-S-transferase [GST] in the heads) related to protective responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress against pesticide and parasite alone or combined. Stressors also alter the activity of two other enzymes (carboxylesterase alpha [CaE α] and carboxylesterase para [CaE p] in the midguts) involved in metabolic and detoxification functions. Furthermore, single and combined effects of pesticide and parasite decrease survivorship of queens introduced into mating hives for three months. Because colony demographic regulation relies on queen's fertility, the compromise of its physiology and life can seriously menace colony survival under pressure of combined stressors.

AB  - Background: The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is undergoing a worldwide decline whose origin is still in debate. Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bees (Apis mellifera), as important pollinators of agricultural crops, are at risk when pesticides are used. Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of sulfoxaflor and its effect on the A. mellifera exposure. RESULTS: Initially, developmental indicators such as larval survival, pupation, and eclosion were inhibited by 5.0 mg/L (field concentration) sulfoxaflor. In the pupal stage, fat content was significantly increased, while the glycogen content decreased. In addition, A. mellifera heads were treated with 2.0 mg/L (sublethal concentration) of sulfoxaflor and analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome results indicated that 2.0 mg/L amounts of sulfoxaflor have adverse effects on the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Sulfoxaflor down-regulated the expression of many genes involved in immunity, detoxification, the myosin cytoskeleton, sensory neurons, and odor-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: Field concentration and sublethal concentration were used for the combined analysis of honeybees. The effect of sublethal concentration of sulfoxaflor on honeybees was studied for the first time from the perspective of transcriptome sequencing of honeybee head. A preliminary study was carried out on the stress of sulfoxaflor at sublethal concentration on honeybee workers, which has certain research significance and can provide theoretical basis for the use of sulfoxaflor in the field environment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72 h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees
AU  - Tsvetkov, N.
AU  - Zayed, A.
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a “streetlight effect” where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways; foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Sulfoxaflor is a novel sulfoximine insecticide which is widely used to control crop pests. Risk assessments have reported its high toxicity to pollinators. However, sulfoxaflor is not persistent in the environment and few studies have addressed its negative effects on larval and newly emerged honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, the sublethal effects of a sulfoxaflor commercial product, Isoclast™ Active, were evaluated in the laboratory using larvae and newly emerged worker honeybees. The results of 96-h acute toxicity showed that Isoclast is moderately toxic to adult bees, and it could induce significant death and growth failure of larvae after continuous dietary intake. In addition, Isoclast induced significant changes in antioxidative (SOD, CAT), lipid peroxidation (POD, LPO, MDA), detoxification (GST, GR, GSH) and signal transduction-related (AChE, ACh) enzymes or products both in larvae and adult honey bees under residue levels. Here we firstly reported the lethal and sublethal effects of commercial sulfoxaflor to honeybees’ larvae and young workers. All these findings revealed the potential risks of sulfoxaflor residue in environment to honey bees, and may also to other pollinators. This is a laboratory mimic studies, and further studies are still needed to investigate the risks and in-depth mechanisms of sulfoxaflor to bees in field. © 2021

AB  - There are increasing concerns regarding the impact of agrochemical pesticides on non-target organisms. Pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. However, knowledge of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide in beekeeping practice, influencing on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development is lacking. Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group. The data is the first report of neurotoxic effects on honeybee caused by carbendazim, and the sublethal carbendazim may disturb honeybee development and is a potential chemical threating the honeybee colonies. © 2018 Wang, Fan, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Yin, Gao, Chen and Ji.

AB  - Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in agriculture. Its impact on honeybees has received worldwide attention. Foliar sprays are commonly and frequently used for piercing insect control, particularly on cotton in southern USA. To simulate field exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise                             ®                              2Fl), we used a modified spray tower to treat honeybee workers and monitored five enzyme activities and survival for up to 52 days. Results indicated that spray treatments twice a week for 52 days with 0.001 and 1 mg/L and once a week for three weeks with 4.3 mg/L Advise showed no adverse effect on bee survival, where imidacloprid-treated bees could live as long as untreated bees. Concentration ≥80 mg/L significantly reduced bee survival, and substantial number of bees continued to die after 48-hr of post-treatment period which was commonly used for measuring insecticide toxicity. The body weight of imidacloprid-treated bees (at LC                             20                              and LC                             50                             ) was also significantly reduced. Enzymatic data showed that activities of detoxification enzymes esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST), insecticide-target enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and honey enzyme invertase in imidacloprid-treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in untreated bees. The immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activity in imidacloprid-treated survivors was also mostly similar to that of untreated control, but higher PO activity was detected in bees treated with higher concentrations for 3 weeks. By using both bioassays and enzymatic assays, this study revealed long-term noneffective and effective concentrations of imidacloprid that may be useful for accurate assessment of toxicity risk of neonicotinoids to bees.

AB  - Thiamethoxam is an insecticide mainly used in agriculture to control insect pests. However, non-target insect species, such as honeybees, may also be impacted. In this study, adults of Apis mellifera intermissa were orally exposed under laboratory conditions to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (CL25= 0.17 ng/μl) for 9 days and the effects were evaluated at the biochemical level, by monitoring specific oxidative stress and neuronal biomarkers. Results showed an increase in the antioxidant enzymes, glutatione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and in content of malondialdehyde (MDA). The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was downregulated as evidence of a neurotoxic action and no significant change was observed in glutathione (GSH). Exposure to the insecticide thiamethoxam induced oxidative stress and defense mechanisms affecting honeybee physiology. © 2022

AB  - The toxicity and biochemical changes in honey bees (Apis mellifera) treated with four insecticides—acetamiprid, dinotefuran, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl—were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Foraging bees were exposed to different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0.01-, 0.02-, 0.04-, 0.1-, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24 h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance. The results indicated that regardless of how the bees were exposed to insecticides, dinotefuran was extremely toxic to adult A. mellifera (topical LD50 = 0.0006 μg/bee and oral feeding LC50 = 1.29 mg/L). Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to dinotefuran at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and pymetrozine were relatively less toxic to bees (<25 % mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera. The biochemical analysis of carboxylesterase and GST showed that these enzymes detoxified the low doses of acetamiprid, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl, but not dinotefuran. Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.

AB  - The use of insecticides has become increasingly frequent, and studies indicate that these compounds are involved in the intoxication of bees. Imidacloprid is a widely used neonicotinoid; thus, we have highlighted the importance of assessing its oral toxicity to Africanized bees and used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the sublethal effects in the brain, the target organ, and the midgut, responsible for the digestion/absorption of food. In addition, the distribution of proteins involved in important biological processes in the brain were evaluated on the 1st day of exposure by MALDI-imaging analysis. Bioassays were performed to determine the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid to bees, and the value obtained was 1.4651 ng imidacloprid/mu L diet. Based on this result, the sublethal concentration to be administered at 1, 4 and 8 days was established as a hundredth (1/100) of the LC50. The results obtained from the ultrastructural analysis showed alterations in the midgut cells of bees as nuclear and mitochondrial damage and an increase of vacuoles. The insecticide caused spacing among the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies, chromatin condensation and loss of mitochondrial cristae. The MALDI-imaging analysis showed an increase in the expression of such proteins as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, amyloid protein precursor and protein kinase C, which are related to oxygen supply, neuronal degeneration and memory/learning, and a decrease in the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 1, which is fundamental to the synapses. These alterations demonstrated that imidacloprid could compromise the viability of the midgut epithelium, as well as inhibiting important cognitive processes in individuals, and may be reflected in losses of the colony.

AB  - The use of insecticides, especially neonicotinoids (NEOCs), poses a significant threat to honey bees, thus prompting the EU to ban all outdoor uses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam. However, due to the persistence of NEOCs, as well as the fact that certain NEOCs are in use in some areas of the world, exposure to them is still an on-going issue. In the present study, we used laboratory acute toxicity test to examine the effects of sublethal concentrations (resulting in consumed doses approximately 50, 20, and 5 times below LD50) of thiacloprid and clothianidin on selected parameters of antioxidative defense (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase activities), oxidative status (reduced glutathione, protein thiols, malondialdehyde), neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase activity), and immune response (prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities) in honey bees. Results indicated that both neonicotinoids’ sublethal concentrations promote oxidative stress in honey bees and affect their immune defense. NEOCs impair detoxification abilities through reduced glutathione S-transferase activity, as well as disturb immune response due to decreased prophenoloxidase and phenoloxidase activities, which can explain the high toxicity of these substances to honey bees. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Securing food supply for a growing population is a major challenge and heavily relies on the use of agrochemicals to maximize crop yield. It is increasingly recognized, that some neonicotinoid insecticides have a negative impact on non-target organisms, including important pollinators such as the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honeybee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee viability are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide carbendazim and the herbicide glyphosate. We also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honeybee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: (i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), (ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, which are important for neuronal function. Our results showed that acute thiamethoxam exposure is not enhanced by carbendazim, nor glyphosate. Toxicity of the compounds did not trigger stress-induced, alternative splicing in the analysed mRNAs, thereby leaving dormant a cellular response pathway to these man-made environmental perturbations.

AB  - Maximizing crop yields relies on the use of agrochemicals to control insect pests. One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria. Our findings imply a synergistic mechanism for the observed bee population declines that concern agriculturists, conservation ecologists and the public. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Honey bees that leave the hive and collect nectar or pollen from pesticide-treated plants are susceptible to be poisoned. Acetamiprid is a new class of insecticide and a member of the neonicotinoids that has been widely applied in the field for pest control. However, effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on worker bees are not yet fully understood. In this study, we examined effects of sublethal doses of acetamiprid on lifespan and memory-related characteristics. Newly emerged worker bees from a single colony were randomly divided into four groups, and this experiment was repeated three times using three different colonies. Three doses (0.5, 1, and 2 μg/bee) of acetamiprid diluted by water were added on the thorax of worker bees while bees were exposed to pure water as a control (0 μg/bee). The lifespan of bees treated with acetamiprid at a concentration over 1 μg/bee was significantly reduced, while there was no significant difference between the 0.5 μg/bee group and 0 μg/bee group. All three doses of acetamiprid affected the memory-related characteristics of bees, reduced the success of proboscis extension response (PER), affected homing ability, and influenced expression levels of two learning- and memory-related genes compared with the control group. This research confirms that sublethal doses of acetamiprid affect the survival of honey bees. © 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Under laboratory conditions, the effects of thiamethoxam were investigated in larvae, pupae and emerging honey bees after exposure at larval stages with different concentrations in the food (0.00001 ng/μL, 0.001 ng/μL and 1.44 ng/μL). Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony. These results showed that attention should be paid to the exposure to pesticides during the developmental stages of the honey bee. This study represents the first investigation of the effects of thiamethoxam on the development of A. mellifera following larval exposure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The immune system of honeybees includes multiple pathways that may be affected by pesticide exposure decreasing the immune competencies of bees and increasing their susceptibility to diseases like the fungal Nosema spp. infection, which is detected in collapsed colonies. Methods: To better understand the effect of the co-presence of multiple pesticides that interact with bees like imidacloprid and amitraz, we evaluated the expression of immune-related genes in honeybee hemocytes. Results: Imidacloprid, amitraz, and the immune activator, zymosan A, mainly affect the gene expression in the Toll pathway. Discussion: Imidacloprid, amitraz, and zymosan A have a synergistic or an antagonistic relationship on gene expression depending on the level of immune signaling. The presence of multiple risk factors like pesticides and pathogens requires the assessment of their complex interaction, which has differential effects on the innate immunity of honeybees as seen in this study.

AB  - Neonicotinoids have been described as toxic to bees. In this context, the A. mellifera foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100: 0,0227 ng de thiamethoxam/μL−1 diet), a neurotoxic insecticide, for 8 days; and it was decided to investigate the insecticide effect on the brain by a shotgun proteomic approach followed by label-free quantitative-based proteomics. A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism. Our scientific outcomes demonstrated that a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam can impair biological processes and important metabolic pathways, causing damage to the nervous system of bees, and in the long term, can compromise the nutrition and physiology of individuals from the colony. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Bees experience substantial colony losses, which are often associated with pesticides. Besides synthetic insecticides biological compounds such as spinosad are used in agriculture and organic farming against insect pests. However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in agriculture. In this study, we used feeding methods to simulate in-hive exposures of formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and mixtures with six representative pesticides for different classes. Advise, fed at 4.3 mg/L (equal to maximal residue detection of 912 ppb active ingredient [a.i.] in pollen) induced 36% mortality and 56% feeding suppression after 2-week feeding. Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (γ-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-Transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-Treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-Treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.). Our data demonstrated that residue levels of seven pesticide in pollens/hive may not adversely affect honey bees, but long term exclusive ingestion of the maximal residue levels of imidacloprid (912 ppb) and sulfoxaflor (3 ppm a.i.) may induce substantial bee mortality. Rotating with other insecticides is a necessary and practical way to reduce the residue level of any given pesticide.

AB  - Malnutrition is one of the main problems related to the global mass collapse of honey bee colonies, because in honey bees, malnutrition is associated with deterioration of the immune system and increased pesticide susceptibility. Another important cause of mass bee colonies losses is the use of pesticides. Therefore, the goal of this study was to verify the influence of polyphenols on longevity, food consumption, and cytochrome P450 gene expression in worker bees intoxicated by thiacloprid. The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Insect pollinators are routinely exposed to a complex mixture of many pesticides. However, traditional environmental risk assessment is only carried out based on ecotoxicological data of single substances. In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L−1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L−1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators. Meanwhile, the activities of SOD, caspase 3, caspase 9, and PPO, as well as the expressions of six genes (abaecin, dorsal-2, defensin-2, vtg, caspase-1, and CYP6AS14) associated with oxidative stress, immune response, lifespan, cell apoptosis, and detoxification metabolism were noteworthily varied in the individual and mixture challenges than at the baseline level. These data revealed that it is imminently essential to investigate the combined toxicity of pesticides since the toxicity evaluation from individual compounds toward honey bees may underestimate the toxicity in realistic conditions. Overall, the present results could help understand the potential contribution of pesticide mixtures to the decline of bee populations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Apis mellifera plays crucial roles in maintaining the balance of global ecosystems and stability of agricultural systems by helping pollination of flowering plants, including many crops. In recent years, this balance has been disrupted greatly by some pesticides, which results in great losses of honeybees worldwide. Previous studies have found that pesticide-caused memory loss might be one of the major reasons for colony loss. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases and are known to cause hyperacetylation of histone cores and influence gene expression. In our study, the HDACi sodium butyrate was applied to honeybees as a dietary supplement. The effect of sodium butyrate on the expression profiles of memory-related genes was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results revealed that this HDACi had up-regulation effects on most of the memory-related genes in bees, even in bees treated with imidacloprid. In addition, using the proboscis extension reflex to evaluate olfactory learning in bees, we found that this HDACi boosted the memory formation of bees after impairment owing to imidacloprid exposure. This study investigated the association between gene expression and memory formation from an epigenetic perspective. Additionally, we further demonstrate the possibility of enhancing bee learning using HDACis and provide initial data for future research.

AB  - Pesticide application can have an adverse effect on pollinator honey bees, Apis mellifera L., ranging from mortality to sublethal effects. Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells. These findings of the present study showed that sulfoxaflor could have an adverse effect on A. mellifera. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The concern about pesticide exposure to neotropical bees has been increasing in the last few years, and knowledge gaps have been identified. Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./μL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level. Therefore, interference of different cellular processes directly affects the health of M. scutellaris by compromising the function of Mt. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Pesticide exposure remains one of the main factors in the population decline of insect pollinators. It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L−1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L−1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees. Our study also provides important guidance for the rational application of pesticide mixtures to protect pollinators in agricultural production effectively. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study was intended to evaluate the responses of enzymes in the honeybee Apis mellifera after exposure to deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad and their use as biomarkers. After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively). The responses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaEs-1-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP. Thus, this set of honeybee biomarkers appears to be a promising tool to evaluate environmental and honeybee health, and it could generate fingerprints to characterize exposures to pesticides.

AB  - The increasing use of insecticides, promoted by the intensification of agriculture, has raised concerns about their influence on the decline of bee colonies, which play a fundamental role in pollination. Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/μL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees. They may be used in combination as a promising tool for characterizing bee exposure to insecticides. © 2021

AB  - Neonicotinoids are effective insecticides used on many important arable and horticultural crops. They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers. We found numerous genes which show differential expression between neonicotinoid-treated bees and control bees, but no differentially methylated cytosines in any context. We found CpG methylation to be focused mainly in exons and associated with highly expressed genes. We discuss the implications of our results for future legislation.

AB  - Bees play a crucial role as pollinating insects in both natural and cultivated areas. However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/μL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen. GST activity showed differences in the abdomen after one and five days of thiamethoxam exposure. These findings suggests that the abdomen is more affected than the head after oral exposure to thiamethoxam. Our study provides evidence of the toxicity of thiamethoxam at both the cellular and organismal levels, reinforcing the need to include non-Apis species in pollinator risk assessments. and provide solid arguments for bee protection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Although the neonicotinoid insecticides have good selectivity towards insects rather than vertebrates, they have severe effects on honeybee production and pollination activities. Therefore, the effects of imidacloprid (IMI), the most used neonicotinoid, on the two main bioreceptors, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (nAChRα1) of honeybees were examined to identify their roles in honeybee toxicity and possible binding sites which assist in selecting and designing neonicotinoids. In vivo, IMI showed a high inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 5.63 mg/L); however, the effect was much lower in vitro experiment (IC50 719 mg/L). This result induced us to examine the IMI effect on AChE gene expression which revealed that the AChE-2 gene expression was severely affected by IMI explaining the observed high enzyme inhibition. In addition, although toxicity increased by increasing exposure to IMI (LC50 2.9 mg/L after 4h and 0.75 mg/L after 48h), AChE was not elevated (IC50 5.63 and 5.52 mg/L respectively). Besides, Despite resuming most enzyme activity (77% during 2 h and 84.14% after 4 h), a high mortality level was observed with LC50 2.9 mg/L. These results reinforced that the observed high toxicity is a multifactor process. Accordingly, Molecular modeling and docking of IMI into honeybee AChE and nAChRα1were also performed to examine their possible interactions and identify the important binding sites. Results models indicated that the first two binding sites in AChE were found in the esteratic subunit in the active site explaining the observed in vitro inhibition. In nAChRα1, four of the highest five free energy binding sites are located in the large TM3-TM4 loop and one in the extracellular loops. Consequently, the present work revealed that IMI toxicity is attributed to various factors including direct interaction with both AChE and nAChRα1 as well as downregulating AChE-2 gene expression. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sulfoxaflor (SULF), a well-known alternative for the banned neonicotinoids, is not environmentally persistent, yet numerous studies using field-realistic levels have demonstrated its detrimental impact on honey bee colonies. Despite this, even just a limited number of studies have addressed its residue-level effects on the physiological and immunological biomarkers of foraging honey bees in semi-field conditions. In the present study, we determined the LT50 of sulfoxaflor (Closer™ 24% SC) on forager bees in the laboratory at concentrations that were 12 to 300,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration. Following that, we exposed bee colonies in a semi-field in-hive experiment for 21 days to a concentration that is 600,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration to assess potential effects on the physiological state of honey bee foragers. To do that, a total of six colonies were treated with Closer™ (0.3 µg a.i./L) or control treatment, and the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glucose oxidase (GOX), and carboxylesterase (CaEs) in head tissues and invertase (IV), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the midgut tissues of forager bees were assessed at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-day post-exposure. The LT50 results for the least and greatest concentrations of Closer™ were 0.37 and 74.3 h, respectively. Furthermore, all measured physiological and immunological biomarkers were negatively impacted in the chronic exposure to 0.3 µg a.i./L concentration of Closer™. This data demonstrated the importance of reviewing the risk assessment of various sulfoxaflor formulations on bees and rephrasing the legislation that governs how beekeepers deal with sulfoxaflor-sprayed fields. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

T2  - PHYSIOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Exposure of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) to pesticides disturbed normal physiological and behavioral functions required for normal foraging and colony maintenance. The present study was aimed towards establishing the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of three pesticides viz. carbamate (carbaryl), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) in honeybees through feeding bioassay laboratory trial. Deleteriousness was confirmed through mortality rate, number of survival bees, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), total protein (TP) levels, AChE gene transcription level, and gut tissues histological analysis of exposed honeybees. Mean mortality rate was calculated for 96 h interval at three different concentrations of tested pesticides (5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg L-1), and LC50 values calculated for 48 and 96 h interval. AChE enzyme and TP level are determined by ELIZA and spectrophotometer, respectively. Results revealed that imidacloprid had the lowest LC50 (0.477 ng/bee) values as compared with carbaryl and chlorpyrifos. High mortality rate was observed at highest dose, being impidacloprid have more lethal effects as compared with other pesticides. Similarly, biochemical analysis revealed that imidiacloprid and chlorpyrifos significantly (P <= 0.05) increased AChE and TP levels, whereas carbaryl significantly (P <= 0.05) decreased them. Similarly, probe based RT qPCR revealed that imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatments significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the AChE level whereas carbaryl decreased it. Histological analysis showed that the gut tissues of honeybees exposed to pesticide treatment had substantial morphological abnormalities. In a nutshell, imidacloprid, carbaryl and chlorpyrifos have substantial toxic effects on all the study attributes of honeybees with imidacloprid being most toxic.

AB  - In agricultural ecosystems, bees are exposed to combinations of pesticides that may have been applied at different times. For example, bees visiting a flowering crop may be chronically exposed to low concentrations of systemic insecticides applied before bloom and then to a pulse of fungicide, considered safe for bees, applied during bloom. In this study, we simulate this scenario under laboratory conditions with females of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis L. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide, Confidor® (imidacloprid) at a realistic concentration, and of a pulse (1 day) exposure of the fungicide Folicur® SE (tebuconazole) at field application rate. Syrup consumption, survival, and four biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were evaluated at two different time points. An integrated biological response (IBRv2) index was elaborated with the biomarker results. The fungicide pulse had no impact on survival but temporarily reduced syrup consumption and increased the IBRv2 index, indicating potential molecular alterations. The neonicotinoid significantly reduced syrup consumption, survival, and the neurological activity of the enzymes. The co-exposure neonicotinoid-fungicide did not increase toxicity at the tested concentrations. AChE proved to be an efficient biomarker for the detection of early effects for both the insecticide and the fungicide. Our results highlight the importance of assessing individual and sub-individual endpoints to better understand pesticide effects on bees. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The honey bee is economically significant insect and plays an important role in the pollination of various plants. With regard to the widespread use of pesticides in agricultural lands, honey bees, as non-target and useful insect, inadvertently contact these chemicals. Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of some pesticides, the toxicity of three insecticides from different chemical classes including imidacloprid (0.16 mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47 mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500 mg a.i./l) on detoxifying enzymes of worker honey bees and mortality of immature bees was investigated. These chemicals were selected because they are used globally and ingested by honey bees. The sub-lethal concentration of imidacloprid reduced the activity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Exposure to the sub-lethal concentrations of the ethion reduced the esterase (EST) activities in treated honey bees. Exposure of honey bee larvae to imidacloprid (0.16 mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47 mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500 mg a.i./l) increased the mortality of the treated group compared to untreated controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that imidacloprid and ethion disrupt the physiology of honey bees, thereby reducing the efficiency of this beneficial pollinator. Also, it is important that additional studies be performed to investigate the sub-lethal effects of pesticides on larval development. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The potential toxicity of flupyradifurone (FPF) to honey bees has been a subject of controversy in recent years. Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees. Therefore, flupyradifurone should be considered for its application in crops.

AB  - The honeybees are the most important pollinator in the production of crops and fresh produce. Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress. Understanding how low temperature stress affects the physiology of bee brain development and how it affects bee behavior provide a theoretical foundation for a deeper comprehension of the temperature adaptation mechanism that underlies the "stenothermic" development of social insects, and help to improve honeybee management strategies to ensure the healthy of colony.

AU  - Simmons, W.R.

T2  - Scientific Reports
AB  - Bumblebees are important pollinators in wild and agricultural settings. In recent decades pollinator declines have been linked to the effects of increased pesticide use and the spread of disease. Synergy between these factors has been suggested, but no physiological mechanism has been identified. This study examines the connection between neonicotinoid exposure and innate immune function in the bumblebee Bombus impatiens, which is an important wild and commercial pollinator in eastern North America. Experimental colonies in the field were enclosed and provided pollen and sugar syrup containing an agriculturally relevant range of imidacloprid concentrations. Bumblebees were collected from colonies over four weeks, and the expression of antimicrobial peptides was measured using multiplex quantitative real time PCR. Significant increases in the expression of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptaecin were found over time in treatments receiving moderate to high concentrations of the pesticide. Responses were dependent on time of exposure and dose. These results indicate that immune function in bumblebees is affected by neonicotinoid exposure and suggest a physiological mechanism by which neonicotinoids may impact the innate immune function of bumblebee pollinators in wild and agricultural habitats. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Floral resource loss and pesticide exposure are major threats to bees in intensively managed agroecosystems, but interactions among these drivers remain poorly understood. Altered composition and lowered diversity of pollen nutrition may reinforce negative pesticide impacts on bees. Here we investigated the development and survival of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis provisioned with three different pollen types, as well as a mixture of these types representing a higher pollen diversity. We exposed bees of each nutritional treatment to five pesticides at different concentrations in the laboratory. Two field-realistic concentrations of three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) modulating insecticides (thiacloprid, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone), as well as of two fungicides (azoxystrobin and tebuconazole) were examined. We further measured the expression of two detoxification genes (CYP9BU1, CYP9BU2) under exposure to thiacloprid across different nutrition treatments as a potential mechanistic pathway driving pesticide-nutrition interactions. We found that more diverse pollen nutrition reduced development time, enhanced pollen efficacy (cocoon weight divided by consumed pollen weight) and pollen consumption, and increased weight of O. bicornis after larval development (cocoon weight). Contrary to fungicides, high field-realistic concentrations of all three insecticides negatively affected O. bicornis by extending development times. Moreover, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone also reduced pollen efficacy and cocoon weight, and sulfoxaflor reduced pollen consumption and increased mortality. The expression of detoxification genes differed across pollen nutrition types, but was not enhanced after exposure to thiacloprid. Our findings highlight that lowered diversity of pollen nutrition and high field-realistic exposure to nAChR modulating insecticides negatively affected the development of O. bicornis, but we found no mitigation of negative pesticide impacts through increased pollen diversity. These results have important implications for risk assessment for bee pollinators, indicating that negative effects of nAChR modulating insecticides to developing solitary bees are currently underestimated. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Exposure to agrochemicals and pathogens has been indicated as critical factors of declining pollinator populations, including species of native tropical bees. In the present study, we investigated the sublethal effects of acute oral exposure to azadirachtin and spinosad bioinsecticides on the expression of immunity-related genes and the number of hemocytes in uninfected and Escherichia coli-infected workers of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata. Expression of the immune-related gene vitellogenin decreased and the number of circulating hemocytes increased in bioinsecticide-exposed uninfected bees and in unexposed E. coli-infected bees as compared with unexposed uninfected bees. Our results show that though bioinsecticides are considered safe, contamination by sublethal doses of azadirachtin and spinosad can interfere with the immune system of bees.

T2  - Scientific Reports
AB  - In this study, we conducted a transcriptional analysis of five honey bee genes to examine their functional involvement vis-à-vis ambient temperatures and exposure to imidacloprid. In a 15-day cage experiment, three cohorts of one-day-old sister bees emerged in incubators, were distributed into cages, and maintained at three different temperatures (26 °C, 32 °C, 38 °C). Each cohort was fed a protein patty and three concentrations of imidacloprid-tainted sugar (0 ppb, 5 ppb and 20 ppb) ad libitum. Honey bee mortality, syrup and patty consumption were monitored daily over 15 days. Bees were sampled every three days for a total of five time points. RT-qPCR was used to longitudinally assess gene regulation of Vg, mrjp1, Rsod, AChE-2 and Trx-1 using RNA extracted from whole bee bodies. Kaplan–Meier models show that bees kept at both non-optimal temperatures (26 °C and 38 °C) were more susceptible to imidacloprid, with significantly higher mortality (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the control. At 32 °C, no differences in mortality (P = 0.3) were recorded among treatments. In both imidacloprid treatment groups and the control, the expression of Vg and mrjp1 was significantly downregulated at 26 °C and 38 °C compared to the optimal temperature of 32 °C, indicating major influence of ambient temperature on the regulation of these genes. Within the ambient temperature groups, both imidacloprid treatments exclusively downregulated Vg and mrjp1 at 26 °C. AChE-2 and the poorly characterized Rsod gene were both consistently upregulated at the highest temperature (38 °C) compared to the ideal temperature (32 °C) in all treatment groups. Trx-1 showed no effect to both temperature and imidacloprid treatments and was regulated in an age-related manner. Overall, our results indicate that ambient temperatures amplify imidacloprid toxicity and affect honey bee gene regulation. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Bees are simultaneously exposed to a variety of pesticides, which are often applied in mixtures and can cause lethal and sublethal effects. The combined effects of pesticides, however, are not measured in the current risk assessment schemes. Additionally, the sublethal effects of pesticides on a variety of physiological processes are poorly recognized in bees, especially in non-Apis solitary bees. In this study, we used a full-factorial design to examine the main and interactive effects of three insecticide formulations with different modes of action (Mospilan 20 SP, Sherpa 100 EC, and Dursban 480 EC) on bee biochemical processes. We measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) activities, as well as a nonenzymatic biomarker associated with energy metabolism, i.e., ATP level. All studied endpoints were affected by Sherpa 100 EC, and the activities of AChE and EST as well as ATP levels were affected by Dursban 480 EC. Moreover, complex interactions between all three insecticides affected ATP levels, showing outcomes that cannot be predicted when testing each insecticide separately. The results indicate that even if interactive effects are sometimes difficult to interpret, there is a need to study such interactions if laboratory-generated toxicity data are to be extrapolated to field conditions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety
AB  - The physiological and biochemical stress induced by pesticides need to be addressed in economically and ecologically important non-Apis solitary bees, particularly at lower than field-applied concentrations. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyse the physiological and biochemical changes in female adult Osmia bicornis bees upon continuous oral exposure to three insecticide-based agrochemicals – i.e. Dursban 480 EC (active ingredient - a.i. chlorpyrifos), Sherpa 100 EC (a.i. cypermethrin), and Mospilan 20 SP (a.i. acetamiprid), in a toxicokinetic manner (feeding with either insecticide-contaminated food or uncontaminated food (controls) for 8 d in the contamination phase followed by 8 d of decontamination (i.e. feeding with uncontaminated food)). All three tested agrochemicals altered the energetic budget of bees by the deprivation of energy derived from lipids and carbohydrates (but not proteins) and/or a decrease in respiration based metabolic rate (energy consumption) compared to the controls. The activities of acetylcholinesterase and glutathione-S-transferase enzymes were not altered by insecticides at tested concentrations. These results show that chronic exposure to at least some pesticides even at relatively low concentrations may cause severe physiological disruptions that could potentially be damaging for the solitary bees. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - With the rising occurrence of sudden heat waves, honey bees are at risk of exposure to unprecedented heat stress. We investigated the synergistic effects of imidacloprid (IMD) and high temperature on honey bees. Mini hives were treated with IMD (20 ppb for 14 days) and high temperature (41 °C for 6 h) either singly or in combination. Heat shock protein 70 and 90 genes were upregulated in bees exposed to the combined treatment compared to those exposed to each single treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that metabolic pathways remained intact in the high temperature treatment, whereas several metabolic pathways were altered by either the IMD treatment (downregulation of cellular respiration pathways) or the combined treatment (upregulation of protein synthesis and signaling pathways). These findings suggest that IMD and high temperature have negative synergistic effects on honey bees. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The neonicotinoid thiamethoxam is widely used in different agricultural crops, and it has a spectrum of action against insects, affecting both pests and pollinators, such as bees. In this study, the effects of exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam on stingless bees Scaptotrigona bipunctata were evaluated. Foragers bees were exposed to the insecticide and subjected to genetic biochemical, histochemical, and morphological analyses after 24, 48, and 72 h of ingestion. Analysis of isoenzyme esterases revealed significant alterations in the relative activity of EST-4, a type II cholinesterase. Evaluation of the S. bipunctata brain revealed changes in the state of chromatin condensation according to the exposure time and concentration of neonicotinoid compared with the control. Morphological changes were observed in the midgut of this species at all concentrations and exposure times, which may interfere with various physiological processes of these insects. We can conclude that, although thiamethoxam at the concentrations evaluated did not cause high mortality, it induced concentration-dependent changes in bees by activating enzymes related with the protection for xenobiotic, internal morphology and probably these changes may lead to alterations in the activity of bees. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In Québec, as observed globally, abnormally high honey bee mortality rates have been reported recently. Several potential contributing factors have been identified, and exposure to pesticides is of increasing concern. In maize fields, foraging bees are exposed to residual concentrations of insecticides such as neonicotinoids used for seed coating. Highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoids are also reported to increase AChE activity in other invertebrates exposed to sub-lethal doses. The purpose of this study was therefore to test if the honey bee's AChE activity could be altered by neonicotinoid compounds and to explore possible effects of other common products used in maize fields: atrazine and glyphosate. One week prior to pollen shedding, beehives were placed near three different field types: certified organically grown maize, conventionally grown maize or non-cultivated. At the same time, caged bees were exposed to increasing sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and clothianidin) and herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) under controlled conditions. While increased AChE activity was found in all fields after 2 weeks of exposure, bees close to conventional maize crops showed values higher than those in both organic maize fields and non-cultivated areas. In caged bees, AChE activity increased in response to neonicotinoids, and a slight decrease was observed by glyphosate. These results are discussed with regard to AChE activity as a potential biomarker of exposure for neonicotinoids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The registration of novel pesticides that are subsequently banned because of their unexpected negative effects on non-target species can have a huge environmental impact. Therefore, the pre-emptive evaluation of the potential effects of new compounds is essential. To this aim both lethal and sublethal effects should be assessed in a realistic scenario including the other stressors that can interact with pesticides. However, laboratory studies addressing such interactive effects are rare, while standardized laboratory-based protocols focus on lethal effects and not on sub-lethal effects. We propose to assess both lethal and sublethal effects in a multifactorial context including the other stressors affecting the non-target species. We tested this approach by studying the impact on honey bees of the insecticide sulfoxaflor in combination with a common parasite, a sub-optimal temperature and food deprivation. We studied the survival and the transcriptome of honey bees, to assess both the lethal and the potential sublethal effects of the insecticide, respectively. With this method we show that a field realistic concentration of sulfoxaflor in food does not affect the survival of honey bees; however, the significant impact on some key genes indicates that sublethal effects are possible in a realistically complex scenario. Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a novel approach to hazard assessment considering the interactive effects of pesticides. We anticipate our approach to be a starting point for a paradigm shift in toxicology: from an unifactorial, mortality-centered assessment to a multifactorial, comprehensive approach. This is something of the utmost importance to preserve pollination, thus contributing to the sustainability of our food production system. © 2024

AB  - The effects of pesticide mixtures and electric and magnetic fields on honeybees were evaluated in three experimental sites located in northern Italy: a control site far from anthropogenic-stress sources, a semi-natural site close to a high-voltage electric line and an agricultural site with intensive pesticide use. From each experimental site, young workers and foraging bees were taken monthly from May to October and analyzed for four enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The results revealed time- and site-specific effects in respect to control site, confirming the role of biomarkers as diagnostic and early-warning tools for multi-stress sources on honeybees. In the electromagnetic-stress site, the effect of an over-activation of all analyzed biomarkers was observed at the end of the season. According to other literature findings, this event was related to a behavioral over-activation in a period in which bees should prepare themselves for overwintering. This finding poses potential problems for winter survival. In the pesticide-stress site, different pesticide-induced responses were identified. We demonstrated in the field that pesticide mixtures currently used in agriculture could greatly affect the biochemical parameters of bees (with both enzymatic under- and over-activations).

AB  - Apis cerana is an important pollinator of agricultural crops in China. In the agricultural environment, A. cerana may be exposed to acetamiprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) and difenoconazole (triazole fungicide), alone or in combination because they are commonly applied to various crops. At present, our understanding of the toxicological effects of acetamiprid and difenoconazole on honey bee gut microbiomes is limited. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether these two pesticides affect honey bees’ gut microbiota and to analyze the transcriptional effects of these two pesticides on honey bees’ head and gut. In this study, adults of A. cerana were exposed to acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole by contaminated syrup at field-realistic concentrations for 10 days. Results indicated that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole chronic exposure did not affect honey bees’ survival and food consumption, whereas difenoconazole decreased the weight of honey bees. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that difenoconazole and the mixture of difenoconazole and acetamiprid decreased the diversity index and shaped the composition of gut bacteria microbiota, whereas acetamiprid did not impact the gut bacterial community. The ITS sequence data showed that neither of the two pesticides affected the fungal community structure. Meanwhile, we also observed that acetamiprid or difenoconazole significantly altered the expression of genes related to detoxification and immunity in honey bees’ tissues. Furthermore, we observed that the adverse effect of the acetamiprid and difenoconazole mixture on honey bees’ health was greater than that of a single mixture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole exposure at field-realistic concentrations induced changes to the honey bee gut microbiome and gene expression.

TI  - Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica
AU  - Syama, P.S.

T2  - Sociobiology
AB  - Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

AB  - While honey bee exposure to systemic insecticides has received much attention, impacts on wild pollinators have not been as widely studied. Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee neuronal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report in situ that bumble bees living in agricultural areas exhibit signs of neonicotinoid intoxication.

AB  - There are multifactorial causes for the recent decline in bee populations, which has resulted in compromised pollination and reduced biodiversity. Bees are considered one of the most important non-target insects affected by insecticides used in crop production. In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to spinosad on the survival, food consumption, flight behavior, respiration rate, activity of detoxification enzymes, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), brain morphology, and hemocyte count of Apis mellifera foragers. We tested six different concentrations of spinosad for the first two analyses, followed by LC50 (7.7 mg L-1) for other assays. Spinosad ingestion decreased survival and food consumption. Exposure to spinosad LC50 reduced flight capacity, respiration rate, and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, this concentration increased glutathione S-transferase activity and the TAC of the brain. Notably, exposure to LC50 damaged mushroom bodies, reduced the total hemocyte count and granulocyte number, and increased the number of prohemocytes. These findings imply that the neurotoxin spinosad affects various crucial functions and tissues important for bee performance and that the toxic effects are complex and detrimental to individual homeostasis.

AB  - Cholinergic signaling is fundamental to neuromuscular function in most organisms. Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.

We carried out experiments to study the genetic and molecular basis of NNI tolerance in honeybees, which may underlie the dis-crepancies observed in the literature. We discovered that worker survival post -exposure to an acute oral dose of clothianidin is heritable (H2 = 37.8%). Tolerance to clothianidin was not associated with differences in the expression of detoxifica-tion enzymes in our experiments. Instead, mutations in the primary neonicotinoid detoxification genes CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q3 were strongly associated with worker survival post-clothianidin exposure. In some instances, the strong association between CYP9Q haplotypes and worker survival was associated with the pro-tein's predicted binding affinity for clothianidin. Our findings have implications regarding future toxicological studies utilizing honeybees as a model pollinator.

AB  - Dramatic losses of pollinating insects have become of global concern, as they threaten not only key ecosystem services but also human food production. Recent research provided evidence that interactions between ecological stressors are drivers of declining pollinator health and responsible for observed population collapses. We used the honeybee Apis mellifera and conducted a series of experiments to test for long-term effects of a single short exposure to the agricultural pesticide flupyradifurone to a second environmental stressor later in life. To do this, we exposed individuals during their larval development or early adulthood to sublethal dosages of flupyradifurone (0.025 mu g for larvae and 0.645 mu g for imagos), either pure or as part of an agricultural formulation (Sivanto). We afterwards exposed bees to a second ecological stressor infecting individuals with 10,000 spores of the fungal gut parasite Nosema ceranae. We found that pesticide exposures significantly reduced survival of bees and altered the expression of several immune and detoxification genes. The ability of bees to respond to these latter effects differed significantly between colonies, offering opportunities to breed bees with elevated levels of pesticide tolerance in the future. We conclude that short episodes of sublethal pesticide exposures during development are sufficient to trigger effects later in life and could therefore contribute to the widespread declines in bee health.

TI  - The novel insecticides flupyradifurone and sulfoxaflor do not act synergistically with viral pathogens in reducing honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival but sulfoxaflor modulates host immunocompetence

AB  - The decline of insect pollinators threatens global food security. A major potential cause of decline is considered to be the interaction between environmental stressors, particularly between exposure to pesticides and pathogens. To explore pesticide–pathogen interactions in an important pollinator insect, the honey bee, we used two new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (SULF), at sublethal and field-realistic doses in a fully crossed experimental design with three common viral honey bee pathogens, Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) genotypes A and B. Through laboratory experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination to individual insects, we recorded harmful effects of FPF and pathogens on honey bee survival and immune gene expression. Though we found no evidence of synergistic interactions among stressors on either honey bee survival or viral load, the combined treatment SULF and DWV-B led to a synergistic upregulation of dicer-like gene expression. We conclude that common viral pathogens pose a major threat to honey bees, while co-exposure to these novel nACHR insecticides does not significantly exacerbate viral impacts on host survival in the laboratory. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Laboratory bioassays were conducted to determine the contact honey bee toxicity of commercial and candidate neonicotinoid insecticides. The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with LD50 values of 18ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22ng for clothianidin, 30ng for thiamethoxam, 75ng for dinotefuran and 138ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with LD50 values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6μg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50μg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees. When honey bees were placed in cages in forced contact with alfalfa treated with acetamiprid and the synergist, triflumizole, in combination at their maximum recommended application rates, no mortality was detected above that of the control. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thirty-two honeybee (Apis mellifera) colonies were studied in order to detect and measure potential in vivo effects of neonicotinoid pesticides used in cornfields (Zea mays spp) on honeybee health. Honeybee colonies were randomly split on four different agricultural cornfield areas located near Quebec City, Canada. Two locations contained cornfields treated with a seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid insecticide while the two others were organic cornfields used as control treatments. Hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of two years. Honeybee viruses (brood queen cell virus BQCV, deformed wing virus DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV) and the brain specific expression of a biomarker of host physiological stress, the Acetylcholinesterase gene AChE, were investigated using RT-qPCR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to detect pesticide residues in adult bees, honey, pollen, and corn flowers collected from the studied hives in each location. In addition, general hive conditions were assessed by monitoring colony weight and brood development. Neonicotinoids were only identified in corn flowers at low concentrations. However, honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid treated cornfields expressed significantly higher pathogen infection than those located in untreated cornfields. AChE levels showed elevated levels among honeybees that collected corn pollen from treated fields. Positive correlations were recorded between pathogens and the treated locations. Our data suggests that neonicotinoids indirectly weaken honeybee health by inducing physiological stress and increasing pathogen loads.

AB  - Large-scale losses of honey bee colonies represent a poorly understood problem of global importance. Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-κB immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-κB activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-κB signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.

AB  - Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are ecologically, agriculturally, and economically important plant pollinators. High average annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US have been partially attributed to agrochemical exposure and virus infections. To examine the potential negative synergistic impacts of agrochemical exposure and virus infection, as well as the potential promise of phytochemicals to ameliorate the impact of pathogenic infections on honey bees, we infected bees with a panel of viruses (i.e., Flock House virus, deformed wing virus, or Sindbis virus) and exposed to one of three chemical compounds. Specifically, honey bees were fed sucrose syrup containing: (1) thyme oil, a phytochemical and putative immune stimulant, (2) fumagillin, a beekeeper applied fungicide, or (3) clothianidin, a grower-applied insecticide. We determined that virus abundance was lower in honey bees fed 0.16 ppm thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup, compared to bees fed sucrose syrup alone. Parallel analysis of honey bee gene expression revealed that honey bees fed thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup had higher expression of key RNAi genes (argonaute-2 and dicer-like), antimicrobial peptide expressing genes (abaecin and hymenoptaecin), and vitellogenin, a putative honey bee health and age indicator, compared to bees fed only sucrose syrup. Virus abundance was higher in bees fed fumagillin (25 ppm or 75 ppm) or 1 ppb clothianidin containing sucrose syrup relative to levels in bees fed only sucrose syrup. Whereas, honey bees fed 10 ppb clothianidin had lower virus levels, likely because consuming a near lethal dose of insecticide made them poor hosts for virus infection. The negative impact of fumagillin and clothianidin on honey bee health was indicated by the lower expression of argonaute-2, dicer-like, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin, and vitellogenin. Together, these results indicate that chemical stimulants and stressors impact the outcome of virus infection and immune gene expression in honey bees.

AB  - Co-exposure to pesticides and viruses is likely to occur in honey bee colonies. Pesticides can be present in pollen, nectar, and persist in stored food (honey and bee bread), and viruses can be highly prevalent in honey bee colonies. Therefore, the present study describes the influence of chronic co-exposure to thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) on bee survival, virus loads, expression level of immune and detoxication genes, and pesticide metabolism Experiments were performed on honey bees collected from a winter apiary with reduced viral contaminations. No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology. © 2019 Coulon et al.

AB  - Exposure to multiple stress factors is believed to contribute to honey bee colony decline. However, little is known about how co-exposure to stress factors can alter the survival and behavior of free-living honey bees in colony conditions. We therefore studied the potential interaction between a neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, and a highly prevalent honey bee pathogen, Deformed wing virus (DWV). For this purpose, tagged bees were exposed to DWV by feeding or injection, and/or to field-relevant doses of thiamethoxam, then left in colonies equipped with optical bee counters to monitor flight activity. DWV loads and the expression of immune genes were quantified. A reduction in vitellogenin expression level was observed in DWV-injected bees and was associated with precocious onset of foraging. Combined exposure to DWV and thiamethoxam did not result in higher DWV loads compared to bees only exposed to DWV, but induced precocious foraging, increased the risk of not returning to the hive after the first flight, and decreased survival when compared to single stress exposures. We therefore provided the first evidence for deleterious interactions between DWV and thiamethoxam in natural conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Coulon, Dalmon, Di Prisco, Prado, Arban, Dubois, Ribière-Chabert, Alaux, Thiéry and Le Conte.

AB  - Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee olfaction, but few studies have investigated the sublethal effects of the enantioselective neonicotinoid dinotefuran on honey bee olfaction. This study assessed the sublethal olfactory toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honey bees. Compared to R-dinotefuran, S-dinotefuran had higher acute oral toxicity, sucrose sensitivity effects, octopamine concentrations, lower learning ability, and memory effects on honey bees. High-throughput circular RNA sequencing of the honey bee brain revealed that R-dinotefuran caused more gene regulatory changes than S-dinotefuran. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses demonstrated that the SERCA, Kca, and Maxik genes may be related to the enantioselective effects of dinotefuran isomers on honey bee olfaction. These results indicated that the current ecotoxicological safety knowledge about chiral dinotefuran effects on honey bees should be amended. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Determining the side effects of pesticides on pollinators is an important topic due to the increasing loss of pollinators. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid. The results are helpful to explain that imidacloprid impairs the cognitive functions and possesses the delayed and time cumulative effect.

AB  - With the increasing demand for pollinating services, the wellness of honeybees has received widespread attention. Recent evidence indicated honeybee health might be posed a potential threat by widely used neonicotinoids worldwide. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of these insecticides in honeybees especially at an enantiomeric level. In this study, we selected two species of bees, Apis mellifera (A. mellifera) and Apis cerana (A. cerana), to assess the toxicity and molecular mechanism of neonicotinoid dinotefuran and its enantiomers. The results showed that S-dinotefuran was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran to honeybees by oral and contact exposures as much as 114 times. A. cerana was more susceptible to highly toxic enantiomer S-dinotefuran. S-dinotefuran induced the immune system response in A. cerana after 48 h exposure and significant changes were observed in the neuronal signaling of A. mellifera under three forms of dinotefuran exposure. Moreover, molecular docking also revealed that S-dinotefuran formed more hydrogen bonds than R-dinotefuran with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, indicating the higher toxicity of S-dinotefuran. Data provided here show that R-dinotefuran may be a safer alternative to control pests and protect pollinators than rac-dinotefuran. © 2021 American Chemical Society

AB  - The toxic effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on honeybees is a global concern, whereas little is known about the effect of stereoisomeric pesticides among honeybee social behavior. In this study, we investigated the effects of stereoisomeric dinotefuran on honeybee social behavior. We found that honeybees exhibit a preference for consuming food containing S-dinotefuran, actively engage in trophallaxis with S-dinotefuran–consuming peers, and consequently acquire higher levels of S-dinotefuran compared with R-dinotefuran. In comparison to R-dinotefuran, S-dinotefuran stimulates honeybees to elevate their body temperature, thereby attracting more peers for trophallaxis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of thermogenesis pathways due to S-dinotefuran exposure. Additionally, metabolome data indicated that S-dinotefuran may enhance body temperature by promoting lipid synthesis in the lysine degradation pathway. Consequently, body temperature emerges as a key factor influencing honeybee social behavior. Our study is the first to highlight the propensity of S-dinotefuran to raise honeybee body temperature, which prompts honeybee to preferentially engage in trophallaxis with peers exhibiting higher body temperatures. This preference may lead honeybees to collect more dinotefuran-contaminated food in the wild, significantly accelerating dinotefuran transmission within a population. Proactive trophallaxis further amplifies the risk of neonicotinoid pesticide transmission within a population, making honeybees that have consumed S-dinotefuran particularly favored within their colonies. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the higher risk associated with neonicotinoid use compared with other pesticides. © 2023

AB  - The health of bee populations worldwide is affected by multiple factors, of which neonicotinoids are considered to be a main reason. Although most neonicotinoids are highly toxic to bees, some of them are relatively safe. To explore the molecular mechanism of these differences in toxicity, homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the interactions between Apis mellifera (α8)2(β1)3 nAChR and high bee-toxic neonicotinoid (imidacloprid, IMI), medium bee-toxic (thiacloprid, THI) and low bee-toxic butenolides (flupyradifurone, FPF). It was observed that three major interactions were similar across all systems, including water-bridge networks, π-π interactions and the polar interactions between the electron-withdrawing pharmacophores and the receptor. The calculated binding free energy was similar between IMI and THI. While FPF was the lowest bee-toxic, it displayed the strongest binding free energy value, the additional C–H⋯O H-bonds with Arg80 and Trp179 were the main reason. The bee toxicities of neonicotinoids and other nAChR modulators are not only determined by receptor affinities, but also by other factors (for example physicochemical properties and metabolic detoxification). All influencing factors should be fully considered in the future design of new eco-friendly insecticides that are safe for bees. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.
