616,JOUR,Toxicity and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor interaction of imidacloprid and its metabolites in Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae),"['Nauen, R.', 'Ebbinghaus-Kintscher, U.', 'Schmuck, R.']",Pest Management Science,"Acute oral and contact toxicity tests of imidacloprid, an insecticide acting agonistically on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), to adult honeybees, Apis mellifera L var carnica, were carried out by seven different European research facilities. Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and >81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (>36, >49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee). The urea metabolite and 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited LD50 values of >99 500 and >121 500ng per bee, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the [3H]imidacloprid binding site in honeybee head membrane preparations is consistent with that anticipated for a nAChR. IC50 values for the displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by several metabolites such as olefine, 5-OH-, 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, urea and 6-CNA were 0.45, 24, 6600, > 100 000, and > 100 000nM, respectively. Displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by imidacloprid revealed an IC50 value of 2.9nM, thus correlating well with the observed acute oral toxicity of the compounds in honeybees. Neurons isolated from the antennal lobe of A mellifera and subjected to whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology responded to the application of 100 μM acetylcholine with a fast inward current of between 30 and 1600 pA at -70mV clamp potential. Imidacloprid and two of the metabolites (olefine- and 5-OH-imidacloprid) acted agonistically on these neurons, whereas the others did not induce currents at test conencentrations up to 3 mM. The electrophysiological data revealed Hill coefficients of approximately 1, indicating a single binding site responsible for an activation of the receptor and no direct cooperativity or allosteric interaction with a second binding site. © 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.",2001///,2001,10.1002/ps.331,57,7,577,586,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034943098&doi=10.1002%2fps.331&partnerID=40&md5=fac70b3532284540063e9866867d0f79,Scopus,,,,,1,,1,1
825,JOUR,Imidacloprid effects on acetylcholinesterase and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in Apis mellifera. Experimental and molecular modeling approaches,"['Ali, H.M.', 'Abdel-Aty, B.', 'El-Sayed, W.', 'Mariy, F.M.', 'Hegazy, G.M.', 'Mohamed, R.A.', 'Zoghly, H.M.']",Chemosphere,"Although the neonicotinoid insecticides have good selectivity towards insects rather than vertebrates, they have severe effects on honeybee production and pollination activities. Therefore, the effects of imidacloprid (IMI), the most used neonicotinoid, on the two main bioreceptors, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (nAChRα1) of honeybees were examined to identify their roles in honeybee toxicity and possible binding sites which assist in selecting and designing neonicotinoids. In vivo, IMI showed a high inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 5.63 mg/L); however, the effect was much lower in vitro experiment (IC50 719 mg/L). This result induced us to examine the IMI effect on AChE gene expression which revealed that the AChE-2 gene expression was severely affected by IMI explaining the observed high enzyme inhibition. In addition, although toxicity increased by increasing exposure to IMI (LC50 2.9 mg/L after 4h and 0.75 mg/L after 48h), AChE was not elevated (IC50 5.63 and 5.52 mg/L respectively). Besides, Despite resuming most enzyme activity (77% during 2 h and 84.14% after 4 h), a high mortality level was observed with LC50 2.9 mg/L. These results reinforced that the observed high toxicity is a multifactor process. Accordingly, Molecular modeling and docking of IMI into honeybee AChE and nAChRα1were also performed to examine their possible interactions and identify the important binding sites. Results models indicated that the first two binding sites in AChE were found in the esteratic subunit in the active site explaining the observed in vitro inhibition. In nAChRα1, four of the highest five free energy binding sites are located in the large TM3-TM4 loop and one in the extracellular loops. Consequently, the present work revealed that IMI toxicity is attributed to various factors including direct interaction with both AChE and nAChRα1 as well as downregulating AChE-2 gene expression. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141899,356,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189431305&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.141899&partnerID=40&md5=0d59fc4d5808c83501fe2317b4746c96,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'nicotinic receptor', 'Imidacloprids', 'mortality', 'Toxicity', 'gene expression', 'down regulation', 'Honeybee', 'unclassified drug', 'animal tissue', 'in vitro study', 'metabolism', 'LC50', 'Gene expression', 'genetics', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'insect protein', 'nAChR', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'enzyme activity', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'Models, Molecular', 'molecular docking', 'molecular model', 'binding site', 'Insect Proteins', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Genes expression', 'AChE', 'animal model', 'NAChR', 'in vivo study', 'enzyme', 'nervous system', 'Binding energy', 'Alfa subunit', 'Alpha subunit', 'Binding sites', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding-sites', 'enzyme active site', 'Enzyme activity', 'enzyme inhibition', 'Enzyme inhibition', 'experimental toxicity', 'Free energy', 'Molecular modeling', 'nicotinic receptor alpha1', 'Transmembranes']",,,,1,,1,2
499,JOUR,Impairments in learning and memory performances associated with nicotinic receptor expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera after exposure to a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor,"['Cartereau, A.', 'Pineau, X.', 'Lebreton, J.', 'Mathé-Allainmat, M.', 'Taillebois, E.', 'Thany, S.H.']",PLoS ONE,"Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the Amelβ1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of Amelα9 and Amelβ2, and down-regulation of Amelα1, Amelα3 and Amelα7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affect honeybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of sulfoxaflor and its effect on the A. mellifera exposure. RESULTS: Initially, developmental indicators such as larval survival, pupation, and eclosion were inhibited by 5.0 mg/L (field concentration) sulfoxaflor. In the pupal stage, fat content was significantly increased, while the glycogen content decreased. In addition, A. mellifera heads were treated with 2.0 mg/L (sublethal concentration) of sulfoxaflor and analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome results indicated that 2.0 mg/L amounts of sulfoxaflor have adverse effects on the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Sulfoxaflor down-regulated the expression of many genes involved in immunity, detoxification, the myosin cytoskeleton, sensory neurons, and odor-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: Field concentration and sublethal concentration were used for the combined analysis of honeybees. The effect of sublethal concentration of sulfoxaflor on honeybees was studied for the first time from the perspective of transcriptome sequencing of honeybee head. A preliminary study was carried out on the stress of sulfoxaflor at sublethal concentration on honeybee workers, which has certain research significance and can provide theoretical basis for the use of sulfoxaflor in the field environment. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024///,2024,10.1002/ps.8326,80,11,5941,5953,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202068976&doi=10.1002%2fps.8326&partnerID=40&md5=f1ac3cc696efcebed199af2d398beea4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'Larva', 'growth, development and aging', 'sublethal concentration', 'transcriptome', 'Transcriptome', 'pupa', 'genetic analysis', 'physiological response', 'Pupa', 'transcriptome analysis']",,,,0,alteration of CYP6AQ1 expression,1,4

Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells.

Results indicated that A. cerana was more sensitive to imidacloprid and clothianidin than A. mellifera. The acute oral LD50 values of imidacloprid and clothianidin for A. mellifera were 8.6 and 2.0 ng/bee, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for A. cerana were 2.7 and 0.5 ng/bee.

Multiple studies have shown that these factors can interact, producing a synergistic effect that can compromise the viability of honey bees. This study analyses the interactions between different pesticides and the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and their effect on immune and detoxification gene expression, sugar consumption and mortality in the Iberian western honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). For this purpose, workers were infected with N. ceranae and subjected to a sugar-water diet with field concentrations of the pesticides sulfoxaflor, azoxystrobin and glyphosate. Increased sugar intake and altered immune and cytochrome P450 gene expression were observed in workers exposed to sulfoxaflor and infected with N. ceranae. None of the pesticides affected Nosema spore production in honey bee gut. Of the three pesticides tested (alone or in combination) only sulfoxaflor increased mortality in honey bees. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of sulfoxaflor were attenuated in contact with other pesticides, and that Nosema infection leads to increase sugar intake in sulfoxaflor-exposed bees.

How both factors affect gene expression and honey bee survival are well studied. However, only a few studies dealt with the interactions of the two factors. Here we studied the effects of both, when alone and in combination, on honey bee survival and expression changes of immune and detoxification genes. Newly emerged bees were randomly assigned four different treatments: control bees, bees exposed to thiamethoxam, bees exposed to thiamethoxam and then infected with Nosema, and bees infected with N.ceranae only. When combined with Nosema, thiamethoxam caused a significant reduction in survival from the control, but this reduction is not significantly different from N. ceranae alone. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused significantly increased expressions compared to the control for the genes of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptacin, but significantly decreased expression for the defensin gene. When the two factors were combined, the expression patterns were similar to N.ceranae infection alone (apidaecin, defencin and hymenoptaecin), except abaecin, which was increased compared to Nosema infected bees. For detoxification genesCCE8 and CYP315A1, thiamethoxam caused significantly increased gene expression but Nosema caused significantly decreased expression. When combined, the two factors did not show a further increase in Mortality compared to Nosema infection alone.

In the present study, the sublethal effects of a sulfoxaflor commercial product, Isoclast™ Active, were evaluated in the laboratory using larvae and newly emerged worker honeybees. The results of 96-h acute toxicity showed that Isoclast is moderately toxic to adult bees, and it could induce significant death and growth failure of larvae after continuous dietary intake. In addition, Isoclast induced significant changes in antioxidative (SOD, CAT), lipid peroxidation (POD, LPO, MDA), detoxification (GST, GR, GSH) and signal transduction-related (AChE, ACh) enzymes or products both in larvae and adult honey bees under residue levels.

Newly emerged bees from colonies, non-treated or treated with thiamethoxam, were organized in six groups and kept in cages. Thiamethoxam treated bees were further exposed to either thiamethoxam or Nosema (groups TT and TN), or simultaneously to both (group TTN).

Results showed that gene expression patterns changed with time and depended on the treatment. In group TC at the time of emergence the majority of tested genes were downregulated, among which nine were significantly altered. The same gene pattern was observed on day six, where the only significantly upregulated gene was defensin-1.

This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated.

236,JOUR,Correlation Between Increased Homing Flight Duration and Altered Gene Expression in the Brain of Honey Bee Foragers After Acute Oral Exposure to Thiacloprid and Thiamethoxam,"['Christen, V.', 'Grossar, D.', 'Charrière, J.-D.', 'Eyer, M.', 'Jeker, L.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Neonicotinoids as thiamethoxam and thiacloprid are suspected to be implicated in the decline of honey bee populations. As nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling in insects, leading to neurotoxicity and are therefore globally used as insecticides. Several behavioral studies have shown links between neonicotinoid exposure of bees and adverse effects on foraging activity, homing flight performance and reproduction, but the molecular aspects underlying these effects are not well-understood. In the last years, several studies through us and others showed the effects of exposure to neonicotinoids on gene expression in the brain of honey bees. Transcripts of acetylcholine receptors, hormonal regulation, stress markers, detoxification enzymes, immune system related genes and transcripts of the energy metabolism were altered after neonicotinoid exposure. To elucidate the link between homing flight performance and shifts in gene expression in the brain of honey bees after neonicotinoid exposure, we combined homing flight activity experiments applying RFID technology and gene expression analysis. We analyzed the expression of endocrine factors, stress genes, detoxification enzymes and genes linked to energy metabolism in forager bees after homing flight experiments. Three different experiments (experiment I: pilot study; experiment II: “worst-case” study and experiment III: laboratory study) were performed. In a pilot study, we wanted to investigate if we could see differences in gene expression between controls and exposed bees (experiment I). This first study was followed by a so-called “worst-case” study (experiment II), where we investigated mainly differences in the expression of transcripts linked to energy metabolism between fast and slow returning foragers. We found a correlation between homing flight duration and the expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, one transcript linked to oxidative phosphorylation. In the third experiment (experiment III), foragers were exposed in the laboratory to 1 ng/bee thiamethoxam and 8 ng/bee thiacloprid followed by gene expression analysis without a subsequent flight experiment. We could partially confirm the induction of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 5A, which we detected in experiment II. In addition, we analyzed the effect of the feeding mode (group feeding vs. single bee feeding) on data scattering and demonstrated that single bee feeding is superior to group feeding as it significantly reduces variability in gene expression. Based on the data, we thus hypothesize that the disruption of energy metabolism may be one reason for a prolongation of homing flight duration in neonicotinoid treated bees.

At present, little is known about how honey bees respond to pesticide stresses during the continuous development period. This study aims to examine effects of long-term acetamiprid exposure on the development and survival of honey bees, and further present the expression profile in larvae, 1-day-old, and 7-day-old adult worker bees that related to immune, detoxification, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and memory. Honey bees from 2-day-old larvae to 14-day-old adults except the pupal stage were continuously fed with different acetamiprid solutions (0, 5, and 25 mg/L). We found that acetamiprid over 5 mg/L disturbed the development involving birth weight and emergence rate of newly emerged bees, and reduced the proportion of capped cells of larvae at 25 mg/L; gene expression related to immune and detoxification of worker bees exposed to acetamiprid was roughly activated, returned and then inhibited from larval to emerged and to the late adult stage, respectively. Moreover, lifespans of bees treated with acetamiprid at 25 mg/L were significantly reduced.

Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field. © 2017 De Smet et al.

The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/μl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.001,156,,36,43,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061441396&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=27060647642889ad6ee1c69f9f3627d9,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,15

Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3′(2′), 5′-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq.

Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up-and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees.

The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. © 2022 Kim et al.

We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana.

The extensive use of neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid, as agricultural pesticides, leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in bees, pollen, nectar, and honey, thereby inducing deleterious effects. Forager honey bees face significant exposure to pesticide residues while searching for resources outside the hive, particularly systemic pesticides like imidacloprid. In this study, 360 Apis mellifera bees, twenty-one days old (supposed to be in the forager phase) previously marked were fed syrup (honey and water, 1:1 m/v) containing a lethal dose (0.081 μg/bee) or sublethal dose (0.00081 μg/bee) of imidacloprid. The syrup was provided in plastic troughs, with 250 μL added per trough onto each plastic Petri dish containing 5 bees (50 μL per bee). The bees were kept in the plastic Petri dishes inside an incubator, and after 1 and 4 h of ingestion, the bees were euthanised and stored in an ultra-freezer (−80 °C) for transcriptome analysis. Following the 1-h ingestion of imidacloprid, 1516 genes (73 from lethal dose; 1509 from sublethal dose) showed differential expression compared to the control, while after 4 h, 758 genes (733 from lethal dose; 25 from sublethal) exhibited differential expression compared to the control. All differentially expressed genes found in the brain tissue transcripts of forager bees were categorised based on gene ontology into functional groups encompassing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. These analyses revealed that sublethal doses might be capable of altering more genes than lethal doses, potentially associated with a phenomenon known as insecticide-induced hormesis. Alterations in genes related to areas such as the immune system, nutritional metabolism, detoxification system, circadian rhythm, odour detection, foraging activity, and memory in bees were present after exposure to the pesticide. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of both lethal and sublethal doses of imidacloprid, thereby providing valuable insights for establishing public policies regarding the use of neonicotinoids, which are directly implicated in the compromised health of Apis mellifera bees. © 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173393,940,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195060066&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.173393&partnerID=40&md5=d3c9ad12954c60ff9587c3c21a2f36a5,Scopus,"['agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'apiculture', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Beekeeping', 'Bees', 'beta galactosidase', 'circadian rhythm', 'climate change', 'Climate change', 'deformity', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'false discovery rate', 'Food products', 'galactosidase', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene Expression', 'gene ontology', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genes expression', 'honey', 'honeybee', 'Hormesis', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'immune system', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide-induced hormesis', 'Insecticides', 'lethal dose', 'Lethal dose', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'parasite', 'peptide synthesis', 'Pesticide', 'Petri dish', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population', 'Population statistics', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'ribosome', 'RNA binding', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'temperature', 'vulnerability']",,,,0,,1,21

Previous studies have indicated that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impair learning, memory capacity, foraging, and immunocompetence in honey bees (Apis mellifera, Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Despite these, few studies have been carried out on the molecular effects of neonicotinoids. In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and drug metabolism.

With the advancement of agricultural modernisation, the large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides is one of the main factors leading to the decline of bees. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. Acute (48 h) oral toxicity tests showed that a 5% lethal concentration (LC5 ) was 0.220 mg/L, and a 20% lethal concentration (LC20 ) was 0.458 mg/L. The gene expression profile shows that when compared with the control group, the LC5 group induced 206 significantly upregulated, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 363 significantly downregulated DEGs, while the LC20 group induced 180 significantly upregulated DEGs and 419 significantly downregulated DEGs. Significantly, transcriptomic analysis revealed DEGs involved in immunity, detoxification, and the nervous system, such as antimicrobial peptides, vitellogenin, synaptotagmin-10, AChE-2, and nAChRa9. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. Collectively, our findings will help clarify the deleterious physiological and behavioural impacts of dinotefuran on bees and provide a basis for future research on the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. © 2021 by the authors.

Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0 ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects. We found 678 genes differentially expressed under both imidacloprid exposures relative to controls, including mitochondrial activity, development, and DNA replication genes. However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure; uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results. A smaller differentially expressed set only in lower concentration larvae, included neural development and cell growth genes. Our findings show varying molecular consequences under different field-realistic neonicotinoid concentrations, and that even low concentrations may affect fundamental biological processes. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023///,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-36232-y,13,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163073015&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-36232-y&partnerID=40&md5=f5069c8d635fec9783e72eda798cf54e,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'larva', 'Larva', 'gene expression', 'genetics', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'Gene Expression']",,,,0,,1,24

The molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we measured the response of juvenile hormone (JH) to environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), monitored the dynamic changes in the transcription of genes encoding major JH metabolic enzymes (CYP15A1, FAMET, JHAMT and JHE) using RT-qPCR, and analysed the transcriptome changes in worker larvae under thiamethoxam stress using RNA-seq. Thiamethoxam significantly increased the levels of JH3 in honey bee larvae, but no significant changes in the transcript levels of the four major metabolic enzymes were observed. Thiamethoxam exposure resulted in 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). P450 CYP6AS5 was upregulated, and some ion-related, odourant-related and gustatory receptors for sugar taste genes were altered significantly. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption were influenced by thiamethoxam. These changes may do harm to honey bee caste differentiation, foraging behaviour related to sensory perception and nutrient levels of bee colonies.

However, its molecular effects are poorly known. Here, we report the global gene expression profile in the brain of honey bee foragers assessed by RNA-sequencing. Bees were exposed for 72 h to nominal concentrations of 25 and 250 ng/bee via sucrose solution. Determined residue concentrations by LC-MS/MS were 0.59 and 5.49 ng/bee, respectively. Thiacloprid exposure led to 5 and 71 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as metabolism enzymes and transporters were altered at 5.49 ng/bee. Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that mitochondrial ribosome proteins, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and additional metabolic pathways were altered. Among 21 genes assessed by RT-qPCR, the transcript of farnesol dehydrogenase involved in juvenile hormone III synthesis was significantly down-regulated. Transcripts of cyp6a14-like and apolipophorin-II like protein, cytochrome oxidase (cox17) and the non-coding RNA (LOC102654625) were significantly up-regulated at 5.49 ng/bee. Our findings indicate that thiacloprid causes transcriptional changes of genes prominently associated with mitochondria, particularly oxidative phosphorylation.

462,JOUR,Molecular Effects of Neonicotinoids in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Mittner, F.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"Neonicotinoids are implicated in the decline of bee populations. As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α 1 and α 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy.

Such new, anthropogenic stressors include the neonicotinoid class of crop-protecting agents, which have been implicated in the population declines of pollinating insects, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 mu g/L-1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program.

451,JOUR,Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Bachofer, S.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Pollution,"Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72 h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well.

Here, we investigated effects of acetamiprid, Varroa destructor, and Nosema ceranae, which act either alone or in combination. Our results suggested that interaction between the three factors was additive, with survival risk increasing as the number of stressors increased. Although exposure to 150 μg/L acetamiprid alone did not negatively impact honey bee survival, it caused severe damage to midgut tissue. Among the three stressors, V. destructor posed the greatest threat to honey bee survival, and N. ceranae exacerbated intestinal damage and increased thickness of the midgut wall. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that different combinations of stressors elicited specific gene expression responses in honey bees, and genes involved in energy metabolism, immunity, and detoxification were altered in response to multiple stressor combinations. Additionally, genes associated with Toll and Imd signalling, tyrosine metabolism, and phototransduction pathway were significantly suppressed in response to different combinations of multiple stressors. This study enhances our understanding of the adaptation mechanisms to multiple stressors and aids in development of suitable protective measures for honey bees.

Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations.

To test the effect of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on the lifespan and health of honey bees, workers were orally and topically exposed to LD5 doses of these insecticides. The survivorship of treated bees was monitored and the expression of three immune-related genes, hymenoptaecin (AmHym), basket (AmBask) and lysozyme (AmLyso2) was analyzed at 24 and 72 hours post treatment (hpt), as well as that of the antioxidant-related gene vitellogenin (AmVit2), the poly-U binding factor (AmPuf68), and the detoxification gene cytochrome P450 (AmCYP9Q3). The three insecticides significantly reduced the length of life of bees but the mode of application did not affect survivorship. AmHym, AmBask and AmVit2 expression was significantly down-regulated at 72 hpt in bees treated with clothianidin and imidacloprid, indicating immunosuppression. However, AmLyso2, AmCYP9Q3 and AmPuf68 were significantly up-regulated. The down-regulation of AmVit2 could have caused decreased resistance to oxidative stress. AmPuf68 expression could be associated with increased protection against xenobionts. AmCYP9Q3 was up-regulated at 24 and 72 hpt in oral exposures, but only until 72 hpt in topical exposures, indicating faster sensitivity towards detoxification mechanisms in oral treatments.

Although the cause of CCD is multifactorial, pesticide is a major factor that leads to colony collapse. At sublethal doses, pesticide is known to negatively affect honeybee physiological development and behaviour. Previously, we found the insecticides imidacloprid and deltamethrin significantly reduced honeybee dancing and foraging efficiency. In our experiments, the duration of honeybee imbibing food at the feeder declined and the returning period from the feeder to the hive increased in both insecticide groups compared with the control group. As a follow-up, we performed a deep RNA-seq analysis to reveal the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this altered foraging performance. Genes involved in detoxification were upregulated in both the imidacloprid and the deltamethrin-treatment groups. Gene members in immune pathways, odorant receptors and major royal jelly protein families were significantly downregulated in the treatment groups compared with the controls. This fluctuating gene expression profile shows that multifaceted aspects of honeybee physiology were affected by the two insecticides, which may lead to inaccurate communication and impaired learning and memory.

219,JOUR,Responses of honey bees to lethal and sublethal doses of formulated clothianidin alone and mixtures,"['Yao, J.', 'Zhu, Y.C.', 'Adamczyk, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has sparked concern over the toxicity risk to honey bees (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + λ -cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%. The LC 50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient, which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee (LD 50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 μl per bee per day. In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC 50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville (MS, United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations, clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2018.",2018///,2018,10.1093/jee/toy140,111,4,1517,1525,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053733948&doi=10.1093%2fjee%2ftoy140&partnerID=40&md5=35bbee65087b34aab15e9e1271c6097a,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,35

Previous studies have demonstrated that the neonicotinoid thiacloprid has adverse effects on foraging and memory behaviors. However, there is no direct evidence linking thiacloprid-induced neuronal cell damage in the brains of honeybees to learning and memory dysfunction. Adult honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers were chronically exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid. We discovered that thiacloprid negatively affected their survival, food consumption, and body weight. In addition, sucrose sensitivity and memory performance were impaired. We evaluated the apoptosis of honeybee brain cells using TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) and Caspase-3 assays, which revealed that thiacloprid increases the dose-dependent apoptosis of neurons in the mushroom bodies (MB) and antennal lobes (AL). We also determined the abnormal transcripts of multiple genes, including vitellogenin (Vg), immune system genes (apidaecin and catalase), and memory-associated genes (pka, creb, Nmdar1, Dop2, Oa1, Oa-2R, and Oa-3R).

Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially ""bee-safe"" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees.",2021/04//,2021,10.3390/insects12040357,12,4,,,,,,2075-4450,WOS:000643078900001,,0,,1,37
662,JOUR,Melatonin enhances the antioxidant capacity to rescue the honey bee Apis mellifera from the ecotoxicological effects caused by environmental imidacloprid,"['Li, Z.', 'Duan, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Qin, Q.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees.

549,JOUR,Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees,"['Tsvetkov, N.', 'Zayed, A.']",Ecology and Evolution,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a “streetlight effect” where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways; foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. © 2021 The Authors.

589,JOUR,Induced thiacloprid insensitivity in honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is associated with up-regulation of detoxification genes,"['Alptekin, S.', 'Bass, C.', 'Nicholls, C.', 'Paine, M.J.', 'Clark, S.J.', 'Field, L.', 'Moores, G.D.']",Insect molecular biology,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera, are markedly less sensitive to neonicotinoid insecticides containing a cyanoimino pharmacophore than to those with a nitroimino group. Although previous work has suggested that this results from enhanced metabolism of the former by detoxification enzymes, the specific enzyme(s) involved remain to be characterized. In this work, a pretreatment of honey bees with a sublethal dose of thiacloprid resulted in induced insensitivity to the same compound immediately following thiacloprid feeding. A longer pretreatment time resulted in no, or increased, sensitivity. Transcriptome profiling, using microarrays, identified a number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes that were over-expressed significantly in insecticide-treated bees compared with untreated controls. These included five P450s, CYP6BE1, CYP305D1, CYP6AS5, CYP315A1, CYP301A1, and a carboxyl/cholinesterase (CCE) CCE8.

297,JOUR,Sperm viability and gene expression in honey bee queens (Apis mellifera) following exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos,"['Chaimanee, V.', 'Evans, J.D.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Jackson, C.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"Honey bee population declines are of global concern. Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.03.004,89,,1,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960857417&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2016.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=33b4203b1a0bd361e5b24a1bfbf0fc22,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,41

Here we report our recent investigation on how imidacloprid, one of the major neonicotinoids, affects worker bees by profiling the transcriptomes of various ages of bees exposed to different doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage. The results show that imidacloprid treatments during the larval stage severely altered the gene expression profiles and may induce precocious foraging. Differential expression of foraging regulators was found in 14-day-old treated adults. A high transcriptome similarity between larvae-treated 14-day-old adults and 20-day-old controls was also observed, and the similarity was positively correlated with the dose of imidacloprid. One parts per billion (ppb) of imidacloprid was sufficient to generate a long-term impact on the bee’s gene expression as severe as with 50 ppb imidacloprid.

In addition, the distribution of proteins involved in important biological processes in the brain were evaluated on the 1st day of exposure by MALDI-imaging analysis. Bioassays were performed to determine the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid to bees, and the value obtained was 1.4651 ng imidacloprid/mu L diet. Based on this result, the sublethal concentration to be administered at 1, 4 and 8 days was established as a hundredth (1/100) of the LC50. The results obtained from the ultrastructural analysis showed alterations in the midgut cells of bees as nuclear and mitochondrial damage and an increase of vacuoles. The insecticide caused spacing among the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies, chromatin condensation and loss of mitochondrial cristae.

Another important cause of mass bee colonies losses is the use of pesticides. Therefore, the goal of this study was to verify the influence of polyphenols on longevity, food consumption, and cytochrome P450 gene expression in worker bees intoxicated by thiacloprid. The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. © 2021 by the authors.

65,JOUR,One size does not fit all: Caste and sex differences in the response of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to chronic oral neonicotinoid exposure,"['Mobley, MW', 'Gegear, RJ']",PLOS ONE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in the rapid global decline of bumblebees over recent years, particularly in agricultural and urban areas. While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.",2018/10/08/,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0200041,13,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000446632700003,,0,,1,47

In this context, the A. mellifera foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100: 0,0227 ng de thiamethoxam/μL−1 diet), a neurotoxic insecticide, for 8 days; and it was decided to investigate the insecticide effect on the brain by a shotgun proteomic approach followed by label-free quantitative-based proteomics. A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism.

Furthermore, we collected honey bees exposed to the clothianidin and analyzed their stress-related gene expression. The results showed that the foraging behavior of honey bee colonies located near rice cultivation areas did not exhibit significant differences between the treatment sites (Cheongyang and Gimje) and the control site (Wanju) during the experimental period. However, it was observed that the expression levels of stress-related genes in honey bees collected from the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control.

Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (γ-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism.

This is critical for understanding their responses to, and defenses against, a variety of environmental stresses, including agrochemicals. Therefore, we studied the detoxification and immune responses of a stingless bee, Nanotrigona perilampoides, which is an important stingless bee that is widely distributed throughout Mexico, including urban areas, and has the potential to be used in commercial pollination. We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days.

370,JOUR,Effect of age on insecticide susceptibility and enzymatic activities of three detoxification enzymes and one invertase in honey bee workers (Apis mellifera),"['Zhu, Y.C.', 'Caren, J.', 'Reddy, G.V.P.', 'Li, W.', 'Yao, J.']",Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part - C: Toxicology and Pharmacology,"Honey bee is an economically important insect for honey production and pollination. Frequent exposure to toxic pesticides is one of the major risk factors causing the pollinator population decline. However, age effects of honey bees on pesticide susceptibility have been largely ignored and many researchers use bees of unknown age for assessing the risk of pesticides. Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. © 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108844,238,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089262289&doi=10.1016%2fj.cbpc.2020.108844&partnerID=40&md5=01cf9a35d7021a7a9303c0b2f05f247f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'cyhalothrin', 'nonhuman', 'pyrethroid', 'Apis mellifera', 'mortality', 'priority journal', 'metabolism', 'cytochrome P450', 'insecticide resistance', 'enzyme activity', 'organophosphate insecticide', 'carbamic acid derivative', 'age', 'oxamyl', 'esterase', 'Esterases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'drug sensitivity', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'aging', 'Aging', 'enzymology', 'acephate', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Invertase', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'Detoxification enzymes', 'Age', 'Age Factors', 'beta fructofuranosidase', 'beta-Fructofuranosidase', 'Soluble protein', 'Worker']",,,,0,,1,57

It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L−1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L−1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees.

However, traditional environmental risk assessment is only carried out based on ecotoxicological data of single substances. In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L−1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L−1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators.

Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/μL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees.

520,JOUR,Pesticide risk assessment at the molecular level using honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes: A complementary approach,"['Haas, J.', 'Nauen, R.']",Environment International,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) first-tier pesticide risk assessment is largely based on standardized laboratory toxicity bioassays after both acute and chronic exposure. Recent research on honey bee cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) uncovered CYP9Q3 as the molecular determinant mediating neonicotinoid insecticide selectivity and explaining why certain neonicotinoids such as thiacloprid show > 1000-fold lower acute toxicity than others (e.g. imidacloprid). Here this knowledge is leveraged for mechanistic risk assessment at the molecular level using a fluorescence-based high-throughput in vitro assay, predicting the interaction of diverse pesticidal chemotypes, including azole fungicides, with recombinantly expressed honey bee CYP9Q enzymes, known to metabolize thiacloprid, acetamiprid and tau-fluvalinate. Some azole fungicides were shown to be synergistic in combination with certain insecticides, including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, whereas others such as prothioconazole were not. We demonstrate that biochemical CYP9Q2/CYP9Q3 inhibition data of azoles revealed a striking correlation with their synergistic potential at the organismal level, and even allow to explain combined toxicity effects observed for tank mixtures under field conditions. Our novel toxicogenomics-based approach is designed to complement existing methods for pesticide risk assessment with unprecedented screening capacity, by utilizing honey bee P450 enzymes known to confer pesticide selectivity, in order to biochemically address issues of ecotoxicological concern. © 2020 The Author(s)",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envint.2020.106372,147,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099051848&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2020.106372&partnerID=40&md5=77dc0558ca8e230c990713233c55fa45,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pyrethroid', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'adult', 'thiamethoxam', 'acute toxicity', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'priority journal', 'Toxicity', 'thiacloprid', 'Risk Assessment', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'experimental study', 'in vitro study', 'fungicide', 'genetics', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'Fungicides', 'mortality rate', 'ecotoxicity', 'triazole derivative', 'enzyme activity', 'Synergism', 'physiological response', 'fluvalinate', 'binding site', 'correlation analysis', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'in vivo study', 'epoxiconazole', 'molecular analysis', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Enzymes', 'IC50', 'genomics', 'enzyme inhibition', 'process optimization', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Combined toxicity', 'triadimefon', '7 benzyloxy 4 trifluoromethyleoumarin', 'arylation', 'cytochrome P450 9Q2', 'cytochrome P450 9Q3', 'Cytochrome p450 enzymes', 'Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'edetic acid', 'enzyme binding', 'fluorescence analysis', 'Knowledge management', 'Michaelis Menten kinetics', 'Molecular determinants', 'Molecular ecotoxicology', 'molecular size', 'Pollinator safety', 'Recent researches', 'Screening capacity', 'triflumizole', 'uniconazole']",,,,0,,1,61

After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively). The responses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaEs-1-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP. Thus, this set of honeybee biomarkers appears to be a promising tool to evaluate environmental and honeybee health, and it could generate fingerprints to characterize exposures to pesticides.

Despite this, even just a limited number of studies have addressed its residue-level effects on the physiological and immunological biomarkers of foraging honey bees in semi-field conditions. In the present study, we determined the LT50 of sulfoxaflor (Closer™ 24% SC) on forager bees in the laboratory at concentrations that were 12 to 300,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration. Following that, we exposed bee colonies in a semi-field in-hive experiment for 21 days to a concentration that is 600,000-fold lower than the field-recommended concentration to assess potential effects on the physiological state of honey bee foragers. To do that, a total of six colonies were treated with Closer™ (0.3 µg a.i./L) or control treatment, and the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glucose oxidase (GOX), and carboxylesterase (CaEs) in head tissues and invertase (IV), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the midgut tissues of forager bees were assessed at 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-day post-exposure.

However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/μL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen. GST activity showed differences in the abdomen after one and five days of thiamethoxam exposure. These findings suggests that the abdomen is more affected than the head after oral exposure to thiamethoxam.

Foraging bees were exposed to different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0.01-, 0.02-, 0.04-, 0.1-, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24 h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance. The results indicated that regardless of how the bees were exposed to insecticides, dinotefuran was extremely toxic to adult A. mellifera (topical LD50 = 0.0006 μg/bee and oral feeding LC50 = 1.29 mg/L). Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to dinotefuran at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and pymetrozine were relatively less toxic to bees (<25 % mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera. The biochemical analysis of carboxylesterase and GST showed that these enzymes detoxified the low doses of acetamiprid, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl, but not dinotefuran. Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals. © 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",2015///,2015,10.1007/s13592-014-0315-0,46,2,177,193,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924804372&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-014-0315-0&partnerID=40&md5=b92a75225834cd31b12b51adcbd27850,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,67

Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony.

For example, bees visiting a flowering crop may be chronically exposed to low concentrations of systemic insecticides applied before bloom and then to a pulse of fungicide, considered safe for bees, applied during bloom. In this study, we simulate this scenario under laboratory conditions with females of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis L. We studied the effects of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid insecticide, Confidor® (imidacloprid) at a realistic concentration, and of a pulse (1 day) exposure of the fungicide Folicur® SE (tebuconazole) at field application rate. Syrup consumption, survival, and four biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase (CaE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were evaluated at two different time points. An integrated biological response (IBRv2) index was elaborated with the biomarker results. The fungicide pulse had no impact on survival but temporarily reduced syrup consumption and increased the IBRv2 index, indicating potential molecular alterations. The neonicotinoid significantly reduced syrup consumption, survival, and the neurological activity of the enzymes. The co-exposure neonicotinoid-fungicide did not increase toxicity at the tested concentrations.

In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE.

However, flupyradifurone was shown in acute toxicity tests to be several orders of magnitude less toxic to western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) than many other insecticides targeting insect nAChRs. The underlying reasons for this difference in toxicity remains unknown and were investigated here. Pharmacokinetic studies after contact application of [14C]flupyradifurone to honey bees revealed slow uptake, with internalized compound degraded into a few metabolites that are all practically non-toxic to honey bees in both oral and contact bioassays. Furthermore, receptor binding studies revealed a lack of high-affinity binding of these metabolites to honey bee nAChRs. Screening of a library of 27 heterologously expressed honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of flupyradifurone: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3. Transgenic Drosophila lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less susceptible to flupyradifurone when compared to control flies, confirming the importance of these P450s for flupyradifurone metabolism in honey bees. Biochemical assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BOMFC) indicated a weak, non-competitive inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by flupyradifurone. In contrast, the azole fungicides prochloraz and propiconazole were strong nanomolar inhibitors of these flupyradifurone metabolizing P450s, explaining their highly synergistic effects in combination with flupyradifurone as demonstrated in acute laboratory contact toxicity tests of adult bees. Interestingly, the azole fungicide prothioconazole is only slightly synergistic in combination with flupyradifurone – an observation supported by molecular P450 inhibition assays. Such molecular assays have value in the prediction of potential risks posed to bees by flupyradifurone mixture partners under applied conditions. Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of the identified P450 genes in all honey bee life-stages, with highest expression levels observed in late larvae and adults, suggesting honey bees have the capacity to metabolize flupyradifurone across all life-stages. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the low intrinsic toxicity of flupyradifurone to honey bees and offer a new, more holistic approach to support bee pollinator risk assessment by molecular means. © 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112247,217,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104682585&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112247&partnerID=40&md5=f354e85b43a93450221db965c545b476,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pest control', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'adult', 'toxicity testing', 'Drosophila', 'gene expression', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'Pollinators', 'animal tissue', 'in vitro study', 'metabolism', 'fungicide', 'bioassay', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'metabolite', '4-Butyrolactone', 'flupyradifurone', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'butenolide', 'synergism', 'propiconazole', 'triazole derivative', 'Triazoles', 'Synergism', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'binding affinity', 'safety', 'toxicity test', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'biochemical analysis', 'scanning electron microscopy', 'gene expression regulation', 'aerobic metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome', 'tissue distribution', 'carbon 14', 'gene identification', 'validation study', 'toxicogenomics', 'enzyme structure', 'contact bioassay', 'oral bioassay', 'P450', 'cytochrome P6AQ1', 'cytochrome P9Q2', 'cytochrome P9Q3', 'enzyme kinetics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'receptor binding', 'toxicogenetics', 'Toxicogenetics']",,,,0,,1,77

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees.

Despite many studies have revealed that honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae are posting a high risk on exposure to pesticides, but the toxicology information of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid on bee larvae remain limited. Results: The no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid for honey bee larvae were 4 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively. Except for CarE, the enzymic activities of GST and P450 were not influenced by chlorothalonil at NOAEC, while chronic exposure to acetamiprid slightly increased the activities of the three tested enzymes at NOAEC. Further, the exposed larvae showed significantly higher expression of genes involved in a series of different toxicologically relevant process following, including caste development (Tor (GB44905), InR-2 (GB55425), Hr4 (GB47037), Ac3 (GB11637) and ILP-2 (GB10174)), immune system response (abaecin (GB18323), defensin-1 (GB19392), toll-X4 (GB50418)), and oxidative stress response (P450, GSH, GST, CarE). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the exposure to chlorothalonil and acetamiprid, even at concentrations below the NOAEC, showed potentially effects on bee larvae’s fitness, and more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect larvae fitness should be explored in the further.

They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that regulation of honey bee P450s is tuned to chemicals occurring naturally in the hive environment and that, in terms of toxicological capacity, a diet of sugar is not equivalent to a diet of honey.",2012/02/03/,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0031051,7,2,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000302178400026,,0,,1,80

Pesticides enter the hive through contaminated nectar and pollen carried by returning forager honey bees or placed in the hive by beekeepers when managing hive pests. We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss. Additionally, pesticide exposure altered gene expression of detoxification enzymes. However, the tested exposure scenario is unlikely to be representative of real-world conditions but emphasizes the importance of proper hive management to minimize pesticide contamination of the hive environment or simulates a future scenario of increased contamination. © 2019; The chronic larval exposure to different pesticides affect the survival and health of immature and potentially newly emerged adult honey bees. © 2019",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113420,256,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076237910&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2019.113420&partnerID=40&md5=be410da64ffc9a42e16734b02679e011,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,81

In the agricultural environment, A. cerana may be exposed to acetamiprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) and difenoconazole (triazole fungicide), alone or in combination because they are commonly applied to various crops. At present, our understanding of the toxicological effects of acetamiprid and difenoconazole on honey bee gut microbiomes is limited. The primary objective of this study was to explore whether these two pesticides affect honey bees’ gut microbiota and to analyze the transcriptional effects of these two pesticides on honey bees’ head and gut. In this study, adults of A. cerana were exposed to acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole by contaminated syrup at field-realistic concentrations for 10 days. Results indicated that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole chronic exposure did not affect honey bees’ survival and food consumption, whereas difenoconazole decreased the weight of honey bees. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that difenoconazole and the mixture of difenoconazole and acetamiprid decreased the diversity index and shaped the composition of gut bacteria microbiota, whereas acetamiprid did not impact the gut bacterial community. The ITS sequence data showed that neither of the two pesticides affected the fungal community structure. Meanwhile, we also observed that acetamiprid or difenoconazole significantly altered the expression of genes related to detoxification and immunity in honey bees’ tissues. Furthermore, we observed that the adverse effect of the acetamiprid and difenoconazole mixture on honey bees’ health was greater than that of a single mixture.

However, the contribution of the honey bee gut microbiota to host detoxification ability has yet to be investigated. In order to address this question, we compared the expression of cytochrome P450s (P450s) genes between gut microbiota deficient (GD) workers and conventional gut community (CV) workers and compared the mortality rates and the pesticide residue levels of GD and CV workers treated with thiacloprid or tau-fluvalinate. Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees. Taken together, our results demonstrated that honey bee gut symbiont could contribute to bee health through the modification of the host xenobiotics detoxification pathways and revealed a potential negative impact of antibiotics to honey bee detoxification ability and health. © 2020 The Authors.

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2–5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health. N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid insecticides are much less toxic to honeybees and bumble bees than N-nitroguanidine compounds.

For example, recent work has shown that cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this, exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration. Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. © 2019 Beadle et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2019///,2019,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007903,15,2,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061562980&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1007903&partnerID=40&md5=2e2bbb319513299a2211bd88ed4c830a,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,85

However, the validity of using A. mellifera as a surrogate for other Apis and non-Apis bees in pesticide risk assessment has been questioned. Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear. Here we used a phylogenomic approach to identify > 100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families. Functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species revealed that P450-mediated detoxification of certain systemic insecticides, including the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the butenolide flupyradifurone, is conserved across all major bee pollinator families. However, our analyses also reveal that CYP9Q-related genes are not universal to all bee species, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes. Thus, our results reveal an evolutionary conserved capacity to metabolize certain insecticides across all major bee families while identifying a small number of bee species where this function may have been lost.

A previous study revealed that this is due to enhanced oxidative metabolism of FPF, mediated by three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), including CYP6AQ1. Therefore, we followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in FPF metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis on four stingless bee species, including Frieseomelitta varia, Heterotrigona itama, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonula carbonaria to identify CYP6AQ1-like functional orthologs. Three non-Meliponini, but tropical bee species, i.e., Ammobates syriacus, Euglossa dilemma and Megalopta genalis were analyzed as well. We identified candidate P450s in all (neo)tropical species with greater than 61% and 67% predicted protein sequence identities when compared to A. mellifera CYP6AQ1 and Bombus terrestris CYP6AQ26, respectively. Heterologous expression in High Five insect cells of these functional orthologs revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a preference for the O-debenzylation of bulkier substrates. Competition assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BOMFC) with these enzymes indicated inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by increasing concentrations of FPF. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/ MS analysis revealed the capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolize FPF by hydroxylation in vitro at various levels, indicating a conserved FPF detoxification potential in different (neo)tropical bee species including Meliponini.

Although most neonicotinoids are highly toxic to bees, some of them are relatively safe. To explore the molecular mechanism of these differences in toxicity, homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the interactions between Apis mellifera (α8)2(β1)3 nAChR and high bee-toxic neonicotinoid (imidacloprid, IMI), medium bee-toxic (thiacloprid, THI) and low bee-toxic butenolides (flupyradifurone, FPF). It was observed that three major interactions were similar across all systems, including water-bridge networks, π-π interactions and the polar interactions between the electron-withdrawing pharmacophores and the receptor. The calculated binding free energy was similar between IMI and THI. While FPF was the lowest bee-toxic, it displayed the strongest binding free energy value, the additional C–H⋯O H-bonds with Arg80 and Trp179 were the main reason. The bee toxicities of neonicotinoids and other nAChR modulators are not only determined by receptor affinities, but also by other factors (for example physicochemical properties and metabolic detoxification).

Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. © 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

514,JOUR,Physiological responses of the stingless bee Partamona helleri to oral exposure to three agrochemicals: impact on antioxidant enzymes and hemocyte count,"['Botina, L.L.', 'Barbosa, W.F.', 'Viana, T.A.', 'de Oliveira Faustino, A.', 'Martins, G.F.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Agrochemicals pose significant threats to the survival of bees, yet the physiological impacts of sublethal doses on stingless bees remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to three commercial formulations of agrochemicals [CuSO4 (leaf fertilizer), glyphosate (herbicide), and spinosad (bioinsecticide)] on antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde content (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and total hemocyte count (THC) in the stingless bee Partamona helleri. Foragers were exposed to lethal concentrations aimed to kill 5% (LC5) of CuSO4 (120 μg mL−1) or spinosad (0.85 μg mL−1) over a 24-h period. Glyphosate-exposed bees received the recommended label concentration (7400 μg mL−1), as they exhibited 100% survival after exposure. Ingestion of CuSO4 or glyphosate-treated diets by bees was reduced. Levels of NO and catalase (CAT) remained unaffected at 0 h or 24 h post-exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher at 0 h compared to 24 h, although insignificantly so when compared to the control. Exposure to CuSO4 reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity at 0 h but increased it after 24 h, for both CuSO4 and glyphosate. MDA levels decreased after 0 h exposure to CuSO4 or spinosad but increased after 24 h exposure to all tested agrochemicals. THC showed no difference among glyphosate or spinosad compared to the control or across time. However, CuSO4 exposure significantly increased THC. These findings shed light on the physiological responses of stingless bees to agrochemicals, crucial for understanding their overall health. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34790-w,31,42,54648,54658,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202610317&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-34790-w&partnerID=40&md5=b8e841d5900007b3da045b2bfa1ae36b,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'Sublethal effects', 'survival', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'catalase', 'Glyphosates', 'Weed control', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'Physiological models', 'Physiological response', 'metabolism', 'spinosad', 'biopesticide', 'immunity', 'physiological response', 'Oral exposure', 'blood cell', 'Hemocytes', 'Bioinsecticide', 'Herbicide', 'antioxidant', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Enzymes', 'Oxidative stress', 'Fertilizers', 'Antioxidants', 'Antioxidants enzymes', 'Bioinsecticides', 'Catalase', 'Cellular immunity', 'Cellulars', 'Leaf fertilizer', 'nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Total hemocyte counts']",,,,0,,1,90

Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system. These data support the hypothesis that the combination of the increasing prevalence of N. ceranae with high pesticide content in beehives may contribute to colony depopulation.",2011/06/28/,2011,10.1371/journal.pone.0021550,6,6,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000292142800039,,0,,1,91

Altered composition and lowered diversity of pollen nutrition may reinforce negative pesticide impacts on bees. Here we investigated the development and survival of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis provisioned with three different pollen types, as well as a mixture of these types representing a higher pollen diversity. We exposed bees of each nutritional treatment to five pesticides at different concentrations in the laboratory. Two field-realistic concentrations of three nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) modulating insecticides (thiacloprid, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone), as well as of two fungicides (azoxystrobin and tebuconazole) were examined. We further measured the expression of two detoxification genes (CYP9BU1, CYP9BU2) under exposure to thiacloprid across different nutrition treatments as a potential mechanistic pathway driving pesticide-nutrition interactions. We found that more diverse pollen nutrition reduced development time, enhanced pollen efficacy (cocoon weight divided by consumed pollen weight) and pollen consumption, and increased weight of O. bicornis after larval development (cocoon weight). Contrary to fungicides, high field-realistic concentrations of all three insecticides negatively affected O. bicornis by extending development times. Moreover, sulfoxaflor and flupyradifurone also reduced pollen efficacy and cocoon weight, and sulfoxaflor reduced pollen consumption and increased mortality. The expression of detoxification genes differed across pollen nutrition types, but was not enhanced after exposure to thiacloprid. Our findings highlight that lowered diversity of pollen nutrition and high field-realistic exposure to nAChR modulating insecticides negatively affected the development of O. bicornis, but we found no mitigation of negative pesticide impacts through increased pollen diversity. These results have important implications for risk assessment for bee pollinators, indicating that negative effects of nAChR modulating insecticides to developing solitary bees are currently underestimated. © 2023 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169494,912,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181078099&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.169494&partnerID=40&md5=45d2079d1a40c7b05b3d23abf4447373,Scopus,"['4-Butyrolactone', 'Acetylcholine receptor', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'bee', 'Bees', 'CYP9BU1 gene', 'CYP9BU2 gene', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'Detoxification gene', 'Detoxification gene expression', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental impact', 'flupyradifurone', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'gene', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes expression', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Interactive effect', 'Interactive effects', 'larval development', 'mortality rate', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'nutrition', 'Nutrition', 'nutritional assessment', 'Osmia bicorni', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'Pollen nutrition diversity', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Solitary bee development', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'tebuconazole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'unclassified drug']",,,,0,,1,92

We carried out experiments to study the genetic and molecular basis of NNI tolerance in honeybees, which may underlie the dis-crepancies observed in the literature. We discovered that worker survival post -exposure to an acute oral dose of clothianidin is heritable (H2 = 37.8%). Tolerance to clothianidin was not associated with differences in the expression of detoxifica-tion enzymes in our experiments. Instead, mutations in the primary neonicotinoid detoxification genes CYP9Q1 and CYP9Q3 were strongly associated with worker survival post-clothianidin exposure.

Pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. However, knowledge of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide in beekeeping practice, influencing on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development is lacking. Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group. The data is the first report of neurotoxic effects on honeybee caused by carbendazim, and the sublethal carbendazim may disturb honeybee development and is a potential chemical threating the honeybee colonies. © 2018 Wang, Fan, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Yin, Gao, Chen and Ji.",2018///,2018,10.3389/fgene.2018.00426,9,OCT,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055340918&doi=10.3389%2ffgene.2018.00426&partnerID=40&md5=2c94894cb0a64755b0611080d08a87da,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,94

The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with LD50 values of 18ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22ng for clothianidin, 30ng for thiamethoxam, 75ng for dinotefuran and 138ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with LD50 values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6μg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50μg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees.

Recent evidence indicated honeybee health might be posed a potential threat by widely used neonicotinoids worldwide. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of these insecticides in honeybees especially at an enantiomeric level. In this study, we selected two species of bees, Apis mellifera (A. mellifera) and Apis cerana (A. cerana), to assess the toxicity and molecular mechanism of neonicotinoid dinotefuran and its enantiomers. The results showed that S-dinotefuran was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran to honeybees by oral and contact exposures as much as 114 times. A. cerana was more susceptible to highly toxic enantiomer S-dinotefuran. S-dinotefuran induced the immune system response in A. cerana after 48 h exposure and significant changes were observed in the neuronal signaling of A. mellifera under three forms of dinotefuran exposure. Moreover, molecular docking also revealed that S-dinotefuran formed more hydrogen bonds than R-dinotefuran with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, indicating the higher toxicity of S-dinotefuran.

However, since few decades, managed bee colonies have declined worldwide. This phenomenon is considered to be multifactorial, with a strong emphasis on both parasites and pesticides. Infection by the parasite Nosema ceranae and exposure to pesticides can contribute to adverse effects, resulting in a perturbation of the honeybee physiology. We thus hypothesized that probiotic treatment could be promising to treat or prevent these disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on N. ceranae-infected and intoxicated honeybees (by the insecticide thiamethoxam and the fungicide boscalid). For this purpose, experiments were conducted with five probiotics. Among them, Pediococcus acidilactici (PA) showed the best protective effect against the parasite and pesticides. PA significantly improved the infected honeybee lifespan as prophylactic and curative treatments (respectively 2.3 fold and 1.7 fold). Furthermore, the exposure to pesticides induced an increase of honeybee mortality compared with the control group (p < .001) that was restored by the PA treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on honeybee lifespan, the PA administration did not induce changes in the gut bacterial communities (neither in abundance or diversity). N. ceranae and the pesticides were shown to deregulate genes involved in honeybee development (vitellogenin), immunity (serine protease 40, defensin) and detoxification system (glutathione peroxidase-like 2, catalase), and these effects were corrected by the PA treatment.

Yet, our understanding of how stressors affect adult drone fertility, survival, and physiology is presently limited. Here, we investigated sex biases in susceptibility to abiotic stressors (cold stress, topical imidacloprid exposure, and topical exposure to a realistic cocktail of pesticides). We found that drones (haploid males) were more sensitive to cold and imidacloprid exposure than workers (sterile, diploid females), but the cocktail was not toxic at the concentrations tested. We corroborated this lack of cocktail toxicity with in-hive exposures via pollen feeding. We then used quantitative proteomics to investigate protein expression profiles in the hemolymph of topically exposed workers and drones, and found that 34 proteins were differentially expressed in exposed drones relative to controls, but none were differentially expressed in exposed workers. Contrary to our hypothesis, we show that drones express surprisingly high baseline levels of putative stress response proteins relative to workers. This suggests that drones’ stress tolerance systems are fundamentally rewired relative to workers, and susceptibility to stress depends on more than simply gene dose or allelic diversity. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1038/s42003-022-03092-7,5,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124776154&doi=10.1038%2fs42003-022-03092-7&partnerID=40&md5=614a421a5156584ebdb4e8019b3529ca,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'female', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'male', 'Male', 'Female', 'physiological stress', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'gene expression regulation', 'sex factor', 'Sex Factors', 'cold', 'Cold Temperature']",,,,0,,1,99

Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98μgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98μg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98μgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11μgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100,1,153,158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892602774&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2013.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=ec4e0e2e11fd0cfd95e2ea6500fb0294,Scopus,,,,,1,,0,556
811,JOUR,Impact of pesticide use on wild bee distributions across the United States,"['Guzman, LM', 'Elle, E', 'Morandin, LA', 'Cobb, NS', 'Chesshire, PR', 'Mccabe, LM', 'Hughes, A', 'Orr, M', ""M'Gonigle, LK""]",NATURE SUSTAINABILITY,"The decline of many wild bee species has major consequences for pollination in natural and agro-ecosystems. One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

638,JOUR,Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Young Adult Honeybee Behaviour,"['Goñalons, C', 'Farina, WM']",PLOS ONE,"Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015/10/21/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000363248400070,,0,"Not molecular, not specific receptors",0,558

As an agonist of the acetylcholine receptor, it attacks the insect nervous system and is extremely effective against various sucking and mining pests. Oral acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid and its main metabolites (5-hydroxyimidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, desnitroimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, olefin, and urea derivative) were investigated in Apis mellifera. Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10-10,000 μg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 μg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 μg/kg) at 72 and 96 h. Out of the six imidacloprid metabolites tested, only two (5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin) exhibited a toxicity close to that of imidacloprid. Olefin LD50 values were lower than those of imidacloprid. The 5-hydroxyimidacloprid showed a lower toxicity than imidacloprid with a LD50 four to six times higher than that of imidacloprid. Urea also appeared as a compound of nonnegligible toxicity by eliciting close to 40% mortality at 1,000 ng/bee (10,000 μg/kg). However, no significant toxicity was observed with 4,5-dihydroxyimidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and desnitroimidacloprid in the range of doses tested. To test chronic toxicity, worker bees were fed sucrose solutions containing 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L of imidacloprid and its metabolites for 10 d. Fifty percent mortality was reached at approximately 8 d. Hence, considering that sucrose syrup was consumed at the mean rate of 12 μl/d and per bee, after an 8-d period the cumulated doses were approximately 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ng/bee (0.1, 1, and 10 μg/kg).

The abundance and diversity of honeybees have been rapidly diminishing, possibly related to the extensive use of insecticides in ecosystems. Sulfoxaflor is a novel sulfoximine insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. However, few studies have addressed the negative effects of sulfoxaflor on honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, adult workers were fed a 50% (w/v) of sugar solution containing different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor for two weeks consecutively. The survival rates, food intake, and body weight of the honeybees significantly decreased after continuous exposure at higher doses (0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor when compared with the control. The change in the metabolites in the honeybee gut was determined using high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics on day 14 after sulfoxaflor treatment. The results revealed that 24 and 105 metabolites changed after exposure to 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L sulfoxaflor, respectively, compared with that of the control groups. A total of 12 changed compounds including pregenolone and glutathione were detected as potential biomarkers, which were eventually found to be enriched in pathways of the steroid hormone biosynthesis (p = 0.0001) and glutathione metabolism (p = 0.021).

448,JOUR,Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor,"['Shi, T.', 'Meng, L.', 'Jiang, X.', 'Cao, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 μg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance.

A suspension of 22% sulfoxaflor concentration was applied on cucumber at full bloom, at the rates of 75 g a.i./ha and 100 g a.i./ha, both with 2 applications at 6-day interval. Colonies were introduced into the tunnels one day after the first application, then mortality and behaviour of the test bees were observed and recorded every day. Cucumber flowers were taken and analysed for sulfoxaflor residues. The second application occurred 6 days later, then, observations of mortality and behaviour were conducted for 5 days, and then the colonies were removed from the tunnels and transported back to the apiary for 14 days additional observation. Besides, general conditions of the colonies were assessed before and after exposure, at the end of the field study. After being introduced into the tunnels, the colonies stabilized after 3 days’ adaption. During the exposure period, sulfoxaflor showed lethal toxicity on bees, but the effect was less than that caused by dimethoate. After being removed from the tunnels, the mortalities of all groups fluctuated at a low level, indicating that sulfoxaflor had no long-term lethal effect on bees. During the whole exposure period, sulfoxaflor had no effect on the flight intensity of the bees. Meanwhile, sulfoxaflor had no obvious adverse effect on the strength and the condition of the test colonies. Residue analysis showed that: on the days of application, the residue of sulfoxaflor in cucumber flower was between 5.004 mg/kg and 5.832 mg/kg.

Among these insecticides, thiacloprid, a commonly used compound with low toxicity, has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on the olfactory and learning abilities of honeybees. The effect of sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid on the antennal activity of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, laboratory-based experiments were conducted in which honeybee larvae were administered thiacloprid (0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L). Using electroantennography (EAG), the impacts of thiacloprid exposure on the antennal selectivity to common floral volatiles were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of sub-lethal exposure on odor-related learning and memory were also assessed. The results of this study reveal, for the first time, that sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid decreased honeybee antenna EAG responses to floral scents, leading to increased olfactory selectivity in the high-dose (1.0 mg/L) group compared to the control group (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.042). The results also suggest that thiacloprid negatively affected odor-associated paired learning acquisition, as well as medium-term (1 h) (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.019) and long-term memory (24 h) (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.037) in adult honeybees. EAG amplitudes were dramatically reduced following R-linalool paired olfactory training (0 mg/L vs. 1.0 mg/L: p = 0.001; 0 mg/L vs. 0.5 mg/L: p = 0.027), while antennal activities only differed significantly in the control between paired and unpaired groups. Our results indicated that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid may affect olfactory perception and learning and memory behaviors in honeybees. These findings have important implications for the safe use of agrochemicals in the environment.

Research has shown that acute, field realistic dosages of neonicotinoids can negatively influence bee learning and memory, with potential consequences for bee behaviour. As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm. Our results suggest that despite a shared mode of action between sulfoxaflor and neonicotinoidbased insecticides, widely-documented effects of neonicotinoids on bee cognition may not be observed with sulfoxaflor, at least at acute exposure regimes.

Like neonicotinoids, sulfoxaflor acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agricultural environments, bees are commonly exposed to combinations of pesticides, and neonicotinoids are known to interact synergistically with fungicides. The objective of our study is to assess the acute oral toxicity of sulfoxaflor alone and in combination with a single dose of fluxapyroxad, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide, in three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis. Because synergism may be dose-dependent, we tested a range of sulfoxaflor doses. Synergistic effects were assessed using three different approaches: Bliss criterion of drugs independence, ratio test comparing LD50s and model deviation ratio. Osmia bicornis was the most sensitive species to sulfoxaflor and both O. bicornis and A. mellifera showed significant synergism between the insecticide and the fungicide. For the most part, these synergistic effects were weak and only occurred at early assessment times and intermediate sulfoxaflor doses. The potential ecological relevance of these effects should be confirmed in field and/or cage studies. Overall, our laboratory results demonstrate that sulfoxaflor is somewhat less toxic than the recently banned neonicotinoids imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, but much more toxic than other neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, thiacloprid) still in use in the EU at the time this study was conducted. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021///,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-86036-1,11,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103413914&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-86036-1&partnerID=40&md5=59f95b35b3fb145cad24be26b364e1ff,Scopus,"['amide', 'Amides', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'drug effect', 'drug potentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'environmental monitoring', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'fluxapyroxad', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative']",,,,0,,0,567

The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

Among pesticides, neonicotinoid insecticides are the biggest threat. Due to their extensive use, they can be found in all agricultural environments, including soil, water, and air, are persistent in the environment, and are highly toxic for honey bees. In addition, infection by different pests and pathogens can act synergistically, weakening bees. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid alone or combined with the microsporidia Nosema ceranae on the immune response, deformed wing virus infection (DWV), gut microbiota, and survival of Africanized honey bees. We found that imidacloprid affected the expression of some genes associated with immunity generating an altered physiological state, although it did not favor DWV or N. ceranae infection. The pesticide alone did not affect honey bee gut microbiota, as previously suggested, but when administered to N. ceranae infected bees, it generated significant changes. Finally, both stress factors caused high mortality rates. Those results illustrate the negative impact of imidacloprid alone or combined with N. ceranae on Africanized honey bees and are useful to understand colony losses in Latin America. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s00248-022-02014-8,85,4,1485,1497,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128741852&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-022-02014-8&partnerID=40&md5=ae0780b379653a3f3d13e29ca7226d55,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'deformed wing virus', 'Nosema', 'Deformed wing virus', 'Imidacloprid', 'intestine flora', 'Nosema ceranae', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Honey bee gut microbiota', 'Honey bee immunity', 'Honey bee survival']",,,,0,,0,571

The main objective of the present study was to evaluate comparatively the health of Carniolan and Africanized honey bees (AHB) co-exposed to thiamethoxam and Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae) spores. Newly-emerged worker honey bees were exposed solely with different sublethal doses of thiamethoxam (2% and 0.2% of LD50 for AHB), which could be consumed by bees under field conditions. Toxicity tests for the Carniolan bees were performed, and the LD50 of thiamethoxam for Carniolan honey bees was 7.86 ng bee-1. Immunohistological analyses were also performed to detect cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and/or N. ceranae treated bees. Thiamethoxam exposure had no negative impact on Nosema development in experimental conditions, but it clearly inhibited cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and Nosema-exposed bees, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical data. Indeed, thiamethoxam exposure only had a minor synergistic toxic effect on midgut tissue when applied as a low dose simultaneously with N. ceranae to AHB and Carniolan honey bees, in comparison with the effect caused by both stressors separately. Our data provides insights into the effects of the neonicotenoid thiamethoxam on the AHB and Carniolan honey bee life span, as well as the effects of simultaneous application of thiamethoxam and N. ceranae spores to honey bees. © 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.12.030,147,,328,336,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957799809&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2015.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=6d713555218035c2b5a1ca0720e7ee43,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,572

Among them, Nosema ceranae and neurotoxic insecticides might act in combination and lead to a higher honeybee mortality. We investigated the molecular response of honeybees exposed to N. ceranae, to insecticides (fipronil or imidacloprid), and to a combination of both stressors. Midgut transcriptional changes induced by these stressors were measured in two independent experiments combining a global RNA-Seq transcriptomic approach with the screening of the expression of selected genes by quantitative RT-PCR. Although N. ceranae-insecticide combinations induced a significant increase in honeybee mortality, we observed that they did not lead to a synergistic effect. According to gene expression profiles, chronic exposure to insecticides had no significant impact on detoxifying genes but repressed the expression of immunity-related genes. Honeybees treated with N. ceranae , alone or in combination with an insecticide, showed a strong alteration of midgut immunity together with modifications affecting cuticle coatings and trehalose metabolism. An increasing impact of treatments on gene expression profiles with time was identified suggesting an absence of stress recovery which could be linked to the higher mortality rates observed. © 2014 Aufauvre et al.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091686,9,3,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898636008&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0091686&partnerID=40&md5=7242b0ce2eb0667f8fd2ff08489d5f78,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,573

Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have a negative impact on honey bees. Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages. All tested honey bees exposed to Varroa had significantly elevated DWV loads.

However, there is limited information about the effect of these stressors on other pollinators such as stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Meliponini). We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation.

In the present study, we focused on the gene expression profile of newly emerged Apis mellifera queen bees after sublethal imidacloprid treatment during the larval stage. Royal jelly containing 1 ppb imidacloprid was provided to larvae for 3 consecutive days (2–4 days postemergence). Queen larvae treated with imidacloprid showed lower capping and emergence rates (35.5% and 24.22%, respectively) than did control larvae (61.68% and 52.95%, respectively), indicating a high failure rate of queen rearing associated with imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage. The molecular response to imidacloprid treatment was examined next. By comparing the gene expression profiles of imidacloprid-treated queen larvae and those of control queen larvae using DESeq2, we identified 215 differentially expressed genes, with 105 and 111 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. Gene Ontology results indicated that chitin binding– and calcium ion binding–related genes were upregulated, while phototransduction- and visual perception–related genes were downregulated. The high mortality rate and altered gene expression profiles suggest that treatment with even 1 ppb imidacloprid can severely impact queen bee survival.

Studies showed a potential link between altered expression of energy metabolism related transcripts and increased homing flight time of foragers exposed to pesticides. In this study, we investigated the effects of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin on longevity, flight behavior, and expression of transcripts involved in endocrine regulation (hbg-3, buffy, vitellogenin) and energy metabolism (cox5a, cox5b, cox17) using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Parallel, a laboratory study was conducted investigating whether pesticide exposure alone without the influence of flight activity caused similar expression patterns as in the RFID experiment. No significant effect on survival, homing flight duration, or return rate of exposed bees was detected. The overall time foragers spent outside the hive was significantly reduced post-exposure. Irrespective of the treatment group, a correlation was observed between cox5a, cox5b, cox17 and hbg-3 expression and prolonged homing flight duration. Our results suggest that flight behavior can impact gene expression and exposure to pesticides adversely affects the expression of genes that are important for maintaining optimal flight capacity.

Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36°C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20°C). At 20°C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36°C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced.

Oral and indirect contact trials were carried out on adult worker honey bees for each pesticide, using commercial formulations. The acute oral toxicity (AOT) LD50 and the acute indirect contact toxicity (ICT) LC50 were calculated. Mean AOT LD50 values at 24 hours (clothianidin 3.53 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 118.74 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.40 ng/honey bee), 48 hours (clothianidin 3.35 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 90.09 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.27 ng/honey bee), and 72 hours (clothianidin 3.28 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 69.68 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.16 ng/honey bee) from test start were of the same order of magnitude of those reported in the literature for all three neonicotinoids.

The challenges posed by novel and reemerging pathogens on bee health means we need to improve our understanding of the immune system, an important barrier to infections and disease. Despite the importance of solitary bees, which are ecologically relevant, our understanding of the genomic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying their immune potential, and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence it is limited. To improve our understanding of the genomic architecture underlying immunity of a key solitary bee pollinator, we characterized putative immune genes of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis. In addition, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets to determine how sexes differ in immune gene expression and splicing but also how pesticide exposure may affect immune gene expression in females. Through comparative genomics, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of more than 500 putative immune-related genes. We found genome-wide patterns of sex-biased gene expression, with greater enrichment of immune-related processes among genes with higher constitutive expression in males than females. Our results also suggest an up-regulation of immune-related genes in response to exposure to two common neonicotinoids, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the gene repertoire, regulation and expression differences in the sexes of O. bicornis, as well as providing additional support for how neonicotinoids can affect immune gene expression, which may affect the capacity of solitary bees to respond to pathogenic threats. © 2022 The Authors.

The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that chronic sublethal thiacloprid can affect honey bee colonies by reducing survival and delaying bee development.

Thus there is still a low residue in plants, and this sublethal dose residue can still cause adverse effects on the behavior and nervous system of flower-visiting insects like bees.【Objective】The objective of this study is to clarify the effect of sublethal dose imidacloprid (a kind of neonicotinoid insecticides) on the nervous physiological and metabolism system of Apis cerana cerana【. Method】In this study, the worker bees were treated with two sublethal concentration gradient doses of 5 and 10 μg•L-1 imidacloprid for 10 days (three biological replicates). After total RNA was extracted, the resulting library was analyzed by RNA-seq. Throughput sequencing, and the bioinformatics technology was used to assemble and annotate the sequence de novo, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after sublethal doses imidacloprid treatment were analyzed by clustering and enrichment. Finally, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology was used to verify the DEGs related to the nervous and metabolic systems.【Result】A total of 9 sequencing libraries were obtained, the ratio of effective sequencing data exceeded 94.45%. From the obtained 37 364 unigenes, 571 DEGs were identified. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG found that the DEGs were mainly related to multiple pathways such as protein translation, redox, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome, indicating that sublethal doses of imidacloprid had an impact on multiple physiological processes and metabolic pathways of A. c. cerana. Nine DEGs (e.g. neuropeptide F (NPF), neuropeptide SIFamide receptor (SIFaR), phosphoinositide 3-dependent kinases (PDK1), A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA3), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10 (ND42), cuticle protein 12 (CP12), and odorant-binding protein (OBP17)) related to nerve signal transmission and metabolic function were selected for RT-qPCR verification. Their expression patterns were completely consistent with the transcriptome results. 【Conclusion】The sublethal dose of imidacloprid can affect lots of aspects of A. c. cerana such as nerve signal transduction, cellular respiration, immune response, maintenance of homeostasis, and olfactory perception. © 2022 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens. Our work demonstrates how RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling can provide detailed novel insight on the mechanisms mediating pesticide toxicity to a key insect pollinator.",2019/04//,2019,10.1111/mec.15047,28,8,1964,1974,,,,0962-1083,WOS:000468200800010,,0,,0,583
300,JOUR,"Interaction of field realistic doses of clothianidin and Varroa destructor parasitism on adult honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health and neural gene expression, and antagonistic effects on differentially expressed genes","['Morfin, N.', 'Goodwin, P.H.', 'Guzman-Novoa, E.']",PLoS ONE,"While many studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides and the parasitic mite Varroa destructor on honey bees (Apis mellifera), more information on the combined effects of such stressors on gene expression, including neural related genes, and their impact on biological pathways is needed. This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors. The reduced numbers of DEGs and KEGG pathways associated with the DEGs for the combined stressors compared to the stressors alone indicates that the interaction of the stressors is not additive or synergistic, but antagonistic. The possible implications of the antagonistic effect on the number of DEGs are discussed. © 2020 Morfin et al.

The nectar- and water-collecting, and climbing abilities of bees are crucial to the survival of the bees and the execution of responsibilities in bee colonies. Besides behavioral impact, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid, especially by the way of RNA-seq at the transcriptomic level, are limited. We treated Apis mellifera L. with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) and determined the effect on behaviors and the transcriptomic changes. The sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid had a limited impact on the survival and syrup consumption of bees, but caused a significant increase in water consumption. Moreover, the climbing ability was significantly impaired by 10 ppb imidacloprid at 8 d. In the RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment indicated a significant down-regulation of muscle-related genes, which might contribute to the impairment in climbing ability of bees. The enriched GO terms were attributed to the up-regulated ribosomal protein genes. Considering the ribosomal and extra-ribosomal functions of the ribosomal proteins, we hypothesized that imidacloprid also causes cell dysfunction.

However, it also simultaneously has adverse effects on the health of important pollinators, such as honey bees. Previous studies have reported that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impaired immunocompetence, learning and memory performance, and homing behaviour in honey bees. In the present study, using LC-MS-based combined with GC–MS-based metabolomic approaches, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the head of honey bee after subchronic exposure to 2 mg/L thiacloprid over 3 days. The estimated total dose of thiacloprid fed to each bee was 0.12 μg. The results showed that there were 115 metabolites significantly affected in thiacloprid-treated bees compared to control. The metabolites with high level of abundance enriched to wide range pathways associated with oxidative stress and detoxification suggest that the honey bees have activated their detoxification system to resistant toxicity of thiacloprid. While, the reduction of serotonin suggest thiacloprid may hinder the brain activity implicated in learning and behaviour development.

High-throughput circular RNA sequencing of the honey bee brain revealed that R-dinotefuran caused more gene regulatory changes than S-dinotefuran. Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses demonstrated that the SERCA, Kca, and Maxik genes may be related to the enantioselective effects of dinotefuran isomers on honey bee olfaction.

Total RNA was extracted from individual larvae and first strand cDNAs were generated. Gene-expression changes in larvae were measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting transcripts for pathogens and genes involved in physiological processes, bee health, immunity, and/or xenobiotic detoxification. Transcript levels for Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein (PGRPSC), a pathogen recognition gene, increased in larvae exposed to Varroa mites (P<0.001) and were not changed in pesticide treated larvae. As expected, Varroa-parasitized brood had higher transcripts of Deformed Wing Virus than did control larvae (P<0.001). Varroa parasitism, arguably coupled with virus infection, resulted in significantly higher transcript abundances for the antimicrobial peptides abaecin, hymenoptaecin, and defensin1. Transcript levels for Prophenoloxidase-activating enzyme (PPOact), an immune end product, were elevated in larvae treated with myclobutanil and chlorothalonil (both are fungicides) (P<0.001). Transcript levels for Hexameric storage protein (Hsp70) were significantly upregulated in imidacloprid, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, and amitraz treated larvae.

It is imperative to identify factors responsible for accelerated declines in bee populations and develop solutions for reversing bee losses. While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees.

217,JOUR,Effects of Flupyradifurone and Two Reference Insecticides Commonly Used in Toxicological Studies on the Larval Proteome of the Honey bee Apis mellifera,"['Kablau, A', 'Erler, S', 'Eckert, JH', 'Pistorius, J', 'Sharbati, S', 'Einspanier, R']",INSECTS,"Simple Summary Insecticides are considered to be one of the major factors of bee decline. In this study, the potential sublethal effects of selected neonicotinoids on honey bee larvae were investigated by protein expression profiling for the first time. The total larval protein expression was investigated by 2D gel electrophoresis after exposure to the insecticides dimethoate, fenoxycarb and flupyradifurone. Protein spots whose concentrations differed significantly from the controls were sequenced and identified against known insect proteins. Although the treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development, the proteome comparisons showed differences in the metabolism, immune response and energy supply of the bee larvae. The strongest influence was found for flupyradifurone, which activates various detoxification pathways, the immune response or tissue regeneration. Our results suggest that there may be a delayed larval development or possibly a reduced honey bee brood vitality at sublethal concentrations. The western honey bee Apis mellifera is globally distributed due to its beekeeping advantages and plays an important role in the global ecology and economy. In recent decades, several studies have raised concerns about bee decline. Discussed are multiple reasons such as increased pathogen pressure, malnutrition or pesticide use. Insecticides are considered to be one of the major factors. In 2013, the use of three neonicotinoids in the field was prohibited in the EU. Flupyradifurone was introduced as a potential successor; it has a comparable mode of action as the banned neonicotinoids. However, there is a limited number of studies on the effects of sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone on honey bees. Particularly, the larval physiological response by means of protein expression has not yet been studied. Hence, the larval protein expression was investigated via 2D gel electrophoresis after following a standardised protocol to apply sublethal concentrations of the active substance (flupyradifurone 10 mg/kg diet) to larval food. The treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development. Proteome comparisons showed clear differences concerning the larval metabolism, immune response and energy supply.

IMD is known to disrupt honey bee physiology and colony health at a relatively low concentration compared to other pesticides. In this study, honey bee colonies were chronically exposed to field-realistic concentrations (5, 20, and 100 ppb) of IMD, and the body weight, flight performance, carbohydrate reserve, and lipid contents of forager bees analyzed. Transcriptome analyses followed by quantitative PCR were also conducted for both nurse and forager bees to elucidate any changes in energy metabolism related to phenotypic disorders. The body weights of newly emerged and nurse bees showed decreasing tendencies as the IMD concentration increased. In forager bees, however, IMD induced a biphasic change in body weight: body weight was decreased at the lower concentrations (5 and 20 ppb) but increased at the higher concentration (100 ppb). Nevertheless, the flight capability of forager bees significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of IMD on target gene transcription in forager bees showed biphasic patterns between low (5 and 20 ppb) and high (100 ppb) concentrations. Nurse bees showed typical features of premature transition to foragers in a concentration-dependent manner. When exposed to low concentrations, forager bees exhibited downregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, upregulation of transporter activity, and a dose-dependent body weight reduction, which were similar to insulin resistance and diabetic symptoms. However, increased lipid metabolism and decreased energy metabolism with body weight gain were observed at high IMD concentration. Considered together, these results suggest that field-realistic doses of IMD alter honey bee energy metabolism in distinctly different ways at low and high concentrations, both of which negatively affect honey bee colony health. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.103759,144,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127010810&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibmb.2022.103759&partnerID=40&md5=7426091034dbc8f5d210a6320833c0af,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Honey bee', 'Imidacloprid', 'body weight', 'Chronic exposure', 'carbohydrate', 'Carbohydrates', 'Body Weight', 'Biphasic effect', 'Carbohydrate metabolism', 'Diabetes']",,,,0,,0,591

RNA-seq was used to discover individual and interactive chemical effects on larval gene expression and to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to reported adult and colony phenotypes. The separate and combined treatments had distinct gene expression profiles which represented differentially affected signaling and metabolic pathways. The molecular signature of the mixture was characterised by additive interactions in canonical stress responses associated with oxidative stress and detoxification, and non-additive interactions in secondary responses including developmental, neurological, and immune pathways. Novel emergent impacts on eye development genes correlated with long-term defects in visual learning performance as adults.

Simultaneously, imidacloprid can cause damage associated with metabolism as well as, neuronal damage, cellular stress, and impairment of the detoxification system. Regarding the thorax–abdomen fractions, glyphosate could lead to cytoskeleton reorganization and a reduction in defense mechanisms, whereas imidacloprid could affect the coordination and impairment of the oxidative stress response. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34185-x,31,33,45954,45969,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197749678&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-34185-x&partnerID=40&md5=c40618ed4a6e7a0abb69778ab51761ae,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'Imidacloprids', 'dose-response relationship', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'Imidacloprid', 'Chronic exposure', 'Glyphosates', 'Proteins', 'metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'protein', 'Exposed to', 'Sublethal dose', 'Detoxification', 'aphid', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', '% reductions', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular biology', 'Neurological effect', 'Neurological effects', 'Neurology', 'Protein-protein interaction networks', 'Protein–protein interaction networks', 'proteome', 'Proteome']",,,,0,,0,594

However, most studies so far conducted have focused on the effect of these stressors separately and in European honey bees. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the impact of both stressors, singly and in combination, on honey bees of African descent that have demonstrated resistance to parasites and pesticides. Africanized honey bees (AHBs, Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier) were inoculated with N. ceranae (1 × 105 spores/bee) and/or chronically exposed for 18 days to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam (0.025 ng/bee) to evaluate their single and combined effects on food consumption, survivorship, N. ceranae infection, and immunity at the cellular and humoral levels. No significant effects by any of the stressors were found for food consumption. However, thiamethoxam was the main stressor associated to a significant decrease in AHB survivorship, whereas N. ceranae was the main stressor affecting their humoral immune response by upregulating the expression of the gene AmHym-1. Additionally, both stressors, separately and combined, significantly decreased the concentration of haemocytes in the haemolymph of the bees. These findings indicate that N. ceranae and thiamethoxam differentially affect the lifespan and immunity of AHBs and do not seem to have synergistic effects when AHBs are simultaneously exposed to both stressors. © 2023 by the authors.",2023///,2023,10.3390/microorganisms11051258,11,5,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160758660&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms11051258&partnerID=40&md5=c25adb86e90ea97d6595e4b6933d44e6,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'gene expression', 'Nosema ceranae', 'neonicotinoid insecticides', 'cellular immunity', 'haemocytes', 'humoral immunity']",,,,0,,0,595

The term ‘caging stress’ characterizes the effects of depriving honey bees of all hive aspects and conditions. Two cohorts of 1 day old sister bees were subjected to different conditions. One cohort was caged and fed different imidacloprid-tainted sugar solutions and the second was marked and introduced back to its natal hive. Physiological bee parameters and diet behavior were monitored daily for caged bees over several weeks. Bee samples from both cohorts were sampled weekly for RNA sequencing and oxidative stress analyses. Imidacloprid induced significant protein damage and post-ingestive aversion responses in caged bees, leading to lower tainted syrup consumption and higher water intake compared with the controls. No differentially expressed genes were observed among caged bees in regards to imidacloprid treatment. However, significant upregulation in antioxidant genes was recorded in caged bees as compared with hive bees, with overwhelming downregulation in all gene categories in caged bees at week 4. We identified two sets of genes that were constantly regulated in caged bees, including Rsod with unknown function in insects that could potentially characterize caging stress in honey bees. © 2019.

This study measured memory with the proboscis extension response (PER) assay as well as the expression of neural genes in bees chronically exposed to three different sublethal doses of the insecticide clothianidin and/or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The proportion of bees that positively responded to PER at 24 and 48 h post-training (hpt) was significantly reduced when exposed to clothianidin. V. destructor parasitism reduced the proportion of bees that responded to PER at 48 hpt. Combined effects between the lowest clothianidin dose and V. destructor for the proportion of bees that responded to PER were found at 24 hpt. Clothianidin, V. destructor and their combination differentially affected the expression of the neural-related genes, AmNrx-1 (neurexin), AmNlg-1 (neuroligin), and AmAChE-2 (acetylcholinesterase). Different doses of clothianidin down-regulated or up-regulated the genes, whereas V. destructor tended to have a down-regulatory effect. It appears that clothianidin and V. destructor affected neural processes in honey bees through different mechanisms. © 2020 by the authors.

494,JOUR,"Apis cerana Is Less Sensitive to Most Neonicotinoids, despite of Their Smaller Body Mass","['Yue, M.', 'Luo, S.', 'Liu, J.', 'Wu, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Multiple stressors and interaction between them may be responsible for the decline of global pollinators. Among them, exposure to neonicotinoids has been getting more attention and has been considered as a main stressor. The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Chinese indigenous honey bee (Apis cerana F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are two managed honey bee species in China. These two species are widely used in beekeeping, and many wild A. cerana is widely spread in forests and contributes to the ecosystem. It is predicated that A. cerana is more sensitive to insecticides than A. mellifera due to their smaller mass. Here, we found that although the body mass of A. cerana is significantly lower than A. mellifera, the sensitivity of the two species to neonicotinoids are not associated with their body mass but depended on the chemical structure of neonicotinoids. To dinotefuran, the two species showed the similar sensitivity. To acetamiprid, A. mellifera was less sensitive than A. cerana. However, to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, A. mellifera was more sensitive than A. cerana. These results suggested that the sensitivity of honey bees to neonicotinoids is closely associated with the structure of pesticides, but not with body mass of bees. It is also indicated that the hazards of pesticides to the different pollinators could not be inferred from one species to another. © 2017 The Author(s) 2017.

Compared with the well-studied roles of these pesticides in nontarget site (including midgut, ovary, or salivary glands), little has been reported in the target sites, the brain. In the current study, laboratory-reared adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL technique for DNA labeling. We observed significantly increased apoptotic markers in dose- and time-dependent manners in brains of bees exposed to imidacloprid. Neuronal activated caspase-3 and mRNA levels of caspase-1, as detected by immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively, were significantly increased, suggesting that sublethal doses of imidacloprid may induce the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the overlap of apoptosis and autophagy in neurons was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It further suggests that a relationship exists between neurotoxicity and behavioral changes induced by sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that there is a need to determine reasonable limits for imidacloprid application in the field to protect pollinators. © The Authors 2015.

Sublethal doses might, therefore, impair neural processes necessary for adaptive experience dependent behaviour and thus reduce the fitness of pollinating insects on the individual and community level. First, the question was addressed whether clothianidin has an aversive taste for honey bees and concluded with both a laboratory and a semi-field experiment that bees are unable to distinguish between control and contaminated sucrose solutions. In the laboratory, proboscis extension response conditioning was performed with forager bees exposed to different concentrations of clothianidin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.8 ng/bee)before learning, after learning during memory consolidation, and just before memory retention. These tests at different timings allowed uncovering an impairment of the consolidation and retrieval of memory due to the exposure to clothianidin.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (LC50/100: 0.014651 ng imidacloprid mu L-1 diet) on the distribution of certain proteins identified in the brain of Apis mellifera worker bees using a MALDI-imaging approach. This technique enables proteomic analysis of tissues in situ by monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biochemical processes occurring at a specific time in specific brain neuropils. For this purpose, foraging bees were exposed to an 8-day diet containing a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid corresponding to the LC50/100. Bees were collected on day 8 of exposure, and their brains analyzed using protein density maps. RESULTS The results showed that exposure to imidacloprid led to a series of biochemical changes, including alterations in synapse regulation, apoptosis regulation and oxidative stress, which may adversely impair the physiology of these colony bees. CONCLUSION Worker bee contact with even tiny amounts of imidacloprid had potent effects leading to the overexpression of a series of proteins related to important cellular processes that were possibly damaged by the insecticide.

After determine the LC50 (14.34ng/μL of diet) of thiamethoxam, larvae were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam equivalent to 1.43ng/μL by acute and subchronic exposure. Morphological and immunocytochemistry analysis of the brains of the exposed bees, showed condensed cells and early cell death in the optic lobes. Additional dose-related effects were observed on larval development.

362,JOUR,Metabolic profiling of Apis mellifera larvae treated with sublethal acetamiprid doses,"['Shi, X.', 'Shi, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Wu, X.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Acetamiprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide used in crop protection worldwide. Such widespread application can pose risks to pollinator insects, particularly to honeybees (Apis mellifera); therefore, the evaluation of the harmful effects of acetamiprid is necessary. Recent studies report behavior and gene expression dysfunction in honeybees, related to acetamiprid contamination. However, most studies do not consider potential metabolism disorders. To examine the effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on the hemolymph metabolism of honeybees, worker bee larvae(2 days old) were fed with sucrose water containing different concentrations of acetamiprid (0, 5, and 25 mg/L) until capped (6 days old). The hemolymph (200 μL) of freshly capped larvae was collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall, increasing acetamiprid exposure induced greater metabolic variations in worker bee larvae(treated groups compared to untreated). In the positive ion mode, 36 common differential metabolites in the acetamiprid-treated groups were screened from the identified differential metabolites. Of these, 19 metabolites were upregulated, and 17 were downregulated. 10 common differential metabolites were screened in the negative ion mode. 3 metabolites were upregulated, and 7 metabolites were downregulated. These common metabolites included traumatic acid, indole etc. These commonly differentiated metabolites were classified as compounds with biological roles, lipids, and phytochemical compounds, and others. The metabolic pathways of common differentiated metabolites with significant differences (P < 0.05) included the metabolism of tryptophan, purines, phenylalanine, etc. As the concentration of acetamiprid increased, the content of traumatic acid increased, the content of tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine and indole decreased, and the content of lipids also decreased. Our results revealed that the damage to honeybee larvae increased when the acetamiprid solution formulations residue in their food had a concentration higher than 5 mg/L, causing metabolic disorders in various substances in larvae. Analysis of these metabolic processes can provide a theoretical basis for further research on the metabolism of acetamiprid-treated honeybees and elucidate the detoxification mechanisms. © 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114716,254,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149329442&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.114716&partnerID=40&md5=1a2438fb811339d64936a616dc9239b0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'honeybee', 'sucrose', 'larva', 'Larva', 'comparative study', 'liquid chromatography', 'Ecotoxicology', 'sublethal dose', 'down regulation', 'unclassified drug', 'metabolism', 'upregulation', 'detoxification', 'hemolymph', 'Honeybee larvae', 'indole', 'insect larva', 'kynurenine', 'lipid', 'Lipids', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometry', 'metabolic disorder', 'metabolic fingerprinting', 'metabolic regulation', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'phenylalanine', 'phytochemical', 'purine', 'sugar intake', 'traumatic acid', 'tryptophan', 'Tryptophan', 'unsaturated fatty acid']",,,,0,,0,608

However, toxicological understanding of neonicotinoid insecticides on gut microbiota is limited. In the present study, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were exposed to a series of nitenpyram for 14 days. Results indicated that nitenpyram exposure decreased the survival and food consumption of honey bees. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that nitenpyram caused significant alterations in the relative abundance of several key gut microbiotas, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis and immunity. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq transcriptomic analysis, we identified a total of 526 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were significantly altered between nitenpyram-treated and control honey bee gut, including several genes related to metabolic, detoxification and immunity. In addition, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed nitenpyram affected several biological processes, of which most were related to metabolism. Collectively, our study demonstrates that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota in honey bee caused by nitenpyram may influence metabolic homeostasis and immunity of bees, and further decrease food consumption and survival of bees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113671,258,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076373514&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2019.113671&partnerID=40&md5=a6380b51b72b1035117ca12ffbb644fc,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,609

In the current study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honeybee larvae in vitro and explored the mechanism of toxicity. The results showed that the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of S-dinotefuran to honeybee larvae was 30.0 μg/larva after oral exposure for 72 h, which was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran (92.7 μg/larva) and R-dinotefuran (183.6 μg/larva). Although the acute toxicity of the three forms of dinotefuran to larvae was lower than that to adults, chronic exposure significantly reduced larval survival, larval weight, and weight of newly emerged adults. Analysis of gene expression and hormone titer indicated that dinotefuran affects larval growth and development by interfering with nutrient digestion and absorption and the molting system. Analysis of hemolymph metabolome further revealed that disturbances in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and energy metabolism are the key mechanisms of dinotefuran toxicity to bee larvae. In addition, melatonin and vitellogenin are used by larvae to cope with dinotefuran-induced oxidative stress.

100,JOUR,Performance of honey bee colonies under a long-lasting dietary exposure to sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid,"['Siede, R.', 'Faust, L.', 'Meixner, M.D.', 'Maus, C.', 'Grünewald, B.', 'Büchler, R.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Substantial honey bee colony losses have occurred periodically in the last decades. The drivers for these losses are not fully understood. The influence of pests and pathogens are beyond dispute, but in addition, chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides has been suggested to affect the performance of honey bee colonies. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations (one realistic worst-case concentration) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to honey bee colonies in a three year replicated colony feeding study. RESULTS: Thiacloprid did not significantly affect the colony strength. No differences between treatment and control were observed for the mortality of bees, the infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the infection levels of viruses. No colony losses occurred during the overwintering seasons. Furthermore, thiacloprid did not influence the constitutive expression of the immunity-related hymenoptaecin gene. However, upregulation of hymenoptaecin expression as a response to bacterial challenge was less pronounced in exposed bees than in control bees. CONCLUSION: Under field conditions, bee colonies are not adversely affected by a long-lasting exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid. No indications were found that field-realistic and higher doses exerted a biologically significant effect on colony performance. © 2017 The Authors.

Larvae were exposed singly and in combination to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and three sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin to evaluate their effects on survivorship, weight, haemocyte counts, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression of the adult bees that subsequently developed. Clothianidin significantly reduced bee weight at the highest dose and was associated with an increase in haemocyte counts at the lowest dose, whereas V. destructor parasitism increased DWV levels, reduced bee emergence, lowered weight and reduced haemocyte counts. An interaction between the two stressors was observed for weight at emergence. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), V. destructor infestation resulted in broader down-regulatory effects related to immunity that was often shared with the combined stressors, while clothianidin resulted in a broader up-regulatory effect more related to central metabolic pathways that was often shared with the combined stressors. Parasites and abiotic stressors can have complex interactions, including additive effects on reduced weight, number of up-regulated DEGs and biological pathways associated with metabolism. © 2020 by the authors.

447,JOUR,Interaction between Thiamethoxam and Deformed Wing Virus Type A on Wing Characteristics and Expression of Immune and Apoptosis Genes in Apis mellifera,"['Phokasem, P.', 'Mookhploy, W.', 'Krongdang, S.', 'Sinpoo, C.', 'Chantawannakul, P.']",Insects,"Honey bees are economically important insects for crop pollination. They play a significant role as pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops and produce economical products, such as honey, royal jelly, wax, pollen, propolis, and venom. Despite their ecological and economical importance, the global honey bee population is in decline due to factors including pathogens, parasites, intensive agriculture, and pesticides. Moreover, these factors may be interlinked and exacerbate the loss of honey bees. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between a pesticide, thiamethoxam, and deformed wing virus type A (DWV-A) to honey bees and the effects on survival rate, wing characteristics, and expression of immune and apoptosis genes in Apis mellifera. We described the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A on honey bee wing characteristics, DWV-A loads, and the expressions of immune (defensin, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin) and apoptosis genes (buffy, apaf1, caspase3-like, caspase8-like, and caspase9-like). Honey bee larvae were fed with three different thiamethoxam doses (0.001, 1.4, and 14.3 ng/µL of the diet). Then, thiamethoxam-treated white-eyed pupae were injected with 107 copy numbers/honey bee of the DWV-A genome. The interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A caused a high mortality rate, crippled wings in newly emerged adult honey bees (100%), and resulted in induced expression of hymenoptaecin gene compared to the control group, while downregulation of caspase8-like, caspase9-like genes compared to the DWV injection group. Therefore, the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A might have a deleterious effect on honey bee lifespan. The results from this study could be used as a tool to combat DWV-A infection and mitigate pesticide usage to alleviate the decrease in the honey bee population. © 2022 by the authors.

Imidacloprid is a widely used systemic insecticide that can be found in the pollen and nectar of plants and has the potential to negatively impact the development of bee larvae. We investigated the effects of oral exposure to a realistic field concentration (20.5 ng g−1) of imidacloprid on the midgut and fat body of Apis mellifera worker larvae. Our results showed that larvae exposed to imidacloprid exhibited changes in the midgut epithelium, including disorganization of the brush border, nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasm vacuolization, and release of cell fragments indication cell death. Additionally, histochemical analysis revealed that the midgut brush border glycocalyx was disorganized in exposed larvae. The fat body cells of imidacloprid-exposed larvae had a decrease in the size of lipid droplets from 50 to 8 μm and increase of 100 % of protein content, suggesting possible responses to the stress caused by the insecticide. However, the expression of de cdc20 gene, which plays a role in cell proliferation, was not affected in the midgut and fat body of treated larvae.

Fungicides are authorized for use during crop blooms because of their low acute toxicity to honey bees. Thus, a bee that might have been previously exposed to pesticides through contaminated food may be subjected to fungicide spraying when it initiates its first flight outside the hive. In this study, we assessed the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide in bees with different toxicological statuses. Three days after emergence, bees were subjected to chronic exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid and the herbicide glyphosate, either individually or in a binary mixture, at environmental concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 μg/L in food (0.0083 and 0.083 μg/kg) for 30 days. Seven days after the beginning of chronic exposure to the pesticides (10 days after emergence), the bees were subjected to spraying with the fungicide difenoconazole at the registered field dosage. The results showed a delayed significant decrease in survival when honey bees were treated with the fungicide. Fungicide toxicity increased when honey bees were chronically exposed to glyphosate at the lowest concentration, decreased when they were exposed to imidacloprid, and did not significantly change when they were exposed to the binary mixture regardless of the concentration. Bees exposed to all of these pesticide combinations showed physiological disruptions, revealed by the modulation of several life history traits related mainly to metabolism, even when no effect of the other pesticides on fungicide toxicity was observed.

147,JOUR,Field rates of Sivanto™ (flupyradifurone) and Transform® (sulfoxaflor) increase oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Chakrabarti, P.', 'Carlson, E.A.', 'Lucas, H.M.', 'Melathopoulos, A.P.', 'Sagili, R.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Pesticide exposures can have detrimental impacts on bee pollinators, ranging from immediate mortality to sub-lethal impacts. Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto™ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform®. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted—a shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto™ and Transform®, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto™ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform® exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto™ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto™, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. © 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

The results revealed that bee survival was substantially reduced with increasing spinosad concentrations. The LC50 of the bioinsecticide compromised general group activity, caused morphological alterations in the midgut and intensified the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in this organ.

The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 μg active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. © 2012 Tomé et al.",2012///,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0038406,7,6,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861849676&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0038406&partnerID=40&md5=c79d1d494822feae704376b9953a9f04,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,619

To do that, we used a worst-case exposure scenario and fed bees for 21 days with a sublethal and field-relevant concentration of sulfoxaflor (0.3 ppb) which represents the calculated LC5 value of Closer®. A total of six colonies was assigned to the pesticide or control treatment. Then, we evaluated the colony development and activity as well as the weight and foraging activity of individual foraging bees. We also revealed that sublethal Closer® exposure impacted honey bee colony growth and activity by reducing bee bread, honey, and brood production, as well as weight and foraging performance of individual bees when colonies were kept under field conditions. Given the findings of this study, as well as comparable findings reported on spray application of Closer® using standard application practices in semi-field conditions, sulfoxaflor’s potential harm to pollinators at realistic levels merits additional investigation particularly in combination with other stressors to better understand how novel insecticides influence pollinators and pollination services. © 2022, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00937-2,53,2,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128906340&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-022-00937-2&partnerID=40&md5=decbcb12f59fb9d8efedea098c7db1eb,Scopus,"['foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'growth response', 'honey bees', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'pesticides', 'pollination', 'pollinators', 'sulfoximines']",,,,0,,0,620

Thiamethoxam and spinosad are widely used as pesticides in agriculture but they have become an important concern for beekeepers and researchers focusing on bee health; multiple reports stressed adverse effects on bees, notably on honey bees. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two insecticides on the development of the HPGs and on the survival of Apis mellifera intermissa a native African subspecies of honey bee present in Algeria. Newly emerged workers were acutely and chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and spinosad through sugar syrup and pollen pastry. The effects of these insecticides were assessed by measuring the size of HPGs acini and the total head protein content. The survival of the workers was also evaluated over 60 days when they were chronically exposed to the insecticides at concentrations corresponding to LC25 and LC10. We found that the insecticide-treated workers, after both acute and chronic exposure, exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped HPG acini. The total head protein content also decreased in treated individuals with the two concentrations of insecticides at day 6 and 9 compared to the respective controls. While the control group exhibited an LC25 (i.e. the time needed to kill 50% of the tested workers) of 22 days, the LC25 was only 3 days for the workers exposed to the LC25 of spinosad and all workers were dead at day 17. In contrast, thiamethoxam exposure at LC25 had no significant detrimental effect on honey bee survival. This study demonstrated the toxicity of thiamethoxam and spinosad to workers of A. mellifera intermissa and highlighted potential detrimental effects of the bioinsecticide spinosad on HPGs and survival of the bee workers.",2020///,2020,10.1127/entomologia/2020/0796,40,2,207,215,,,,0171-8177,WOS:000531551400009,,0,,0,621

Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control, 0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg-1, during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment. At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild (0.2-0.8 mg kg-1) we detected minimal negative effects to bumble bee colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at 8.0 mg kg-1 spinosad, about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a 'worst case' field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg-1 were slower foragers on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad treated colonies. Inclusion of similar sub-lethal assays to detect effects of pesticides on pollinators would aid in development of environmentally responsible pest management strategies. © 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005///,2005,10.1002/ps.1058,61,7,619,626,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21244438023&doi=10.1002%2fps.1058&partnerID=40&md5=065515d234468618ae230bc31e399229,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,622

Sublethal effects, such as behavior alterations, are neglected in pesticide regulation for pollinators. However, these effects can bring important information to understanding the impacts of pesticides on bees' daily activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/μL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/μL) on the behavior of the Neotropical solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male bees were exposed to these chemicals continuously for 48 h, followed by an additional 48 h without contaminated food, totaling 96 h of observation. We used five experimental groups: control, solvent control, insecticide, fungicide, and pesticide mixture (insecticide + fungicide). Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli. Bees exposed to acetamiprid and pesticide mixture showed lethargic movements and impaired locomotion at 48 h. Notably, these behavioral effects were no longer evident after the bees consumed uncontaminated food for an additional 48 h, totaling 96 h from the start of pesticide exposure. Only fungicide exposure did not result in any behavioral or brain histological changes. Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees.

The effects of these pesticides and their combined on the flight capability of Apis cerana, and the potential underlying mechanisms remain uncertain. To investigate these effects, we carried out flight mill, transcriptome, and metabolome experiments. Our findings reveal that individual acute oral treatments with pesticides, specifically 20 μL of 10 ng/g imidacloprid (0.2 ng per bee), 30 ng/g chlorpyrifos (0.6 ng per bee), and 60 ng/g glyphosate (1.2 ng per bee), did not impact the flight capability of the bees. However, when bees were exposed to a combination of two or three pesticides, a notable reduction in flight duration and distance was observed. In the transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified 307 transcripts and 17 metabolites that exhibited differential expression following exposure to combined pesticides, primarily associated with metabolic pathways involved in energy regulation. Our results illuminate the intricate effects and potential hazards posed by combined pesticide exposures on bee behavior.

The tests were carried out in vitro on caged bees. Significantly lower mortality rate was observed in intoxicated bees treated by a mixture of phenolic compounds compared with the intoxicated and the untreated bees.

However, given the economic and ecological importance of stingless bees such as Melipona scutellaris in the Neotropical region, as well as the lack of studies on the effect of insecticides on these bees, toxicity tests for stingless bees should be carried out to understand whether insecticides affect both species of bees in the same manner. Thus, the present study quantified the differential sensitivity of the bees M. scutellaris and A. mellifera to the oral ingestion of the insecticide thiamethoxam by determining the mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), and their effect on the insecticide target organ, the brain. The results showed that the stingless bee is more sensitive to the insecticide than A. mellifera, with a lower LC50 of 0.0543 ng active ingredient (a.i.)/μL for the stingless bee compared to 0.227 ng a.i./μL for A. mellifera. When exposed to a sublethal concentration, morphological and ultrastructural analyses were performed and evidenced a significant increase in spaces between nerve cells of both species.

Toxicity data are submitted to support these assessments and the USEPA maintains a large database containing acute and chronic toxicity data on adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera), which USEPA considers a surrogate for Apis and non-Apis bees. We compared these toxicity data to explore possible trends. This analysis indicated a significant correlation between acute contact and oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for adult honey bees (ρ = 0.74, p <0.0001). Using default EPA modeling assumptions, where exposure for an individual bee is roughly 12x lower through contact than through ingestion, the analysis indicates that the oral LD50 is similarly if not more protective of the contact LD50 for the majority of pesticides and modes of action evaluated. The analysis also provided evidence that compounds with a lower acute toxicity for adults through contact and oral exposure pathways may still be acutely toxic for larvae. The acute toxicity of herbicides and fungicides was higher for larvae relative to oral and contact toxicity for adult honey bees for the same compounds and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from chronic toxicity studies were lower for larvae relative to adults, indicating increased sensitivity of larvae. When comparing 8-day LD50 values between single dose larval acute studies to those derived from repeat dose 22-day larval chronic toxicity studies, the LD50 values derived from chronic studies were significantly lower than those from acute toxicity tests (Z = -37, p = 0.03).

We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria.

Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1) control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds) or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee neuronal activity.

Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-Term colony functioning.

Tank mixtures are often common practice by farmers, and mostly their effects on honey bees are not routinely assessed. To enable a realistic assessment of laboratory-reported effects of a combination of the insecticide thiacloprid and fungicide prochloraz on honey bees, a large-scale field study with spray application in winter oilseed rape was conducted in four regions in Germany. Several parameters were investigated, including mortality, flight activity, and colony development. Residue analysis of various materials (e.g., dead bees, nectar, and pollen) was conducted to assess exposure level. We observed several intoxication symptoms 2 h after application, including a high number of moribund bees and dead bees on the first day after application (DAA +1) compared to the control. Adverse effects were observed on the number of open brood cells, with a significant reduction of approximately 22% compared to control over the experimental period. High residue concentrations were detected on flowers and dead bees on the day of application, which decreased rapidly within six days.

They have been found abundantly in the beehive, particularly in pollen. Few studies have analysed effects on honeybee larvae, and little is known about effects of insecticide-fungicide-mixtures, although this is a highly realistic exposure scenario. We asked whether the combination of a frequently used insecticide and fungicides would affect developing bees. Honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera carnica) were reared in vitro on larval diets containing different PPPs at two concentrations, derived from residues found in pollen. We used the neonicotinoid acetamiprid, the combined fungicides boscalid/dimoxystrobin and the mixture of all three substances. Mortality was assessed at larval, pupal, and adult stages, and the size and weight of newly emerged bees were measured. The insecticide treatment in higher concentrations significantly reduced larval and adult survival. Interestingly, survival was not affected by the high concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture. However, negative synergistic effects on adult survival were caused by the low concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture, which had no effect when applied alone. The lower concentrated combined fungicides led to significantly lighter adult bees, although the survival was unaffected. Our results suggest that environmental relevant concentrations can be harmful to honeybees. To fully understand the interaction of different PPPs, more combinations and concentrations should be studied in social and solitary bees with possibly different sensitivities. © 2024 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124643,360,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201208997&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124643&partnerID=40&md5=d04e5777776999dec4278c9d6af6fef8,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollution exposure', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'Larva', 'Neonicotinoid', 'mortality', 'growth, development and aging', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'unclassified drug', 'in vitro study', 'nontarget organism', 'fungicide', 'LC50', 'Synergistic effect', 'Fungicides', '2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'dimoxystrobin', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Non-SBI fungicide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergism', 'microflora', 'Plant protection products', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'biphenyl derivative', 'Niacinamide', 'nicotinamide', 'humidity', 'royal jelly', 'antifungal agent', 'binocular vision', 'body composition', 'environmental decision making', 'food composition', 'food industry', 'fungus growth', 'health care cost', 'In vitro larval rearing', 'In-vitro', 'Larval diet', 'methylbenzethonium chloride', 'Realistic exposure scenario', 'size', 'voriconazole', 'weight']",,,,0,,0,633

However, the impacts of parasitic Nosema ceranae to host fitness during long-term pesticide exposure-induced stress is largely unknown. In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to a sublethal dose of dinotefuran, in the presence or absence of N. ceranae, was examined in terms of survival, food consumption, detoxification enzyme activities and gut microbial community. The interaction between dinotefuran and Nosema ceranae on the survival of honey bee was synergistic. Co-exposure to dinotefuran and N. ceranae led to less food consumption and greater changes of enzyme activities involved in defenses against oxidative stress. Particularly, N. ceranae and dinotefuran-N. ceranae co-exposure significantly impacted the gut microbiota structure and richness in adult honey bees, while dinotefuran alone did not show significant alternation of core gut microbiota compared to the control group. We herein demonstrated that chronical exposure to dinotefuran decreases honey bee's survival but is not steadily associated with the gut microbiota dysbiosis; by contrast, N. ceranae parasitism plays a dominant role in the combination in influencing the gut microbial community of the host honey bee.

Herein, we orally exposed honey bee colonies to sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid (20 μg/L) under isolated conditions. After one month of continuous exposure, the emerging bees and queens were collected and analyzed via high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics using a data-independent acquisition strategy. Six and 34 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the emerging bees and queens, respectively. Mrjp3 was the only DEP found in both sample types/castes, and its opposite regulation illustrated a differential response. The DEPs in the emerging bees (H/ACA RNP, Rap1GAP, Mrjp3, and JHE) suggested that sublethal exposure to acetamiprid affected cell cycle-related signaling, which may affect the life history of workers in the colony. The DEPs with increased levels in queens, such as Mrjps 1–4 and 6–7, hymenoptaecin, and apidaecin 22, indicated an activated immune response. Additionally, the level of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the mevalonate pathway and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in queens. The impaired utilization of juvenile hormone in queens supported the identification of additional DEPs. Furthermore, the proteome changes suggested the existence of increased neonicotinoid detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and increased amino acid metabolism. The results suggest that the continuous exposure of bee colonies to acetamiprid at low doses (nanograms per gram in feed) may pose a threat to the colonies. The different exposure routes and durations for the emerging bees and queens in our experiment must be considered, i.e., the emerging bees were exposed as larvae via feeding royal jelly and beebread provided by workers (nurse bees), whereas the queens were fed royal jelly throughout the experiment.

Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells, indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior. Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level, only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental effects of clothianidin were observed. Given these findings, neonicotinoid risk needs to be considered independently for each compound and target species. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep24764,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964886747&doi=10.1038%2fsrep24764&partnerID=40&md5=8f1f4a2a435a30867ab553fde21e0693,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,637
173,JOUR,Increased survival of honeybees in the laboratory after simultaneous exposure to low doses of pesticides and bacteria,"['Dickel, F', 'Münch, D', 'Amdam, GV', 'Mappes, J', 'Freitak, D']",PLOS ONE,"Recent studies of honeybees and bumblebees have examined combinatory effects of different stressors, as insect pollinators are naturally exposed to multiple stressors. At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation.",2018/01/31/,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0191256,13,1,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000423668400041,,0,,0,638
136,JOUR,Compound and dose-dependent effects of two neonicotinoid pesticides on honey bee (Apis mellifera) metabolic physiology,"['Cook, S.C.']",Insects,"Use of neonicotinoid pesticides is now ubiquitous, and consequently non-targeted arthropods are exposed to their residues at sub-lethal doses. Exposure to these neurotoxins may be a major contributor to poor honey bee colony health. Few studies have explored how sub lethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee metabolic physiology, including nutritional and energetic homeostasis, both of which are important for maintaining colony health. Reported here are results from a study of chronic oral exposure of honey bees to two sub lethal concentrations of clothianidin and imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids altered important aspects of honey bee nutritional and metabolic physiology in a compound and dose-dependent manner; both compounds at low doses reduced honey bee body weight. Low-dose clothianidin exposure resulted in bees having protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and glycogen levels similar to newly emerged bees. High-dose clothianidin exposure lowered lipids and glycogen content of bees. High-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees having depressed metabolic rate. Low-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees consuming low and high levels of protein and carbohydrate rich foods, respectively. Results suggest neonicotinoids interfere with honey bee endocrine neurophysiological pathways. Compound and dose-dependent effects might represent respective chemical structural differences determining an observed effect, and thresholds of compound effects on honey bee physiology. © 2019 by the author.

We provide the first evidence that imidacloprid can impair learning in A. cerana workers exposed as adults or as larvae. Adults that ingested a single imidacloprid dose as low as 0.1ng/bee had significantly reduced olfactory learning acquisition, which was 1.6-fold higher in control bees. Longer-term learning (1-17h after the last learning trial) was also impaired. Bees exposed as larvae to a total dose of 0.24ng/bee did not have reduced survival to adulthood. However, these larval-treated bees had significantly impaired olfactory learning when tested as adults: control bees exhibited up to 4.8-fold better short-term learning acquisition, though longer-term learning was not affected.

The inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities as biochemical indicators were determined in vivo after 24 h in head, thorax, and abdomen of surviving bees obtained after treatments with a view to explore the possible mode of action of these compounds. Results indicated that exposure to spinosad showed toxicity to honey bees with LC50 value of 7.34 mg L-1, followed by oxymatrine (LC50 = 10.68 mg L -1), while chlorfluazuron was the least acutely toxic of the tested compounds (LC50 = 2,526 mg L-1). Oxymatrine and spinosad at the same tested concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1) significantly inhibited AChE activity in different organs of honey bee workers, and high inhibition percentage was obtained with the enzyme isolated from the thorax.

Honey bees have been experiencing high mortality in both the United States and worldwide. Pesticide exposure has been identified as one of the many stressors causing this mortality. Effects of various pesticides have been measured for multiple responses such as learning, memory performance, feeding activity, and thermoregulation. These studies were conducted at many different temperatures (11–35°C); however, few studies compared toxicity of the same pesticide to bees at different temperatures. It is possible that the same pesticide might show different toxicity to honey bees at different temperatures. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered low doses of two neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) at three different temperature scenarios (35°C, 24°C, and a varying temperature) and determined the effects on honey bee survivorship. We discovered that honey bees are much more sensitive to the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam at a constant 24°C or at a varying temperature (night at 13°C and day at 24°C) compared to bees at 35°C.

The effects of agricultural pesticides on honeybee health have therefore raised concern. Bees can be exposed to multiple pesticides that may interact synergistically, amplifying their side effects. Attention has focused on neonicotinoid pesticides, but flupyradifur-one (FPF) is a novel butenolide insecticide that is also systemic and a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. We therefore tested the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of FPF over different seasons and worker types, and the interaction of FPF with a common SBI fungicide, propiconazole. We provide the first demonstration of adverse synergistic effects on bee survival and behaviour (poor coordination, hyperactivity, apathy) even at FPF field-realistic doses (worst-case scenarios). Pesticide effects were significantly influenced by worker type and season. Foragers were consistently more susceptible to the pesticides (4-fold greater effect) than in-hive bees, and both worker types were more strongly affected by FPF in summer as compared with spring. Because risk assessment (RA) requires relatively limited tests that only marginally address bee behaviour and do not consider the influence of bee age and season, our results raise concerns about the safety of approved pesticides, including FPF. We suggest that pesticide RA also test for common chemical mixture synergies on behaviour and survival.",2019/04/03/,2019,10.1098/rspb.2019.0433,286,1900,,,,,,0962-8452,WOS:000465482600027,,0,,0,644
399,JOUR,Impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumble bee energy metabolism are revealed under nectar starvation,"['Fischer, N.', 'Costa, C.P.', 'Hur, M.', 'Kirkwood, J.S.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bumble bees are an important group of insects that provide essential pollination services as a consequence of their foraging behaviors. These pollination services are driven, in part, by energetic exchanges between flowering plants and individual bees. Thus, it is important to examine bumble bee energy metabolism and explore how it might be influenced by external stressors contributing to declines in global pollinator populations. Two stressors that are commonly encountered by bees are insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, and nutritional stress, resulting from deficits in pollen and nectar availability. Our study uses a metabolomic approach to examine the effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on bumble bee metabolism, both alone and in combination with nutritional stress. We hypothesized that exposure to imidacloprid disrupts bumble bee energy metabolism, leading to changes in key metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. We tested this by exposing Bombus impatiens workers to imidacloprid according to one of three exposure paradigms designed to explore how chronic versus more acute (early or late) imidacloprid exposure influences energy metabolite levels, then also subjecting them to artificial nectar starvation. The strongest effects of imidacloprid were observed when bees also experienced nectar starvation, suggesting a combinatorial effect of neonicotinoids and nutritional stress on bumble bee energy metabolism. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on pollinators, and underscores the need for further investigation into the complex interactions between environmental stressors and energy metabolism. © 2023 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169388,912,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181045872&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.169388&partnerID=40&md5=e96c410d5f834c615e3245a4c2e599e4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollination', 'Imidacloprids', 'nectar', 'Apidae', 'Plant Nectar', 'bumblebee', 'metabolism', 'environmental stress', 'Flowering plants', 'pesticide application', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'Bombus impatiens', 'Bumble bees', 'metabolomics', 'Metabolomics', 'angiosperm', 'physiological stress', 'Metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'Bumble bee', 'carbon metabolism', 'Central carbon metabolisms', 'Energy Metabolism', 'nutrient', 'nutrient dynamics', 'Nutrients', 'Nutritional stress', 'starvation']",,,,0,,0,645

This defense can be weakened by environmental factors that may render honey bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Honey bees are frequently exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are being discussed as one of the stress factors that may lead to colony failure. We investigated the sublethal effects of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin on individual immunity, by studying three major aspects of immunocompetence in worker bees: total hemocyte number, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. In laboratory experiments, we found a strong impact of all three neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid (24 h oral exposure, 200 μg/l or 2000. μg/l) and imidacloprid (1 μg/l or 10 μg/l) reduced hemocyte density, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity even at field realistic concentrations. Clothianidin had an effect on these immune parameters only at higher than field realistic concentrations (50-200 μg/l).

This study aims to investigate effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on lifespans and foraging behaviors of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) under natural swarm conditions. Newly emerged worker bees of each treatment received a drop of 1.5 μL acetamiprid solution (containing 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg/bee acetamiprid, diluted by water) on the thorax respectively. Bees from 2-day-old to deadline were monitored on foraging behaviors involving the age of bee for first foraging flights, rotating day-off status and the number of foraging flights using the radio frequency identification (RFID) system. We found that acetamiprid at 2 μg/bee significantly reduced the lifespan, induced precocious foraging activity, influenced the rotating day-off status and decreased foraging flights of worker bees.

Therefore, new compounds, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), have recently been developed as 'safer' alternatives. FPF is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, similar to neonicotinoids. Given the novelty of FPF, what data exist are focused mostly on assessing the effect of FPF on pollinator mortality. One important avenue for investigation is the potential effect of FPF on the sensitivity of nectar foragers, such as Apis mellifera, to sucrose concentrations. Neonicotinoids can alter this sucrose responsiveness and disrupt foraging. Compounding this effect, neonicotinoid-containing solutions are preferred by A. mellifera over pure sucrose solutions. We therefore conducted four studies, administering FPF under both acute and chronic conditions, and at field-realistic and higher than field-realistic doses, to assess the influence of FPF exposure on sucrose responsiveness and sucrose solutions with FPF in A. mellifera nectar foragers. RESULTS We found no evidence that FPF exposure under acute or chronic field-realistic conditions significantly altered sucrose responsiveness, and we did not find that bees exposed to FPF consumed more of the solution. However, at the much higher median lethal dose (48 h), among bees that survived, FPF-exposed foragers responded to significantly lower concentrations of sucrose than controls and responded at significantly higher rates to all concentrations of sucrose than controls. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that FPF alters the sucrose responsiveness of nectar foragers at field-realistic doses during winter or early spring, but caution and further investigation are warranted, particularly on the effects of FPF in conjunction with other stressors.

Furthermore, chronic and acute exposure risk and risk ranking for humans eating honey were investigated, and risks to bees were also considered. The results revealed that 40.8% of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoids tested.

604,JOUR,Immune related gene expression in worker honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) pupae exposed to neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor),"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Cizelj, I.', 'Zorc, M.', 'Čitar, M.', 'Božič, J.', 'Glavan, G.', 'Narat, M.']",PLoS ONE,"Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. © 2017 Tesovnik et al.

Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./μL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level. Therefore, interference of different cellular processes directly affects the health of M. scutellaris by compromising the function of Mt. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158086,850,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136135934&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.158086&partnerID=40&md5=035e984901e7a2b936acba69b8ca1855,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Sublethal effects', 'thiamethoxam', 'Neonicotinoid', 'stingless bee', 'sublethal dose', 'Thiamethoxam', 'gene expression', 'Cell death', 'Genes', 'animal tissue', 'LC50', 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'genetics', 'gene expression profiling', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'differential gene expression', 'Detoxification', 'Transcriptome', 'genetic analysis', 'chemical structure', 'Metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'oxidative stress', 'Transcriptomics', 'cell death', 'Malpighian tubule', 'Malpighian tubules', 'Differentially expressed gene', 'carbon', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Malpighian Tubules', 'polysaccharide', 'Carbon', 'Cellular process', 'De novo assemblies', 'De novo assembly', 'Differentially gene expressed', 'Excretion organ', 'Polysaccharides', 'Tissue regeneration']",,,,0,,0,651

Sulfoxaflor is a new systemic insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agro-environments, bees can be exposed to this compound via contaminated pollen and nectar for long periods of time. Therefore, it is important to assess the potential effects of chronic exposure to sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with fungicides, on pollinators. In this study, we tested the effects of chronic exposure to two field concentrations of sulfoxaflor (20 and 100 ppb) alone and in combination with four concentrations of the fungicide fluxapyroxad (7500, 15,000, 30,000 and 60,000 ppb) on syrup consumption and longevity in females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. Exposure to 20 ppb of sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with the fungicide, stimulated syrup consumption, but did not affect longevity. In contrast, syrup consumption decreased in bees exposed to 100 ppb, all of which died after 2–6 days of exposure. We found no evidence of synergism between the two compounds at any of the two sulfoxaflor concentrations tested.

However, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using an established semi-field experimental set-up and Osmia cornuta as a solitary bee model, we examined the effects of field-realistic concentrations of a common neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin) on male larvae and adults. Besides measuring lethal (i.e., overwintering success and adult survival) and sub-lethal endpoints (i.e., emergence mass and emergence duration), we examined, for the first time, potential effects on the male reproductive physiology of a solitary bee (i.e., sperm quantity and viability). The data revealed no significant effects on any of the measured response variables. This may be due to the low degree of clothianidin exposure (0.56 ng g−1) and/or the apparent low susceptibility of solitary bee larvae to neonicotinoids. Furthermore, it is conceivable that ideal foraging conditions, combined with optimal weather and lack of other environmental stressors, may have improved the ability of bees to cope with the insecticide. To reliably assess and understand the environmental hazards of agrochemicals, a holistic approach, including laboratory, semi-field and field data is required.

A major potential cause of decline is considered to be the interaction between environmental stressors, particularly between exposure to pesticides and pathogens. To explore pesticide–pathogen interactions in an important pollinator insect, the honey bee, we used two new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (SULF), at sublethal and field-realistic doses in a fully crossed experimental design with three common viral honey bee pathogens, Black queen cell virus (BQCV) and Deformed wing virus (DWV) genotypes A and B. Through laboratory experiments in which treatments were administered singly or in combination to individual insects, we recorded harmful effects of FPF and pathogens on honey bee survival and immune gene expression. Though we found no evidence of synergistic interactions among stressors on either honey bee survival or viral load, the combined treatment SULF and DWV-B led to a synergistic upregulation of dicer-like gene expression. We conclude that common viral pathogens pose a major threat to honey bees, while co-exposure to these novel nACHR insecticides does not significantly exacerbate viral impacts on host survival in the laboratory. © 2020 The Authors.

401,JOUR,Larval Pollen stress increases adult susceptibility to clothianidin in honey bees,"['Mogren, C.L.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.B.']",Insects,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under scrutiny for their potential role in honey bee declines. Additionally, reduced access to forage in agricultural areas creates the potential for risk interactions with these pesticides in regions critical for honey production. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient access to pollen during larval development could mitigate stress associated with oral clothianidin exposure in honey bee adults. An apiary was established where pollen traps deprived half of the colonies of pollen, which was then supplemented to the others. Adults were fed 0, 10, 40, 200, or 400 µg/L clothianidin in the laboratory, and larval and adult lipids and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared between feeding treatments. Survival at sublethal concentrations of clothianidin was significantly reduced for adult bees reared in pollen deprived colonies. Adult SOD activity was affected by clothianidin dose but not larval feeding treatment, though within the pollen-deprived cohort, SOD was greater in controls than those fed clothianidin. Larval SOD differed between field replicates, with supplemented colonies having slightly higher activity levels during a period of pollen dearth, indicating that supplementation during these periods is particularly important for mitigating oxidative stress within the hive.

We here present a new approach for testing sublethal and/or synergistic effects in free flying colonies. In our experiment individually marked honey bees were kept in free flying mini-hives and chronically exposed to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Additional groups of bees were challenged with Nosema infections or with combinations of the pesticide and pathogens. Longevity and flight activity of the differentially treated bees were monitored for a period of 18 days. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, no effect of the neonicotinoid treatment on mortality or flight activity could be observed. Although the lifespan of Nosema infected bees were significantly reduced compared to non-infected bees a combination of pesticide and pathogen did not reveal any synergistic effect. Our results indicate that individual bees are less impaired by neonicotinoids if kept within the social environment of the colony.

232,JOUR,LD50 values may be misleading predictors of neonicotinoid toxicity across different bee species,"['Mayack, C.', 'Boff, S.']",Uludag Aricilik Dergisi,"The importance of not only honey bees (Apis mellifera) but also other non-managed bee species and their pollination services has come to light with their recently reported declines. One contributing factor in these declines is thought to be sub-lethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides such as thiacloprid. However, current government regulatory agencies do not require the assessment of insecticide toxicity on bee species other than the honey bee, even though previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to insecticides is not likely to be generalizable from honey bees to non-managed bee species. Replicating standardized protocols and testing five different doses of thiacloprid on individual caged bees, we assessed the acute contact toxicity by calculating mortality and the lethal dose (LD50) value for three bee species with different life history traits: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis. We found that Apis mellifera and Osmia bicomis had significantly higher mortality in comparison to Bombus terrestris, but there was no dose-dependent response for any of the three bee species. Bee size and sex were also not useful predictors of thiacloprid toxicity. These results suggest that solely relying on LD50 values, especially when they do not produce a dose-dependent response, may be misleading when assessing insecticide toxicity risk for honey bees and other non-managed bee species.

We suppose that caffeine might be one of these nutrients. We exposed honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) to 0.7 or 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid, 5.0 μg/mL caffeine in syrup, or 5.0 μg/mL caffeine in syrup plus 0.7 or 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid. After 72 h, the oxidative status and the food intake were verified. Imidacloprid increased glutathione peroxidase and catalase activities. Caffeine alone or with 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid also stimulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase but did not alter the effect of the insecticide on the catalase activity. A significant reduction in the concentration of the thiol group of proteins was observed in the two imidacloprid-fed groups, and the addition of caffeine protected these groups. Imidacloprid increased the malondialdehyde concentration while the addition of caffeine partially decreased this effect. Food intake was higher for bees treated with 2.0 ng/mL imidacloprid. Our results show that imidacloprid increased the food intake resulting in oxidative damage, which was partially reversed by caffeine.

Most studies that have investigated the effects of pesticides on honey bees have focused on the European honey bee (Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)), which is commonly domesticated worldwide. However, the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is widely distributed throughout Asia, and toxicity data are lacking for this species. This study aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. In this study, we determined the acute contact toxicity in A. cerana to various pesticides, including neonicotinoids, fipronil, organophosphorus, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamate, and anthranilic diamide. Based on the test duration of 48 h of contact LD50 tests, A. cerana was most sensitive to dinotefuran (0.0014 lg/bee), followed by thiamethoxam (0.0024 lg/bee) and fipronil (0.0025 lg/bee). Dinotefuran is used extensively in Asia, thereby potentially creating a substantial hazard. More generally, A. cerana was approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than was A. mellifera to most of the pesticides evaluated. The results of our study suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides should not be considered as a single group that acts uniformly on all honey bees, and that more careful management strategies are required to conserve A. cerana populations than A. mellifera.  © The Authors 2017.",2017///,2017,10.1093/jee/tox032,110,2,447,452,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038610300&doi=10.1093%2fjee%2ftox032&partnerID=40&md5=03907053c2465de8a51045f432d7d25e,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,661

As an important pollinator, the bumblebee plays a vital role in agricultural production and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. Previous research has focused on the effects of a single pesticide on pollinating insects; however, the synergistic effects of multiple agents on bumblebees have been not studied in detail. Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos are three of common pesticides known for severe effects on bumblebee health. It is still unknown what synergistic effects of these pesticides on pollinators. In our test, the individual and combined toxicities of chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid to bumblebees after 48 h of oral administration were documented by the equivalent linear equation method. Our results showed that the toxicity of each single pesticide exposure, from high to low, was imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos. All binary and ternary combinations showed synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, our research not only shows that the mixed toxicity of insecticides has a significant effect on bumblebees, but also provides scientific guidelines for assessing the safety risks to bumblebees of these three insecticide compounds.

Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honeybee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee viability are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide carbendazim and the herbicide glyphosate. We also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honeybee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: (i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), (ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, which are important for neuronal function.

Therefore, a better understanding on how the availability and quality of pollen diets can modulate honeybee sensitivity to pesticides is required. For that purpose, we evaluated the toxicity of acute exposure and chronic exposures to field realistic and higher concentrations of azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) in honeybees provided with pollen diets of differing qualities (named S and BQ pollens). We found that pollen intake reduced the toxicity of the acute doses of pesticides. Contrary to azoxystrobin, chronic exposures to sulfoxaflor increased by 13- to 12-fold bee mortality, which was reduced by pollen intake. Most importantly, the risk of death upon exposure to a high concentration of sulfoxaflor was significantly lower for the S pollen diet when compared with the BQ pollen diet. This reduced pesticide toxicity was associated with a higher gene expression of vitellogenin, a glycoprotein that promotes bee longevity, a faster sulfoxaflor metabolization and a lower concentration of the phytochemical p-coumaric acid, known to upregulate detoxification enzymes.

Several potential contributing factors have been identified, and exposure to pesticides is of increasing concern. In maize fields, foraging bees are exposed to residual concentrations of insecticides such as neonicotinoids used for seed coating. Highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoids are also reported to increase AChE activity in other invertebrates exposed to sub-lethal doses. The purpose of this study was therefore to test if the honey bee's AChE activity could be altered by neonicotinoid compounds and to explore possible effects of other common products used in maize fields: atrazine and glyphosate. One week prior to pollen shedding, beehives were placed near three different field types: certified organically grown maize, conventionally grown maize or non-cultivated. At the same time, caged bees were exposed to increasing sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and clothianidin) and herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) under controlled conditions. While increased AChE activity was found in all fields after 2 weeks of exposure, bees close to conventional maize crops showed values higher than those in both organic maize fields and non-cultivated areas. In caged bees, AChE activity increased in response to neonicotinoids, and a slight decrease was observed by glyphosate. These results are discussed with regard to AChE activity as a potential biomarker of exposure for neonicotinoids. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013///,2013,10.1007/s11356-013-1568-2,20,8,5603,5614,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880641487&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-013-1568-2&partnerID=40&md5=827e517d67ade48be6e6b971340c7614,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,666

The aim of this study was to evaluate larval survival, reproductive fitness, and histopathology of honey bee queens exposed to incremental doses (0, 5, 50 ng) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (THI) applied directly to individual late larvae (7 days post-oviposition) of queens. The 5 ng dose represents a calculated high environmental level of exposure for honey bee queen larvae. Morphometric evaluation revealed that the total area of mandibular gland epithelium in queens exposed to 5 and 50 ng THI was reduced by 14% (P =.12) and 25% (P =.001), respectively. Decreased mandibular gland size may alter pheromone production, which could in part explain previously observed negative effects of THI on the reproductive fitness of queens.

The majority of studies examining the effect of neonicotinoids on bees have focussed on social species, namely honey bees and bumble bees. However, most bee species are solitary, their life histories differing considerably from these social species, and thus it is possible that their susceptibility to pesticides may be quite different. Studies that have included solitary bees have produced mixed results regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on survival and reproductive success. While the majority of studies have focused on the effects of adult exposure, bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here we examined the effect of exposure of Osmia bicornis larvae to a range of field-realistic concentrations (0-10 ppb) of the neonicotinoid clothianidin, observing no effect on larval development time, overwintering survival or adult weight. Flow-through respirometry was used to test for latent effects of larval exposure on adult physiological function. We observed differences between male and female bees in the propensity to engage in discontinuous gas exchange; however, no effect of larval clothianidin exposure was observed.

Recent research provided evidence that interactions between ecological stressors are drivers of declining pollinator health and responsible for observed population collapses. We used the honeybee Apis mellifera and conducted a series of experiments to test for long-term effects of a single short exposure to the agricultural pesticide flupyradifurone to a second environmental stressor later in life. To do this, we exposed individuals during their larval development or early adulthood to sublethal dosages of flupyradifurone (0.025 mu g for larvae and 0.645 mu g for imagos), either pure or as part of an agricultural formulation (Sivanto). We afterwards exposed bees to a second ecological stressor infecting individuals with 10,000 spores of the fungal gut parasite Nosema ceranae. We found that pesticide exposures significantly reduced survival of bees and altered the expression of several immune and detoxification genes. The ability of bees to respond to these latter effects differed significantly between colonies, offering opportunities to breed bees with elevated levels of pesticide tolerance in the future. We conclude that short episodes of sublethal pesticide exposures during development are sufficient to trigger effects later in life and could therefore contribute to the widespread declines in bee health.",2019/12/24/,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-56224-1,9,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000508915600002,,0,,0,670

In response to mounting evidence supporting the detrimental effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on pollinators, a novel 'bee safe' butenolide compound, flupyradifurone (FPF) has been registered for use in agricultural use. Although FPF is not a neonicotinoid, like neonicotinoids, it is an excitotoxic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. In addition, A. mellifera faces threats from pathogens, such as the microsporidian endoparasite, Nosema ceranae (Fries et al. 1996). We therefore sought 1) to increase our understanding of the potential effects of FPF on honey bees by focusing on a crucial behavior, the ability to learn and remember an odor associated with a food reward, and 2) to test for a potential synergistic effect on such learning by exposure to FPF and infection with N. ceranae. We found little evidence that FPF significantly alters learning and memory at short-term field-realistic doses. However, at high doses and at chronic, field-realistic exposure, FPF did reduce learning and memory in an olfactory conditioning task.

Therefore, the gut microbiota, which contributes to host homeostasis, may be altered by these stressors. The abundance of major bacterial taxa in the gut was evaluated in response to infection with the intestinal parasite Nosema ceranae or chronic exposure to low doses of the neurotoxic insecticides coumaphos, fipronil, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid. Experiments were performed under laboratory conditions on adult workers collected from hives in February (winter bees) and July (summer bees) and revealed season-dependent changes in the bacterial community composition. N. ceranae and a lethal fipronil treatment increased the relative abundance of both Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi in surviving winter honeybees. The parasite and a sublethal exposure to all insecticides decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. regardless of the season. The similar effects induced by insecticides belonging to distinct molecular families suggested a shared and indirect mode of action on the gut microbiota, possibly through aspecific alterations in gut homeostasis.

Sublethal exposure to neonicotinoids can affect insects’ behavioral and physiological performance, and the detoxification of these pesticides likely affects insects’ metabolism. We measured honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) foragers’ CO2 production rates at different temperatures (25, 30, or 35 °C) after they consumed syrup dosed with a field realistic (5 µg/L) or high (20 µg/L) concentration of a neon-icotinoid insecticide (i.e. imidacloprid) for 48 hours. We found that imidacloprid exposure significantly disrupted honey bees’ non-flight metabolic rates and there was a significant interaction between imidacloprid dosage and ambient temperature. Honey bee foragers dosed with 5 µg/L imidacloprid displayed higher average metabolic rates and those dosed with 20 µg/L imidacloprid displayed similar average metabolic rates compared to the corresponding control group across all temperatures. Exposure to fi eld realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid may have a higher energetic cost for honey bees at 25 °C than at higher ambient tempera-tures. Disrupted energy costs in honey bees fed imidacloprid might be due to the thermoregulation, nerve excitation, or detoxification processes. Metabolic rate changes caused by pesticide exposure could result in less available energy for honey bees to per-form hive duties and forage, which could negatively affect colony health. © 2020, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences.

Inter-individual differences in pesticide sensitivity and/or the level of exposure (e.g., ingestion of pesticide-contaminated matrices) may explain this variability in risk posed by a pesticide. Therefore, to better inform pesticide risk assessment for honeybees, we studied the risk posed by pesticides to two behavioral castes, nurse, and forager bees, which are largely represented within colonies and which exhibit large differences in their physiological backgrounds. For that purpose, we determined the sensitivity of nurses and foragers to azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) upon acute or chronic exposure. Azoxystrobin was found to be weakly toxic to both types of bees. However, foragers were more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than nurses upon acute and chronic exposure. This phenomenon was not explained by better sulfoxaflor metabolization in nurses, but rather by differences in body weight (nurses being 1.6 times heavier than foragers). Foragers consistently consumed more sugar syrup than nurses, and this increased consumption was even more pronounced with pesticide-contaminated syrup (at specific concentrations). Altogether, the stronger susceptibility and exposure of foragers to sulfoxaflor contributed to increases of 2 and tenfold for the acute and chronic risk quotients, respectively, compared to nurses. In conclusion, to increase the safety margin and avoid an under-estimation of the risk posed by insecticides to honeybees, we recommend systematically including forager bees in regulatory tests.",2022/12//,2022,10.1007/s11356-022-21969-2,29,60,90328,90337,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'metabolite', 'worker caste', 'safety', 'Risk quotient', 'Forager', 'Nurse', 'Pesticide metabolization', 'Pesticide sensitivity']",0944-1344,WOS:000828463000005,,0,,0,675

In contrast to applications of single PPPs the effects of tank mixtures are not routinely evaluated in the risk assessment process of PPPs with the exception of known synergistic insecticides and mixing partners. Due to economi-cal constraints and process efficiency PPP mixtures are commonly used in agricultural practices. However, some-times interactions among agrochemicals lead to undesir-able additive and synergistic effects. Especially mixtures of pyrethroids or neonicotinoids with azole fungicides, which inhibit sterol biosynthesis, have a synergistic potential of negatively affecting honey bees. For such mixtures, regulatory restrictions are already in place. These synergistic effects are associated with azole fungicides inhibiting the main detoxification enzyme P450, which hinders the bee to detoxify the insecticide. Further studies provide first evidence for increased impacts of mixtures of insecticides with adjuvants on honey bees.

However, the sublethal effects of pesticide residue levels found in pollen and nectar on pollinators have been studied little. The aim of our research was to study whether oral exposure to the thiacloprid levels found in pollen and nectar affect the learning and long-term memory of bumble bees. We tested the effects of two exposure levels of thiacloprid-based pesticide (Calypso SC480) on buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) in laboratory utilizing a learning performance and memory tasks designed to be difficult enough to reveal large variations across the individuals. Results: The lower exposure level of the thiacloprid-based pesticide impaired the bees’ learning performance but not long-term memory compared to the untreated controls. The higher exposure level caused severe acute symptoms, due to which we were not able to test the learning and memory. Conclusions: Our results show that oral exposure to a thiacloprid-based pesticide, calculated based on residue levels found in pollen and nectar, not only causes sublethal effects but also acute lethal effects on bumble bees. Our study underlines an urgent demand for better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment, and of the effects of those residue levels on pollinators.

In the current study, we evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53, 13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) of spinosad (formulation), and the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied. The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) reduced the survival of workers during development. Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium. Finally, the chronic exposure of larvae to 32.64 ng. a.i. bee(-1) spinosad also altered the remodeling of the midgut during metamorphosis and affected the organization of the PM of larvae, pupae, and adults.

Pathogens and pesticides represent important stressors that influence bumblebee health, both when acting alone or in combination. To better understand bumblebee health, we need to investigate how these factors interact, yet experimental studies to date generally focus on only one or two stressors. The aim of this study is to evaluate how combined effects of four important stressors (the gut parasite Nosema ceranae, the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam, the pyrethroid insecticide cypermethrin and the EBI fungicide tebuconazole) interact to affect bumblebees at the individual and colony levels. We established seven treatment groups of colonies that we pulse exposed to different combinations of these stressors for 2 weeks under laboratory conditions. Colonies were subsequently placed in the field for 7 weeks to evaluate the effect of treatments on the prevalence of N. ceranae in inoculated bumblebees, expression levels of immunity and detoxification-related genes, food collection, weight gain, worker and male numbers, and production of worker brood and reproductives. Exposure to pesticide mixtures reduced food collection by bumblebees. All immunity-related genes were upregulated in the bumblebees inoculated with N. ceranae when they had not been exposed to pesticide mixtures, and bumblebees exposed to the fungicide and the pyrethroid were less likely to have N. ceranae. Combined exposure to the three-pesticide mixture and N. ceranae reduced bumblebee colony growth, and all treatments had detrimental effects on brood production. The groups exposed to the neonicotinoid insecticide produced 40%–76% fewer queens than control colonies. Our findings show that exposure to combinations of stressors that bumblebees frequently come into contact with have detrimental effects on colony health and performance and could therefore have an impact at the population level. These results also have significant implications for current practices and policies for pesticide risk assessment and use as the combinations tested here are frequently applied simultaneously in the field.

We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals exhibit a dysbiosis (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota).

Several of these molecules are toxic to non-target organisms such as pollinators and their lethal dose can be lowered if applied as a mixture. They can cause large and unpredictable problems, spanning from behavioural changes to alterations in the gut. The present work aimed at understanding the synergistic effects on honeybees of a combined inhive exposure to sublethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide penconazole. A multidisciplinary approach was used: honeybee mortality upon exposure was initially tested in cage, and the colonies development monitored. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses via light and transmission electron microscopy were carried out on the gut of larvae and forager honeybees. Moreover, the main pollen foraging sources and the fungal gut microbiota were studied using Next Generation Sequencing; the gut core bacterial taxa were quantified via qPCR. The mortality test showed a negative effect on honeybee survival when exposed to agrochemicals and their mixture in cage but not confirmed at colony level. Microscopy analyses on the gut epithelium indicated no appreciable morphological changes in larvae, newly emerged and forager honeybees exposed in field to the agrochemicals. Nevertheless, the gut microbial profile showed a reduction of Bombilactobacillus and an increase of Lactobacillus and total fungi upon mixture application. Finally, we highlighted for the first time a significant honeybee diet change after pesticide exposure: penconazole, alone or in mixture, significantly altered the pollen foraging preference, with honeybees preferring Hedera pollen. Overall, our inhive results showed no severe effects upon administration of sublethal doses of thiacloprid and penconazole but indicate a change in honeybees foraging preference.

Initially, we determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of thiamethoxam was 4.28 ng a.i./μL of diet. To determine the lethal time 50 (LT50), a survival assay was conducted using diets containing sublethal doses of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 and 1/100 of the LC50. The group of bees exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 had a 41.2% reduction of lifespan. When AHB samples were analyzed by morphological technique we found the presence of condensed cells in the mushroom bodies and optical lobes in exposed honeybees. Through Xylidine Ponceau technique, we found cells which stained more intensely in groups exposed to thiamethoxam. The digestive and regenerative cells of the midgut from exposed bees also showed morphological and histochemical alterations, like cytoplasm vacuolization, increased apocrine secretion and increased cell elimination. Thus, intoxication with a sublethal doses of thiamethoxam can cause impairment in the brain and midgut of AHB and contribute to the honeybee lifespan reduction. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/tox.21842,29,10,1122,1133,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907866418&doi=10.1002%2ftox.21842&partnerID=40&md5=2b4d0e79e6f63b124c5e0f94b208277d,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,682

Agricultural intensification, which is connected with pesticide usage, is among major threats to bees and, thus, to the food security and ecosystem stability. As it may not be possible to cease pesticide usage currently because of the growing demand for food, it is crucial to understand the pesticide toxicities to bees for better protection of pollinator populations. The majority of studies have focused on social bees, and those on solitary bees studied effects of adult exposure, whereas these bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here, the effects of three commonly used insecticide-based plant protection products on the development of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis (red mason bee), were studied by exposing larvae to insecticide-contaminated multifloral pollen. The tested insecticides were: Dursban480EC, containing the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (CHP), Sherpa100EC, containing the pyrethroid cypermethrin (CYP), and Mospilan20SP with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid (ACT). When compared to the control larvae fed with uncontaminated-pollen, both CHP and CYP significantly reduced the O. bicornis larval survival and their body mass at all tested concentrations. In contrast, ACT did not affect either larval survival or body mass, but the length of larval stage to cocoon formation was significantly shortened compared to controls. None of studied insecticides affected the mass of cocooned individuals. However, at least 80% of individuals exposed to any of the tested insecticides died before reaching the adult stage, whereas 43% of the controls emerged successfully after overwintering. Although no clear monotonic dose-response relationships were found, our study showed that at least some insecticide formulations affect the development of O. bicornis even at concentrations actually found in pollen in the field, indicating an urgent need for revising current pesticide usage recommendations. © 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145588,775,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100902427&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.145588&partnerID=40&md5=ada10602eb674fe7d7622c23dbe9b6e0,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Agricultural intensification', 'Agricultural robots', 'Agriculture', 'agrochemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee disease', 'Bees', 'body mass', 'Chemical contamination', 'chlorpyrifos', 'cocoon', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'cypermethrin', 'death', 'Ecological risk assessment', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystem stability', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecotoxicology', 'female', 'Food security', 'Food supply', 'Growing demand', 'insect larva', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larval development', 'larval stage', 'Larval survival', 'male', 'Monotonic dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia rufa', 'overwintering', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide', 'Plant protection products', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Red mason bee', 'risk assessment', 'survival', 'Toxicity']",,,,0,,0,683

While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (<1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks.

312,JOUR,"Insight into Olfactory Learning, Memory, and Mortality of Apis mellifera jemenitica after Exposure to Acetamiprid Insecticide","['Abuagla, M.I.B.', 'Iqbal, J.', 'Raweh, H.S.A.', 'Alqarni, A.S.']",Insects,"The honey bee, a significant crop pollinator, encounters pesticides through various routes of exposure during foraging and flower visitation. Considering the potential threat of pesticide poisoning, the indigenous Saudi bee Apis mellifera jemenitica is susceptible to the risks associated with acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This study investigates the acetamiprid-induced effects on the survival, olfactory learning, and memory formation of A. m. jemenitica through two exposure routes: topical application and oral ingestion. Field-realistic and serially diluted concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 10 ppm) of acetamiprid led to notable mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment, with peak mortality observed at 24 h and 48 h for both exposure routes. Bee mortality was concentration-dependent, increasing with the rising concentration of acetamiprid at the tested time intervals. Food consumption following oral exposure exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern, steadily decreasing with increasing concentrations of acetamiprid. Oral exposure resulted in a substantially higher cumulative mortality (55%) compared to topical exposure (15%), indicating a significant disparity in bee mortality between the two exposure routes. The 24 h post-treatment LC50 values for acetamiprid were 160.33 and 12.76 ppm for topical application and oral ingestion, respectively. The sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of acetamiprid were 15.23, 34.18, and 61.20 ppm, respectively, following topical exposure, and 2.85, 4.77, and 6.91 ppm, respectively, following oral exposure. The sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid significantly decreased learning during the 2nd–3rd conditioning trials and impaired memory formation at 2, 12, and 24 h following both topical and oral exposure routes, compared to the control bees. Notably, the sublethal concentrations were equally effective in impairing bee learning and memory. Taken together, acetamiprid exposure adversely affected bee survival, hindered learning, and impaired the memory retention of learned tasks. © 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/insects15070473,15,7,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199863877&doi=10.3390%2finsects15070473&partnerID=40&md5=5904bd7c130a5053326e3c2a0133b7ad,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'memory', 'toxicity', 'mortality', 'honey bee', 'cognitive skills', 'lethal toxicity', 'olfactory cue', 'oral routes', 'topical routes']",,,,0,,0,685
202,JOUR,Subchronic exposure of honeybees to sublethal doses of pesticides: Effects on behavior,"['Aliouane, Y.', 'El Hassani, A.K.', 'Gary, V.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Lambin, M.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the effects on honeybee behavior of sublethal doses of insecticides chronically administered orally or by contact. Emergent honeybees received a daily dose of insecticide ranging from one-fifth to one-five-hundredth of the median lethal dose (LD50) during 11 d. After exposure to fipronil (0.1 and 0.01 ng/bee), acetamiprid (1 and 0.1 μg/bee), or thiamethoxam (1 and 0.1 ng/bee), behavioral functions of honeybees were tested on day 12. Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open-field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant. Thiamethoxam by contact induced either a significant decrease of olfactory memory 24 h after learning at 0.1 ng/bee or a significant impairment of learning performance with no effect on memory at 1 ng/bee. Responsiveness to antennal sucrose stimulation was significantly decreased for high sucrose concentrations in honeybees treated orally with thiamethoxam (1 ng/bee). The only significant effect of acetamiprid (administered orally, 0.1 μg/bee) was an increase in responsiveness to water. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam tested at the highest dose (one-tenth and one-fifth of their oral LD50, respectively) and fipronil at one-five-hundredth of LD50 have limited effects on the motor, sensory, and cognitive functions of the honeybee.

Finding of this study showed that among these neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiacloprid were most toxic insecticides with 100% mortality at realistic field doses by ingestion method with sugar solution as a substitute of nectar after the exposure of 3hrs. Honeybee's workers exposed with insecticides mixed pollen grains showed that imidacloprid and clothianidin were most toxic as compared to other insecticides at recommended field dose with 100% mortality and minimum mortality with 60% was observed at thiacloprid field dose after 3hrs exposure. The results of contact toxicity showed that all four insecticides were most toxic with wet filter paper with 100% mortality at recommend field dose after the exposure of 3hr, and with dry filter paper imidacloprid and thiacloprid showed 100% mortality and acetamiprid and clothianidin with 53.3% mortality after the exposure of 3hrs at field dose.

Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress.

Recently, populations of honey bees have been declining due to a combination of factors, including the widespread use of agricultural pesticides. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute oral toxicity of different formulated pesticides to honey bee adults. In particular, we assessed the acute oral toxicity of two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, Assail 30SG and thiamethoxam, Actara 25WDG) and two other systemic insecticide products (sulfoxaflor, Closer 2SC and flupyradifurone, Sivanto 200SL), all of which are generally used in pest management programs in commercial apple orchards in the Eastern United States. Honey bees were fed a range of doses of each pesticide in order to create a response curve, and LC50, LC90, and LD50 values were determined. The pesticide formulation containing flupyradifurone as the active ingredient was found to be the least toxic to honey bees followed by the formulations containing sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid.

Besides increasing landscape fragmentation that limit the supply of flower resources, intensive agricultural practices relying on the use of pesticides to control agricultural pests also affect non-target organisms like honey bees. The use of most pesticides containing neonicotinoids has been severely restricted in the European Union, leaving pesticides containing acetamiprid as the only ones that are still authorized. In the meantime, new substances like sulfoxaflor, that have a similar mode of action acting on the insect's nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), have been approved for agricultural use. In Europe and USA, the use of pesticides containing this active ingredient is limited due to toxic effects already reported on bees, but no restrictions regarding this matter were applied in other countries (e.g., Brazil). In this study, homing ability tests with acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor were performed, in which honey bees were fed with three sub-lethal doses from each substance. After exposure, each honey bee was equipped with an RFID chip and released 1 km away from the colony to evaluate their homing ability. No significant effects were detected in honey bees fed with 32, 48 and 61 ng of acetamiprid while a poor performance on their homing ability, with only 28% of them reaching the colony instead of 75%, was detected at a 26 ng/a.s./bee dose of sulfoxaflor. Although, both pesticides act on the nAChR, the higher sulfoxaflor toxicity might be related with the honey bees detoxifying mechanisms, which are more effective on cyano-based neonicotinoids (i.e., acetamiprid) than sulfoximines. With this study we encourage the use of homing ability tests to be a suitable candidate to integrate the future risk assessment scheme, providing valuable data to models predicting effects on colony health that emerge from the individual actions of each bee. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155710,837,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130185757&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.155710&partnerID=40&md5=ff6f430cc716ab62cc8cba0390be93e9,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetylcholine receptor', 'agricultural intensification', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis melifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Europe', 'experimental study', 'Field experiment', 'Field experiments', 'Food products', 'Health risks', 'homing behavior', 'Homing failure', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lethal dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population exposure', 'prediction', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'radiofrequency identification', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'unclassified drug', 'United States']",,,,0,,0,691

Malathion was the most toxic substance to both species, with 48-h median lethal doses (LD50s) of 0.25 ng/bee to A. mellifera and 0.02 ng/bee to T. angustula. Fipronil was also highly toxic and presented a similar toxicity to both species, with 48-h LD50s of 0.5 ng/bee (A. mellifera) and 0.4 ng/bee (T. angustula). Imidacloprid had the lowest acute toxicity with a 48-h LD50 of 29 ng/bee for A. mellifera, whereas T. angustula tolerated exposure higher than 35 ng/bee. Apparent biomarker responses were observed in bees of both species that survived exposure to higher concentrations of malathion (ChE inhibition) and fipronil (increased LPO).

Pesticides have been proposed as a potential cause of this decline. Bees are exposed simultaneously to a variety of agrochemicals, which may cause synergistically detrimental impacts, which are incompletely understood. We investigated the toxicity of the fungicide imazalil in mixture with four common insecticides: fipronil (phenylpyrazoid), cypermethrin (pyrethroid), thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides like imazalil can inhibit P450 detoxification systems in insects and therefore fungicide − insecticide co-occurrence might produce synergistic toxicity in bees. We assessed the impact of dietary fungicide − insecticide mixtures on the mortality and feeding rates of laboratory bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.). RESULTS: Regarding mortality, imazalil synergised the toxicity of fipronil, cypermethrin and thiamethoxam, but not imidacloprid. We found no synergistic effects on feeding rates. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that P450-based detoxification processes are differentially important in mitigating the toxicity of certain insecticides, even those of the same chemical class. Our evidence that cocktail effects can arise in bumble bees should extend concern about the potential impacts of agrochemical mixtures to include wild bee species in farmland. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry",2018///,2018,10.1002/ps.4756,74,3,541,546,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037367733&doi=10.1002%2fps.4756&partnerID=40&md5=d7f182ffc9e1061420199ac837709b25,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,696
261,JOUR,Positive correlation between pesticide consumption and longevity in solitary bees: Are we overlooking fitness trade-offs?,"['Strobl, V.', 'Camenzind, D.', 'Minnameyer, A.', 'Walker, S.', 'Eyer, M.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Straub, L.']",Insects,"The ubiquitous use of pesticides is one major driver for the current loss of biodiversity, and the common practice of simultaneously applying multiple agrochemicals may further contribute. Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup® and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival; however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction. The data suggest that a focus on survival can lead to false-negative results and it appears inevitable to include fitness or at least tokens of fitness at the earliest stage in future risk assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

489,JOUR,Non-optimal ambient temperatures aggravate insecticide toxicity and affect honey bees Apis mellifera L. gene regulation,"['Alburaki, M.', 'Madella, S.', 'Cook, S.C.']",Scientific Reports,"In this study, we conducted a transcriptional analysis of five honey bee genes to examine their functional involvement vis-à-vis ambient temperatures and exposure to imidacloprid. In a 15-day cage experiment, three cohorts of one-day-old sister bees emerged in incubators, were distributed into cages, and maintained at three different temperatures (26 °C, 32 °C, 38 °C). Each cohort was fed a protein patty and three concentrations of imidacloprid-tainted sugar (0 ppb, 5 ppb and 20 ppb) ad libitum. Honey bee mortality, syrup and patty consumption were monitored daily over 15 days. Bees were sampled every three days for a total of five time points. RT-qPCR was used to longitudinally assess gene regulation of Vg, mrjp1, Rsod, AChE-2 and Trx-1 using RNA extracted from whole bee bodies. Kaplan–Meier models show that bees kept at both non-optimal temperatures (26 °C and 38 °C) were more susceptible to imidacloprid, with significantly higher mortality (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the control. At 32 °C, no differences in mortality (P = 0.3) were recorded among treatments. In both imidacloprid treatment groups and the control, the expression of Vg and mrjp1 was significantly downregulated at 26 °C and 38 °C compared to the optimal temperature of 32 °C, indicating major influence of ambient temperature on the regulation of these genes. Within the ambient temperature groups, both imidacloprid treatments exclusively downregulated Vg and mrjp1 at 26 °C. AChE-2 and the poorly characterized Rsod gene were both consistently upregulated at the highest temperature (38 °C) compared to the ideal temperature (32 °C) in all treatment groups. Trx-1 showed no effect to both temperature and imidacloprid treatments and was regulated in an age-related manner. Overall, our results indicate that ambient temperatures amplify imidacloprid toxicity and affect honey bee gene regulation. © 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2023///,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-30264-0,13,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149684649&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-30264-0&partnerID=40&md5=95e4c6ac4d47b7906cde9b5f38f62d79,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'temperature', 'Temperature', 'genetics']",,,,0,,0,698

To explore potential colony-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide at field-relevant concentrations, honey bee colonies were fed 5- and 20-ppb concentrations of clothianidin in sugar syrup while control colonies were fed unadulterated syrup. Two experiments were conducted in successive years at the same site in southern Arizona, and one in the high rainfall environment of Mississippi. Across all three experiments, adult bee masses were about 21% lower among colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin than the untreated control group, but no effects of treatment on brood production were observed. Average daily hive weight losses per day in the 5-ppb clothianidin colonies were about 39% lower post-treatment than in the 20-ppb clothianidin colonies, indicating lower consumption and/or better foraging, but the dry weights of newly-emerged adult bees were on average 6–7% lower in the 5-ppb group compared to the other groups, suggesting a nutritional problem in the 5-ppb group. Internal hive CO2 concentration was higher on average in colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin, which could have resulted from greater CO2 production and/or reduced ventilating activity. Hive temperature average and daily variability were not affected by clothianidin exposure but did differ significantly among trials.

In recent years, this balance has been disrupted greatly by some pesticides, which results in great losses of honeybees worldwide. Previous studies have found that pesticide-caused memory loss might be one of the major reasons for colony loss. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases and are known to cause hyperacetylation of histone cores and influence gene expression. In our study, the HDACi sodium butyrate was applied to honeybees as a dietary supplement. The effect of sodium butyrate on the expression profiles of memory-related genes was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results revealed that this HDACi had up-regulation effects on most of the memory-related genes in bees, even in bees treated with imidacloprid. In addition, using the proboscis extension reflex to evaluate olfactory learning in bees, we found that this HDACi boosted the memory formation of bees after impairment owing to imidacloprid exposure. This study investigated the association between gene expression and memory formation from an epigenetic perspective. Additionally, we further demonstrate the possibility of enhancing bee learning using HDACis and provide initial data for future research.",2018/08//,2018,10.1111/imb.12390,27,4,512,521,,,,0962-1075,WOS:000439998400008,,0,,0,700
487,JOUR,Honeybees (Apis mellifera) modulate dance communication in response to pollution by imidacloprid,"['Zhang, Z.Y.', 'Li, Z.', 'Huang, Q.', 'Yan, W.Y.', 'Zhang, L.Z.', 'Zeng, Z.J.']",Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology,"Imidacloprid, one of the most commonly used insecticides, is highly toxic to honeybees and other beneficial insects. Imidacloprid is a chloronicotinyl insecticide, which has a highly specific affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the honeybee's nervous system. So it may interfere with dance behavior and memory formation. We found the waggle dances were modulated in honeybees fed sucrose water containing imidacloprid (pesticide group) compared to those fed normal sucrose water (control group). In our data, dancers of the pesticide group significantly increased the variance of divergence angle and the return phases in waggle dances than the control group. And the dance followers in pesticide group significantly increased the variance of crop content than the control group. Furthermore, four learning and memory related genes were significantly regulated at the gene expression levels between pesticide and control group. Our data revealed that the sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid impaired the honeybees’ learning and memory and resulted in cognitive disorder. The dancers may adjust their recruitment behavior leading to the observed reduced number of followers. We conclude that modulation of in-hive communication serves to protect the colony from foraging toxic food. © 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.aspen.2020.03.011,23,2,477,482,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082009293&doi=10.1016%2fj.aspen.2020.03.011&partnerID=40&md5=3e24d71cb8c09fbc7d9ddf707da45c37,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,701
501,JOUR,Honey bee (Apis mellifera) exposomes and dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with Nosema ceranae infection,"['Broadrup, RL', 'Mayack, C', 'Schick, SJ', 'Eppley, EJ', 'White, HK', 'Macherone, A']",PLOS ONE,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) health has been severely impacted by multiple environmental stressors including parasitic infection, pesticide exposure, and poor nutrition. The decline in bee health is therefore a complex multifactorial problem which requires a holistic investigative approach. Within the exposome paradigm, the combined exposure to the environment, drugs, food, and individuals' internal biochemistry affects health in positive and negative ways. In the context of the exposome, honey bee hive infection with parasites such as Nosema ceranae is also a form of environmental exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to xenobiotic pesticides and other environmental chemicals increases susceptibility to N. ceranae infection upon incidental exposure to the parasite. We further queried whether these exposures could be linked to changes in conserved metabolic biological pathways. From 30 hives sampled across 10 sites, a total of 2,352 chemical features were found via gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF) in extracts of honey bees collected from each hive. Of these, 20 pesticides were identified and annotated, and found to be significantly associated with N. ceranae infection. We further determined that infected hives were linked to a greater number of xenobiotic exposures, and the relative concentration of the exposures were not linked to the presence of a N. ceranae infection. In the exposome profiles of the bees, we also found chemicals inherent to known biological metabolic pathways of Apis mellifera and identified 9 dysregulated pathways. These findings have led us to posit that for hives exposed to similar chemicals, those that incur multiple, simultaneous xenobiotic stressors have a greater incidence of infection with N. ceranae. Mechanistically, our results suggests the overwhelming nature of these exposures negatively affects the biological functioning of the bee, and could explain how the decline in bee populations is associated with pesticide exposures.",2019/03/07/,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0213249,14,3,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000460638800056,,0,,0,702

Previous efforts have employed experimental approaches using small groups under laboratory conditions to investigate influence of these stressors on honey bee physiology and behaviour, although both the colony level and field conditions play a key role for eusocial honey bees. Here, we challenged honey bee workers under in vivo colony conditions with sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid, the miticide tau-fluvalinate and the endoparasite Nosema ceranae, to investigate potential effects on longevity and behaviour using observation hives. In contrast to previous laboratory studies, our results do not suggest interactions among stressors, but rather lone effects of pesticides and the parasite on mortality and behaviour, respectively. These effects appear to be weak due to different outcomes at the two study sites, thereby suggesting that the role of thiacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and N.ceranae and interactions among them may have been overemphasized.

221,JOUR,Sucrose sensitivity of honey bees is differently affected by dietary protein and a neonicotinoid pesticide,"['Démares, F.J.', 'Crous, K.L.', 'Pirk, C.W.W.', 'Nicolson, S.W.', 'Human, H.']",PLoS ONE,"Over a decade, declines in honey bee colonies have raised worldwide concerns. Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged.

One of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Although the primary mode of action of imidacloprid is on the insect nervous system, it has also been shown to cause changes in insects' digestive physiology and alter the microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The honey bee gut microbiome plays a major role in bee health. Although many studies have shown that imidacloprid affects honey bee behavior, its impact on the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the gut microbiome composition, survivorship, and susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees. Consistent with other studies, we show that imidacloprid exposure results in an elevated mortality of honey bees in the hive and increases the susceptibility to infection by pathogens. However, we did not find evidence that imidacloprid affects the gut bacterial community of honey bees. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that honey bee gut bacteria can grow in the presence of imidacloprid, and we found some evidence that imidacloprid can be metabolized in the bee gut environment. However, none of the individual bee gut bacterial species tested could metabolize imidacloprid, suggesting that the observed metabolism of imidacloprid within in vitro bee gut cultures is not caused by the gut bacteria.

Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence. However, this exposure caused ultra-structural alterations in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria. These alterations indicate possible tissue degeneration, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of thiamethoxam in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees.

Although slight reductions in the responses at the concentrations 10 and 15 µg/kg were observed, all tested sublethal concentrations had showed non-significant effects on the sucrose responsiveness, habitation of the proboscis extension reflex and olfactory learning performance. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to 15 µg/kg affected the specificity of the early long-term memory (24 h). Since the tested concentrations were in the range of field-relevant concentrations, our results strongly suggest that related-effects on winter and summer bees’ sensitivity should also be studied under realistic conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2016///,2016,10.1007/s10646-016-1657-3,25,5,1000,1010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964389403&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-016-1657-3&partnerID=40&md5=9621d17fc9355b904e69be709398623c,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,709

It is unclear how the developing brains of honey bee larvae are affected by sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides when measuring neural processes through behavioural performance in adult bees. In this study, larvae were exposed to three sublethal doses of clothianidin and evaluated 25–36 days later for hygienic and foraging behaviours as adult bees. The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen. These results show that exposure of larvae to clothianidin results in negative effects extending into the adulthood of bees, possibly compromising the colony’s fitness by impairing pathogen control mechanisms and by reducing pollen collection. © 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2019///,2019,10.1007/s13592-019-00672-1,50,5,595,605,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069186106&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-019-00672-1&partnerID=40&md5=dd14ad758753b766c8ca219963a91e3a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,710
175,JOUR,Assessing lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees in a multifactorial context,"['Frizzera, D.', 'Zanni, V.', 'Seffin, E.', 'de Miranda, J.R.', 'Marroni, F.', 'Annoscia, D.', 'Nazzi, F.']",Science of the Total Environment,"The registration of novel pesticides that are subsequently banned because of their unexpected negative effects on non-target species can have a huge environmental impact. Therefore, the pre-emptive evaluation of the potential effects of new compounds is essential. To this aim both lethal and sublethal effects should be assessed in a realistic scenario including the other stressors that can interact with pesticides. However, laboratory studies addressing such interactive effects are rare, while standardized laboratory-based protocols focus on lethal effects and not on sub-lethal effects. We propose to assess both lethal and sublethal effects in a multifactorial context including the other stressors affecting the non-target species. We tested this approach by studying the impact on honey bees of the insecticide sulfoxaflor in combination with a common parasite, a sub-optimal temperature and food deprivation. We studied the survival and the transcriptome of honey bees, to assess both the lethal and the potential sublethal effects of the insecticide, respectively. With this method we show that a field realistic concentration of sulfoxaflor in food does not affect the survival of honey bees; however, the significant impact on some key genes indicates that sublethal effects are possible in a realistically complex scenario. Moreover, our results demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of a novel approach to hazard assessment considering the interactive effects of pesticides. We anticipate our approach to be a starting point for a paradigm shift in toxicology: from an unifactorial, mortality-centered assessment to a multifactorial, comprehensive approach. This is something of the utmost importance to preserve pollination, thus contributing to the sustainability of our food production system. © 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174892,948,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199200773&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.174892&partnerID=40&md5=8054cb5247e56d942ec99eb4e58e71ca,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'human', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollination', 'Article', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Sublethal effects', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'adult', 'honey', 'Lethal effects', 'Varroa', 'nectar', 'Honey bees', 'mortality', 'analysis', 'Honey bee', 'Pollen', 'toxicology', 'gene expression', 'hazard assessment', 'mite infestation', 'Temperature', 'gene', 'pollution effect', 'vitellogenin', 'nontarget organism', 'analysis of variance', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'gene ontology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'RNA sequencing', 'Transcriptome', 'Hazards', 'thermoregulation', 'parasitism', 'Chemical contamination', 'royal jelly', 'food production', 'complementary DNA', 'Hazard assessment', 'Environmental impact', 'statistical analysis', 'Fabaceae', 'Interactive effect', 'Fagopyrum', 'feasibility study', 'gelatin', 'Hazard Assessment', 'killer cell', 'Potential effects', 'RNA polymerase II', 'solid', 'Sustainable development', 'Target species']",,,,0,,0,711

Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8–64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24 h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering. Our study therefore illustrates the difficulties involved in evaluating the economic/ecological significance of pesticide-induced stress in honey bee field studies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.06.038,132,,379,389,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976630167&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2016.06.038&partnerID=40&md5=2f3b5b08a2253fcb03155d02fdd42cde,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,712

Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS: Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L−1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L−1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L−1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L−1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control. A significant decrease in survival, relative to the solvent control, occurred in the 0.8, 1.2 and 8 mg L−1 chlorpyrifos, 0.4, 2 and 10 mg L−1 clothianidin, and 45 mg L−1 dimethoate diets, but not the imidacloprid diets. CONCLUSION: The treatment of larval diets with clothianidin, dimethoate and imidacloprid did not affect survival, developmental rate, or weight of immature honey bees; however, treatment with chlorpyrifos did.

223,JOUR,"Combined nutritional stress and a new systemic pesticide (flupyradifurone, Sivanto®) reduce bee survival, food consumption, flight success, and thermoregulation","['Tong, L.', 'Nieh, J.C.', 'Tosi, S.']",Chemosphere,"Flupyradifurone (FPF, Sivanto®) is a new butenolide insecticide that, like the neonicotinoids, is a systemic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist. However, FPF is considered bee-safe (according to standard Risk Assessment tests), and is thus a potential solution to the adverse effects of other pesticides on beneficial insects. To date, no studies have examined the impact of nutritional stress (decreased food diversity and quality) and FPF exposure on bee health although both stressors can occur, especially around agricultural monocultures. We therefore tested the effects of a field-realistic FPF concentration (4 ppm, FPFdaily dose = 241 ± 4 ng/bee/day, 1/12 of LD50) and nutritional stress (nectar with low-sugar concentrations) on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mortality, food consumption, thermoregulation, flight success (unsuccessful vs. successful), and flight ability (duration, distance, velocity). Flight and thermoregulation are critical to colony health: bees fly to collect food and reproduce, and they thermoregulate to increase flight efficiency and to rear brood. We studied the effects across seasons because seasonality can influence bee sensitivity to environmental stress. We demonstrate that, depending upon season and nutritional stress, FPF can reduce bee survival (−14%), food consumption (−14%), thermoregulation (−4%, i.e. hypothermia), flight success (−19%), and increase flight velocity (+13%). Because pesticide exposure and nutritional stress can co-occur, we suggest that future studies and pesticide risk assessments consider both seasonality and nutritional stress when evaluating pesticide safety for bees. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124408,237,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069743427&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2019.124408&partnerID=40&md5=e9e153582dd1b9217a112bdec38fbf6c,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,714

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013///,2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4,,,,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000346774000013,,0,,0,715

684,JOUR,Using the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,"['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

Here we apply these mixture models to investigate the potential to interpret the effects of semi-chronic binary mixture exposure for three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis within potentiation and mixture toxicity experiments. In the potentiation studies, the effect of the insecticide dimethoate with added propiconazole fungicide and neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin with added tau-fluvalinate pyrethroid acari-cide showed no difference in toxicity compared to the single chemical alone. Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of exposures to multiple chemicals, there is an urgent need to consider mixture effects in pollinator risk assessments. Our analyses suggest that current models, particularly those that utilise time-series data, such as DEBtox, can be used to identify additivity as the dominant response pattern and also those examples of interactions, even when small-scale, that may need to be taken into account during risk assessment. © 2017 Robinson et al.

Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient of a novel pesticide by the name of 'Sivanto', introduced by Bayer AG (Crop Science Division, Monheim am Rhein, Germany). It is recommended against sucking insects and marketed as 'harmless' to honeybees. Flupyradifurone binds to nicotinergic acetylcholine receptors like neonicotinoids, but it has a different mode of action. So far, little is known on how sublethal flupyradifurone doses affect honeybees. We chronically applied a sublethal and field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone to test for long-term effects on flight behaviour using radio-frequency identification. We examined haematoxylin/eosin-stained brains of flupyradifurone-treated bees to investigate possible changes in brain morphology and brain damage. A field-realistic flupyradifurone dose of approximately 1.0 mu g/bee/day significantly increased mortality. Pesticide-treated bees initiated foraging earlier than control bees. No morphological damage in the brain was observed. Synthesis and applications.

In case pesticide exposure to bees is likely, toxicity tests are performed with honey bees (Apis mellifera), with a tiered approach, for which validated and internationally accepted test protocols exist. However, concerns have grown regarding the protection of non-Apis bees [bumble bees (Bombus spp.), solitary and stingless bees], given their different life cycles and therefore distinct exposure routes. Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient. In addition, new insights needed to develop a standardized test protocol were acquired, such as testing of a positive control for the first time and selection of male and female individuals at egg level. © 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112143,215,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102581767&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112143&partnerID=40&md5=0b628199b435a536f1bf9d7479f980a8,Scopus,"['adult', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus (genus)', 'cocoon', 'cocoon weight', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'Cornuta', 'developmental mortality', 'dose-response relationship', 'drug effect', 'embryo', 'environment', 'exposure', 'female', 'Female', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'larval development time', 'Lethal endpoints', 'lethality', 'life cycle stage', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'longevity', 'male', 'Megachilidae', 'Meliponinae', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Oral test protocol', 'Osmia', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia cornuta', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'pollen provision consumption', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Solitary bee larvae', 'standardization', 'Sublethal endpoints', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity Tests', 'validation study', 'weight', 'winter']",,,,0,,0,721

Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

It has been demonstrated that low dosages of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid may affect honey bee, Apis mellifera L., behavior. In this article, the foraging behavior of the honey bee workers was investigated to show the effects of imidacloprid. By measuring the time interval between two visits at the same feeding site, we found that the normal foraging interval of honey bee workers was within 300s. However, these honey bee workers delayed their return visit for >300s when they were treated orally with sugar water containing imidacloprid. This time delay in their return visit is concentration-dependent, and the lowest effective concentration was found to be 50 /μg/liter. When bees were treated with an imidacloprid concentration higher than 1,200 /μg/liter, they showed abnormalities in revisiting the feeding site. Some of them went missing, and some were present again at the feeding site the next day. Returning bees also showed delay in their return trips.

During their lifetime bumblebees are regularly challenged by various environmental stressors including insecticides. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing, but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other eusocial or solitary bees. To investigate this, the susceptibility of B. terrestris to selected pesticides within the neonicotinoid, pyrethroid and organophosphate classes was examined using acute insecticide bioassays. Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acet-amiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds. The sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species. This finding highlights the need to consider each compound within an insecticide class in isolation rather than extrapolating between different insecticides in the same class or sharing the same mode of action.",2020/06//,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104562,166,,,,,,,0048-3575,WOS:000536197700006,,0,,0,724

Poor colony health or unusually high colony losses of managed honey bees result from a myriad of stressors, which are more harmful in combination. Climate change is expected to accentuate the effects of these stressors, but the physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees to elevated temperatures while under simultaneous influence of one or more stressors remain largely unknown. Here we test the hypothesis that exposure to acute, sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides reduce thermal tolerance in honey bees. We administered to bees oral doses of imidacloprid and acetamiprid at 1/5, 1/20, and 1/100 of LD50 and measured their heat tolerance 4 h post-feeding, using both dynamic and static protocols. Contrary to our expectations, acute exposure to sublethal doses of both insecticides resulted in higher thermal tolerance and greater survival rates of bees. Bees that ingested the higher doses of insecticides displayed a critical thermal maximum from 2 ̊C to 5 ̊C greater than that of the control group, and 67%–87% reduction in mortality. Our study suggests a resilience of honey bees to high temperatures when other stressors are present, which is consistent with studies in other insects. We discuss the implications of these results and hypothesize that this compensatory effect is likely due to induction of heat shock proteins by the insecticides, which provides temporary protection from elevated temperatures. © 2022 Gonzalez et al",2022///,2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0240950,17,02-Feb,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125415378&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0240950&partnerID=40&md5=62002621cbb1141c42864400df3a6956,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Pollination', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'survival rate', 'sublethal dose', 'short term exposure', 'high temperature', 'climate change', 'LD50', 'mortality rate', 'pilot study', 'physiological stress', 'heat shock protein', 'critical thermal maximum', 'heat tolerance', 'Climate Change', 'Thermotolerance']",,,,0,,0,725

However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.",2017/06/01/,2017,10.1002/jez.2087,327,5,273,283,,,,2471-5638,WOS:000412084100007,,0,,0,726

We investigated the susceptibility of Tetragonisca fiebrigi to sublethal concentrations of insecticides fipronil, malathion, and thiamethoxam (administered through contact and ingestion) by determining the LC50 values after 24 hours of exposure and analyzing changes in the activity of esterase isoenzymes and the chromatin in brain cells. The LC50 values showed that all three insecticides were highly toxic through contact and ingestion. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the relative EST-4 (carboxylesterase) activity in T. fiebrigi was partially inhibited by malathion and fipronil ingestion. Moreover, the EST-4 band intensity was increased following high-concentration thiamethoxam (contact) exposure, indicating the increased relative activity of this isoenzyme to detoxify the compound. In the cytochemical analysis of brain cells, the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) points for the control stingless bees and malathion ingestion-exposed and thiamethoxam-exposed (contact and ingestion) stingless bees were in the range of 0.20-0.30 M MgCl2, whereas that for malathion contact-exposed bees was 0.15 M MgCl2, indicating chromatin relaxation and suggesting an increase in gene expression.

We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 mu g/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 mu g/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 mu g/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls.

Increasing evidence suggests that sublethal toxicity of agricultural pesticides affects solitary bees differently than the social bees used to determine regulatory thresholds, such as honey bees and bumblebees. Studies on solitary bees are challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining large numbers of eggs or young larvae for bioassays. Here we show the toxic and sublethal developmental effects of four widely used plant systemic pesticides on the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons). Pollen food stores of this solitary bee were treated with different concentrations of three insecticides (acetamiprid, flonicamid, and sulfoxaflor) and a fungicide (dodine). Eggs were transplanted to the treated pollen and larvae were allowed to feed on the pollen stores after egg hatch. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated pollen were measured until adult eclosion. This year-long study revealed that chronic exposure to all tested pesticides delayed larval development and lowered larval and adult body weights. Additionally, exposure to the systemic fungicide resulted in abnormal larval defecation and increased mortality at the pupal stage, indicating potential risk to bees from fungicide exposure.

In this paper, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis to environmentally realistic levels of clothianidin (neonicotinoid insecticide) and propiconazole (fungicide), singly and in combination. The amount of feeding solution consumed was highest in bees exposed to the neonicotinoid, and lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Ovary maturation and longevity of bees of the neonicotinoid and the fungicide treatments did not differ from those of control bees. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed slow ovary maturation and decreased longevity. We found a synergistic interaction between the neonicotinoid and the fungicide on survival probability. We also found an interaction between treatment and emergence time (an indicator of physiological condition) on longevity. Longevity was negatively correlated to physiological condition only in the fungicide and the mixture treatments. Delayed ovary maturation and premature death imply a shortened nesting period (highly correlated to fecundity in Osmia).

Exposure to clothianidin significantly increased mortality in the three concentrations compared to controls. Interestingly, the lowest clothianidin concentration was associated with the highest mortality, and the medium concentration with the highest food intake. Exposure to clothianidin induced significant variation in the taxonomic distribution of gut microbiota activity. Co-abundance network analysis revealed local dysbiosis signatures specific to each gut section (midgut, ileum and rectum) were driven by specific taxa.

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTSThe field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONSThe present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture.

652,JOUR,Chronic exposure of bumblebees to neonicotinoid imidacloprid suppresses the entire mevalonate pathway and fatty acid synthesis,"['Erban, T', 'Sopko, B', 'Talacko, P', 'Harant, K', 'Kadlikova, K', 'Halesova, T', 'Riddellova, K', 'Pekas, A']",JOURNAL OF PROTEOMICS,"Determining the side effects of pesticides on pollinators is an important topic due to the increasing loss of pollinators. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid.

Consequently, honeybees may be exposed to these substances through distribution throughout plant tissues via the vascular system through several pathways, such as surface water, the exudates excreted from plants, and air pollution via drift of dust as well as contaminated pollen and nectar. In the current study, the single and combined toxicity of clothianidin, dinotefuran, and thiamethoxam to honeybees was examined after 48 h exposure by the acute oral method and combination index (CI)-isobologram equation. At the 48 h interval, our results showed that 1) the order of toxicities for the single insecticides was ranked as clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran and that 2) all binary and ternary combinations showed synergism or additive effect at the effect (fa) 0.5. Therefore, our results not only provided meaningful guidelines in evaluating the safety risk of the mixtures of the three neonicotinoids towards honeybees but also suggested that there is a significant interest in the study of mixture toxicities of neonicotinoids against honeybees because risk assessment of neonicotinoids against honeybees conducted only in individual insecticides may underestimate the realistic toxicity. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.06.045,184,,806,811,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020932175&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2017.06.045&partnerID=40&md5=8cc145d5135b142090e86f1031ee7bdb,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,737

But it can be disrupted by pesticides and in-hive chemicals, putting honey bee health in danger. We used a controlled and fully crossed laboratory experimental design to test the effects of a 10-day period of chronic exposure to field-realistic sublethal concentrations of two nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist insecticides (nACHRs), namely flupyradifurone (FPF) and sulfoxaflor (Sulf), and a fungicide, azoxystrobin (Azoxy), individually and in combination, on the survival of individual honey bee workers and the composition of their gut microbiota (fungal and bacterial diversity). Metabarcoding was used to examine the gut microbiota on days 0, 5, and 10 of pesticide exposure to determine how the microbial response varies over time; to do so, the fungal ITS2 fragment and the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA were targeted. We found that FPF has a negative impact on honey bee survival, but interactive (additive or synergistic) effects between either insecticide and the fungicide on honey bee survival were not statistically significant. Pesticide treatments significantly impacted the microbial community composition. The fungicide Azoxy substantially reduced the Shannon diversity of fungi after chronic exposure for 10 days. The relative abundance of the top 10 genera of the bee gut microbiota was also differentially affected by the fungicide, insecticides, and fungicide-insecticide combinations. Gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with an increase in the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens such as Serratia spp. (e.g. S. marcescens), which can have devastating consequences for host health such as increased susceptibility to infection and reduced lifespan. Our findings raise concerns about the long-term impact of novel nACHR insecticides, particularly FPF, on pollinator health and recommend a novel methodology for a refined risk assessment that includes the potential effects of agrochemicals on the gut microbiome of bees. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157941,849,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135966632&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157941&partnerID=40&md5=7c8c3760f1611476c8dee50665616ace,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'Pesticide', 'nicotinic receptor', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'adult', 'lifespan', 'pathogen', 'worker (insect)', 'Honey bee', 'Health risks', 'sublethal concentration', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'long term exposure', 'unclassified drug', 'agrochemical', 'Chronic exposure', 'Pollinator decline', 'animal tissue', 'nontarget organism', 'fungicide', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Synergistic effect', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'synergistic effect', 'population abundance', 'population decline', '4-Butyrolactone', 'flupyradifurone', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'Pyrimidines', 'intestine flora', 'RNA', 'microbiology', 'Azoxystrobin', 'microbial community', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'microbial diversity', 'RNA 16S', 'dysbiosis', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Pathogen', 'Microbiome', 'Pathogens', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'experimental design', 'Dysbiosis', 'Shannon index', 'Gut microbiota', 'Serratia marcescens', 'infectious agent', 'species composition', 'additive effect', 'bacterial RNA', 'DNA barcoding', 'genus', 'infection sensitivity', 'internal transcribed spacer 2', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist', 'relative abundance', 'Relative abundance', 'stomach content', 'yeast', 'Yeast']",,,,0,,0,738

Heat shock protein 70 and 90 genes were upregulated in bees exposed to the combined treatment compared to those exposed to each single treatment. Transcriptome analysis revealed that metabolic pathways remained intact in the high temperature treatment, whereas several metabolic pathways were altered by either the IMD treatment (downregulation of cellular respiration pathways) or the combined treatment (upregulation of protein synthesis and signaling pathways).

Furthermore, unlike honeybees, native pollinator species have received little attention. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the bioinsecticide spinosad were assessed in the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata, an important native pollinator in the Neotropical region. The adult stingless bee workers exhibited high oral insecticide susceptibility, with LD50s of 23.54 and 12.07ng a.i./bee for imidacloprid and spinosad, respectively. Imidacloprid also impaired worker respiration and overall group activity and flight, while spinosad significantly impaired only worker flight despite exhibiting higher oral toxicity to adult workers than imidacloprid. These findings indicate the hazardous nature not only of imidacloprid but also the bioinsecticide spinosad to adult workers of the native pollinator M. quadrifasciata.

No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology. © 2019 Coulon et al.

140,JOUR,RFID tracking of sublethal effects of two neonicotinoid insecticides on the foraging behavior of Apis mellifera,"['Schneider, C.W.', 'Tautz, J.', 'Grünewald, B.', 'Fuchs, S.']",PLoS ONE,"The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ≥0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ≥1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides. © 2012 Schneider et al.",2012///,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0030023,7,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855704065&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0030023&partnerID=40&md5=976863335c5907ddb11a286697266103,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,742

Various pesticides have threatened the abundance and diversity of bumblebees. In addition to direct sublethal effects, pesticides may alter the gut microbial communities of bees. Imidacloprid and flupyradifurone insecticides both bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, the latter was assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied to flowering crops. In this study, we assessed the impacts of these two pesticides on queenless microcolonies and the gut microbiota of Bombus terrestris. We found that 10 mu g/L imidacloprid significantly impeded syrup consumption, and post-poned the egg-laying period, larvae, and pupae development. It decreased the relative abundance of the bumblebee-specific symbionts, Apibacter and Lactobacillus Firm-5. On the contrary, 10 mu g/L flupyradifurone did not reduce syrup consumption, block larvae and pupae development in bumble-bees.

Interestingly, increased mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected bees after exposure to boscalid, with synergistic negative effects. Regarding gut microbiota composition, co-exposure to the parasite and each pesticide led to decreased abundance of Alphaproteobacteria, and increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria.

The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline. © 2022",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161331,868,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146540349&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.161331&partnerID=40&md5=a03515a9e14c5ba0807878b92627c4fd,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'nicotinic receptor', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'survival', 'Imidacloprids', 'sublethal dose', 'lifespan', 'Honey bee', 'gene expression', 'short term exposure', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'down regulation', 'long term exposure', 'unclassified drug', 'Weed control', 'protein expression', 'Sublethal dose', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'intestine flora', 'Non-target organism', 'bioaccumulation', 'glucose oxidase', 'Glucose', 'animal health', 'lysozyme', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'crop protection', 'nitrogen', 'Gut microbiota', 'Gut bacteria', 'Ammonia', 'ammonium', 'Glucose oxidase', 'Glucose sensors', 'glufosinate', 'Glufosinate', 'Glufosinate-ammonium', 'immunocompetence', 'Molecules', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'phosphinothricin']",,,,0,,0,745

The interaction between sublethal doses of a neurotoxin, clothianidin, and the ectoparasite, Varroa destructor, was examined by measuring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brains, deformed wing virus (DWV) and the proportion and intensity of self-grooming. Evidence for an interaction was observed between the stressors in a reduction in the proportion of intense groomers. Only the lowest dose of clothianidin alone reduced the proportion of self-groomers and increased DWV levels. V. destructor shared a higher proportion of DEGs with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin, indicating that the effects of V. destructor were more pervasive than those of clothianidin when they were combined. The number of up-regulated DEGs were reduced with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin alone, suggesting an interference with the impacts of clothianidin. Clothianidin and V. destructor affected DEGs from different biological pathways but shared impacts on pathways related to neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s, which could be related to neurological dysfunction and may explain their negative impacts on grooming.

631,JOUR,Insights into the degradation and toxicity difference mechanism of neonicotinoid pesticides in honeybees by mass spectrometry imaging,"['Zhang, Y', 'Chen, D', 'Du, MY', 'Ma, LL', 'Li, P', 'Qin, R', 'Yang, JR', 'Yin, ZB', 'Wu, XZ', 'Xu, HH']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Honeybees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and flowering plants, whereas they are confronting decline around the world due to the overuse of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids. The mechanism behind the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on honeybees has attracted considerable interest, yet it remains unknown due to the limited insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in honeybees. Herein, we demonstrated the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDIMSI) for the spatiotemporal visualization of neonicotinoids, such as N-nitroguanidine (dinotefuran) and Ncyanoamidine (acetamiprid) compounds, administered by oral application or direct contact, in the whole-body section of honeybees. The MSI results revealed that both dinotefuran and acetamiprid can quickly penetrate various biological barriers and distribute within the whole-body section of honeybees, but acetamiprid can be degraded much faster than dinotefuran. The degradation rate of acetamiprid is significantly decreased when piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is applied, whereas that of dinotefuran remains almost unchanged. These two factors might contribute to the fact that dinotefuran affords a higher toxicity to honeybees than acetamiprid. Moreover, the toxicity and degradation rate of acetamiprid can be affected by co-application with tebuconazole. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the discrepant toxicity between dinotefuran and acetamiprid does not lie in the difference in their of various barriers of but in the degradation rate of neonicotinoid pesticides within honeybee tissues. Moreover, new perspectives are given to better understand the causes of the current decline in honeybee populations posed by insecticides, providing guidelines for the precise use of conventional agrochemicals and the rational design of novel pesticide candidates.

99,JOUR,Real-time monitoring of honeybee colony daily activity and bee loss rates can highlight the risk posed by a pesticide,"['Barascou, L.', 'Godeau, U.', 'Pioz, M.', 'Martin, O.', 'Sené, D.', 'Crauser, D.', 'Le Conte, Y.', 'Alaux, C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Information on honeybee foraging performance and especially bee loss rates at the colony level are crucial for evaluating the magnitude of effects due to pesticide exposure, thereby ensuring that protection goals for honeybee colonies are met (i.e. threshold of acceptable effects). However, current methods for monitoring honeybee foraging activity and mortality are very approximate (visual records) or are time-limited and mostly based on single cohort analysis. We therefore assess the potential of bee counters, that enable a colony-level and continuous monitoring of bee flight activity and mortality, in pesticide risk assessment. After assessing the background activity and bee loss rates, we exposed colonies to two concentrations of sulfoxaflor (a neurotoxic insecticide) in sugar syrup: a concentration that was considered to be field realistic (0.59 μg/ml) and a higher concentration (2.36 μg/ml) representing a worst-case exposure scenario. We did not find any effect of the field-realistic concentration on flight activity and bee loss rates. However, a two-fold decrease in daily flight activity and a 10-fold increase in daily bee losses were detected in colonies exposed to the highest sulfoxaflor concentration as compared to before exposure. When compared to the theoretical trigger values associated with the specific protection goal of 7 % colony-size reduction, the observed fold changes in daily bee losses were often found to be at risk for colonies. In conclusion, the real-time and colony-level monitoring of bee loss rates, combined with threshold values indicating at which levels bee loss rates threaten the colony, have great potential for improving regulatory pesticide risk assessments for honeybees under field conditions. © 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163928,886,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158044301&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163928&partnerID=40&md5=a069348fa254c4e8d76ca126a1d9d753,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee counter', 'Bees', 'chemical pollutant', 'colony', 'daily life activity', 'field study', 'Flight activity', 'Foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee colonies', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Loss rates', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'Mortality rate', 'Mortality rates', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'Population statistics', 'Protection goals', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'real time', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Specific protection goal', 'sucrose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'toxin', 'unclassified drug']",,,,0,,0,748

A strong immune defence is vital for the fitness of bees. However, the immune system can be weakened by environmental factors that may render bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid can severely affect the immunocompetence of Osmia bicornis. In detail, males exposed to thiacloprid solutions of 200 and 555 µg/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence - the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph - were impaired in males. In females, however, only a concentration of 555 µg/kg elicited similar immunosuppressive effects. Although males are smaller than females, they consumed more food solution. This leads to a 2.77 times higher exposure in males, probably explaining the different concentration thresholds observed between the sexes. In contrast to honeybees, dietary exposure to thiacloprid did not affect melanisation or wound healing in O. bicornis. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of O. bicornis, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-61445-w,10,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081579236&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-61445-w&partnerID=40&md5=27c64e7d725c3d59e59115314a2723b7,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'female', 'drug effect', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'male', 'thiacloprid', 'Male', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Female', 'hemolymph', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'immunology', 'blood cell', 'cell count', 'Cell Count', 'Hemocytes', 'Hemolymph', 'immunosuppressive agent', 'Immunosuppressive Agents']",,,,0,,0,749

However, limited information is available on the pesticide effects on solitary bees, especially in Neotropical countries. In this scenario, this study evaluated the survival and histopathological effects caused by the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/μL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/μL) in the midgut and parietal fat body of the solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male newly-emerged bees were orally exposed for 48 h to the pesticides, or alone or in combination, under laboratory conditions. The exposure to the insecticide reduced the survival of males, while the mixture reduced survival in both sexes. Acetamiprid promoted a reduction in the number of regenerative nests in the midgut, alterations of fat body cells by increasing carbohydrates in trophocytes, and reduction of oenocyte size, and increased the frequency of pericardial cells in the advanced activity stage. Both pesticides caused changes in HSP70 immunolabelling of midgut from males at the end of pesticide exposure. Comparatively, the effects on males were stronger than in females exposed to the same pesticides. Therefore, acetamiprid alone and in mixture with fungicide azoxystrobin can be harmful to males and females of Neotropical solitary bee C. analis showing lethal and sublethal effects at a concentration likely to be found in the environment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124712,360,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201012084&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124712&partnerID=40&md5=473fb0290f046c3ad77add42df7197ea,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'Pesticide', 'survival', 'adult', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'midgut', 'Survival', 'antibody labeling', 'Fat body', 'fungicide', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'histopathology', 'Pyrimidines', 'fat pad', 'chemical pollutant', 'Azoxystrobin', 'RNA interference', '% reductions', 'sex difference', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'fertility', 'aubergine', 'cell adhesion', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP', 'gender', 'Hsp70', 'Limited information', 'Malpighiales', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid']",,,,0,,0,750

However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/jemt.22339,77,4,274,281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896317005&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22339&partnerID=40&md5=52d578be248c256349e4f0308aa95ff2,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,751

Declines in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for synergistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure (-50%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors reduced also food consumption (-48%) and haemolymph levels of glucose (-60%) and trehalose (-27%). Our results provide the first demonstration that field-realistic nutritional stress and pesticide exposure can synergistically interact and cause significant harm to animal survival.

We hypothesized that octopamine (OA), with important functions in reward signaling and learning, can improve the behavior of honey bees under chemical stress. Memory retention and sucrose responsiveness were evaluated using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. The one-day-old bees were exposed separately to diazinon, imidacloprid, paraquat, manganese, and thymol at concentrations of 0.22, 29.04, 55.69, 106.19, and 0.91 ppm, respectively. On the 21st day of exposure, the bees’ responses to memory retention and sucrose responsiveness experiments were recorded after the training trial. In addition, PERs were recorded after OA injection. During the intervals, honey bees were exposed to the toxins topically. The expression levels of OA receptor genes, AmoctαR1 and AmoctβR4, were measured. The sucrose responsiveness tests showed no significant differences between the bees stimulated with the control solutions or toxins. Moreover, our results indicated that memory retention significantly declined in honey bees exposed to toxins compared to the controls (P≤0.05). According to the findings, OA improved the memory retention of honey bees exposed to toxins (P≤0.05). The expression levels of AmoctαR1 and AmoctβR4 genes significantly increased in the treated honey bees, especially those exposed to paraquat and manganese, after 30 min post-OA injection. It can be concluded that under chemical stress, OA administration encouraged honey bees to respond to a stimulus. Therefore, it can be added to a nutrient-enriched diet. © 2023 International Bee Research Association.",2024///,2024,10.1080/00218839.2023.2186018,63,1,76,87,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149593072&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2023.2186018&partnerID=40&md5=0cbe6701fc048181a60c286beca57080,Scopus,"['brain', 'proboscis extension reflex', 'Apis mellifera meda', 'behavioral learning', 'biogenic amine', 'memory retention']",,,,0,,0,753
773,JOUR,Modeling disruption of Apis mellifera (honey bee) odorant-binding protein function with high-affinity binders,"['Mayack, BK']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION,"Chemical toxins pose a great threat to honey bee health because they affect memory and cognition, diminish immunity, and increase susceptibility to infection, resulting in decreased colony performance, reproduction, and survival. Although the behavioral effects of sub-lethal chemical exposure on honey bees have been intensively studied, how xenobiotics affect olfaction, at the molecular level, still needs to be elucidated. In the present work, in silico tools, such as molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict if environmental chemicals have stronger binding affinities to honey bee antennal odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) than the representative floral odors citralva, eugenol, and the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine. Based on structural analysis, 21 chemicals from crop pesticides, household appliances, cosmetics, food, public health-related products, and other sources, many of which are pervasive in the hive environment, have higher binding affinities than the floral odors. These results suggest that chemical exposures are likely to interfere with the honey bee's sense of smell and this disruptive mechanism may be responsible for the lower associative learning and memory based on olfaction found in bees exposed to pesticides. Moreover, bees mainly rely on olfactory cues to perceive their environment and orient themselves as well as to discriminate and identify their food, predators, nestmates, and diseased individuals that need to be removed with hygienic behavior. In summary, sub-lethal exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to colony collapse in several ways from the disruption of proper olfaction functioning.",2023/05//,2023,10.1002/jmr.3008,36,5,,,,,,0952-3499,WOS:000943001100001,,0,,0,754

Honeybee colonies were randomly split on four different agricultural cornfield areas located near Quebec City, Canada. Two locations contained cornfields treated with a seed-coated systemic neonicotinoid insecticide while the two others were organic cornfields used as control treatments. Hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of two years. Honeybee viruses (brood queen cell virus BQCV, deformed wing virus DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus IAPV) and the brain specific expression of a biomarker of host physiological stress, the Acetylcholinesterase gene AChE, were investigated using RT-qPCR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed to detect pesticide residues in adult bees, honey, pollen, and corn flowers collected from the studied hives in each location. In addition, general hive conditions were assessed by monitoring colony weight and brood development. Neonicotinoids were only identified in corn flowers at low concentrations. However, honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid treated cornfields expressed significantly higher pathogen infection than those located in untreated cornfields. AChE levels showed elevated levels among honeybees that collected corn pollen from treated fields. Positive correlations were recorded between pathogens and the treated locations.

Honey bee larvae can be exposed to pesticides in contaminated nectar, pollen and wax. Due to the difficulties of rearing larvae in vitro, research focusing on adult bee exposure to pesticides is more common than that on larva exposure to pesticides. Herein, we aimed to assess the acute toxicity of five insecticides to honey bee larvae using an improved in vitro rearing method. RESULTS: LC50 and LD50 were calculated for larvae at 72 h following a single diet exposure administered when the larvae were 84 ± 12 h old. Solvent control larval mortalities were less than 15% at 72 h. The LC50 values (mg L−1) for each tested pesticide were as follows: amitraz, 494.27; chlorpyrifos, 15.39; coumaphos, 90.01; fluvalinate, 27.69; and imidacloprid, 138.84. The LD50 values in µg per larva were 14.83 (amitraz), 0.46 (chlorpyrifos), 2.70 (coumaphos), 0.83 (fluvalinate) and 4.17 (imidacloprid).

Exposure to pesticides or infection by parasites may cause subtle but ecologically important changes in cognitive functions of pollinators. The potential interactive effects of these stressors on learning and memory have not yet been explored. Furthermore, sensitivity to stressors may differ between species, but few studies have compared responses in different species. Here, we show that chronic exposure to field realistic levels of the neonicotinoid clothianidin impaired olfactory learning acquisition in honeybees, leading to potential impacts on colony fitness, but not in bumblebees. Infection by the microsporidian parasite Nosema ceranae slightly impaired learning in honeybees, but no interactive effects were observed. Nosema did not infect bumblebees (3% infection success). Nevertheless, Nosema-treated bumblebees had a slightly lower rate of learning than controls, but faster learning in combination with neonicotinoid exposure. This highlights the potential for complex interactive effects of stressors on learning. Our results underline that one cannot readily extrapolate findings from one bee species to others.

Nosema ceranae infection increased the abundance of Proteus mirabilis, Frischella perrara, and Gilliamella apicola and reduced the abundance of Bifidobacterium asteroides, Fructobacillus fructosus, and Lactobacillus spp. Supplementation with P. acidilactici overturned some of these alterations, bringing back the abundance of some altered species close to the relative abundance found in the controls. Surprisingly, the exposure to thiamethoxam also restored the relative abundance of some species modulated by N. ceranae. This study shows that stressors and probiotics may have an antagonistic impact on honey bee gut bacterial communities and that P. acidilactici may have a protective effect against the dysbiosis induced by an infection with N. ceranae. © 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/microorganisms12010192,12,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183362401&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms12010192&partnerID=40&md5=b7183cb61001ed64986f92da0709fe0f,Scopus,"['neonicotinoid', 'Apis mellifera', 'pollinators', 'gut microbiota', 'microsporidia', 'probiotic']",,,,0,,0,761
346,JOUR,Various routes of formulated insecticide mixture whole-body acute contact toxicity to honey bees (Apis mellifera),"['Belsky, J.', 'Biddinger, D.J.', 'Seiter, N.', 'Joshi, N.K.']",Environmental Challenges,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) are crucial pollinators, however large overwinter losses of managed hives and declines in feral colonies have occurred since 2006. Increased insecticide use and the introduction of new insecticide classes have been proposed as factors contributing to these declines. Previous studies have demonstrated contact toxicity of single active ingredient insecticides to honey bees. However, the field realistic contact toxicity of formulated (pre-mix) insecticide mixtures containing multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to honey bees has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we simulate whole body contact to spray applications made at low label recommended field rates of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram to honey bees under three realistic scenarios in field crops: (1) continuous exposure, (2) spray-only exposure, and (3) residual exposure. A customized spray tower in a laboratory setting was used to apply insecticides at the lowest recommended dose in the Environmental Protection Agency regulated label of each insecticide. Acute toxicity was determined by screening resulting mortality up to 96-hours post treatment. Mortality varied significantly between treatments at all evaluation periods for all experiments except residual exposure. For continuous and spray-only exposure, thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin resulted in 80–90% mortality at 48-hours, while at 96-hours we observed close to complete mortality for all treatments. This difference in mortality onset between treatments highlights the importance of extended observation beyond the 48-hours recommended by the USDA-EPA. Our finding of overall high mortality demonstrates the importance of comparing both combined and individual active ingredients in determining insecticide risk to honey bees. © 2021 The Author(s)",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envc.2021.100408,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121971627&doi=10.1016%2fj.envc.2021.100408&partnerID=40&md5=307e0fa6bd4fd2981a4bd75f8f1aa83c,Scopus,"['Neonicotinoids', 'Honey bees', 'Toxicity', 'Pyrethroids', 'Premix insecticides', 'Residual toxicity']",,,,0,,0,762

Many studies showed that neonicotinoid pesticides harm honeybee learning and farming activities, negatively affect colony adaptation and reduce pollination abilities. Bumblebees are heavily preferred species all over the world in order to ensure pollination in plant production. In this study, sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the brain of Bombus terrestris workers were analyzed. Suspensions (1/1000, 1/100, 1/10) of the maximum recommended dose of thiamethoxam were applied to the workers. 48 h after spraying, morphological effects on the brains of workers were studied. According to area measurements of ICC's of Kenyon cells, there was a significant difference between 1/10 dose and all groups. On the other hand, areas of INC's of Kenyon cells showed a significant difference between the control group and all dose groups. Neuropil disorganization in the calyces increased gradually and differed significantly between the groups and was mostly detected at the highest dose (1/10). Apart from optic lobes, pycnotic nuclei were also observed in the middle region of calyces of mushroom bodies in the high dose group. Also, the width of the lamina, medulla and lobula parts of the optic lobes of each group and the areas of the antennal lobes were measured and significant differences were determined between the groups.

Evaluating the exposure and responses of different bee species to plant protection products is considered an essential part of their risk assessment. This study was conducted to assess the impacts of thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) in a worst-case scenario under semi-field conditions. Bumblebee colonies or solitary bee trap nests were confined in tunnels with flowering oilseed rape. The recommended maximum application rates of 72 g thiacloprid/ha and 675 g prochloraz/ha were applied as a tank mixture during bee flight in full flowering oilseed rape. Several parameters such as flight and foraging activity, population parameters, and exposure level were investigated. Our results show adverse effects of the combination of thiacloprid and prochloraz on the reproductive performance of red mason bees. The number of cocoons produced by O. bicornis was significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the control group. Regarding bumblebees, we found no effects of the thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on any observed parameters of colony development. The maximum detected concentrations of both active substances three days after application were higher in O. bicornis pollen mass compared to B. terrestris stored pollen. We conclude that this worst-case scenario of thiacloprid-prochloraz exposure poses a high risk to solitary bees and thus the use of such mixture should be restricted. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1007/s10646-020-02223-2,29,7,846,855,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084840541&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-020-02223-2&partnerID=40&md5=0f41b208fd9e7ef5177bd48f7e906318,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'flight behavior', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'risk assessment', 'Apoidea', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'flying', 'flight', 'comparative study', 'organism colony', 'reproduction', 'colony', 'priority journal', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'thiacloprid', 'Bumblebees', 'Reproduction', 'Thiacloprid', 'Flight, Animal', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Osmia', 'population dynamics', 'Population Dynamics', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'rapeseed', 'species difference', 'Brassica napus', 'prochloraz', 'Germany', 'cocoon', 'Exposure', 'reproductive toxicity', 'interspecific variation', 'Osmia rufa', 'Prochloraz', 'Red mason bees']",,,,0,,0,764
201,JOUR,Honey Bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Decrease Foraging but Not Recruitment after Neonicotinoid Exposure,"['Ohlinger, B.D.', 'Schürch, R.', 'Durzi, S.', 'Kietzman, P.M.', 'Silliman, M.R.', 'Couvillon, M.J.']",Journal of Insect Science,"Honey bees (Linnaeus, Hymenoptera: Apidae) are widely used as commercial pollinators and commonly forage in agricultural and urban landscapes containing neonicotinoid-treated plants. Previous research has demonstrated that honey bees display adverse behavioral and cognitive effects after treatment with sublethal doses of neonicotinoids. In laboratory studies, honey bees simultaneously increase their proportional intake of neonicotinoid-treated solutions and decrease their total solution consumption to some concentrations of certain neonicotinoids. These findings suggest that neonicotinoids might elicit a suboptimal response in honey bees, in which they forage preferentially on foods containing pesticides, effectively increasing their exposure, while also decreasing their total food intake; however, behavioral responses in semifield and field conditions are less understood. Here we conducted a feeder experiment with freely flying bees to determine the effects of a sublethal, field-realistic concentration of imidacloprid (IMD) on the foraging and recruitment behaviors of honey bees visiting either a control feeder containing a sucrose solution or a treatment feeder containing the same sucrose solution with IMD. We report that IMD-treated honey bees foraged less frequently (-28%) and persistently (-66%) than control foragers. Recruitment behaviors (dance frequency and dance propensity) also decreased with IMD, but nonsignificantly. Our results suggest that neonicotinoids inhibit honey bee foraging, which could potentially decrease food intake and adversely affect colony health. © 2022 The Author(s).

Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context.

Recently, interactive effects of multiple agrochemicals on bees have been highlighted, including fungicides, which increase toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we use a semi-field study across two seasons in controlled foraging tunnels to test the effects of a field application of a commercial fungicide product with two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin and metconazole) applied at label rates. We also examine its interactive effects with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, at a conservative field-realistic dose of 2.23 ppb, on 48 honey bee colonies. We found combined effects of pesticide exposure, including additive 2.93-fold increases in mortality, and an additional effect of increased infestation levels of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Pesticide treatments also reduced colony activity, reduced colony weight, and increased sugar consumption of whole colonies. These findings indicate that typical sublethal exposure levels to common, co-occurring agrochemicals in the field significantly affect the health of whole honey bee colonies, highlighting an unintended consequence of increasing pesticide applications. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29886,10,9,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85190957678&doi=10.1016%2fj.heliyon.2024.e29886&partnerID=40&md5=e6d947082f3cd4336d566c75f9833088,Scopus,"['Fungicide', 'Honey bee', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Pesticide', 'Pollinator']",,,,0,,0,767
473,JOUR,Biphasic concentration-dependent interaction between imidacloprid and dietary phytochemicals in honey bees (Apis mellifera),"['Wong, M.J.', 'Liao, L.-H.', 'Berenbaum, M.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Background The presence of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in nectar, honey, pollen, beebread and beeswax has been implicated in declines worldwide in the health of the western honey bee Apis mellifera. Certain phytochemicals, including quercetin and p-coumaric acid, are ubiquitous in the honey bee diet and are known to upregulate cytochrome P450 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify insecticides. Thus, the possibility exists that these dietary phytochemicals interact with ingested imidacloprid to ameliorate toxicity by enhancing its detoxification. Approach Quercetin and p-coumaric acid were incorporated in a phytochemical-free artificial diet individually and together along with imidacloprid at a range of field-realistic concentrations. In acute toxicity bioassays, honey bee 24-and 48-hour imidacloprid LC50 values were determined in the presence of the phytochemicals. Additionally, chronic toxicity bioassays were conducted using varying concentrations of imidacloprid in diets with the phytochemicals to test impacts of phytochemicals on longevity. Results In acute toxicity bioassays, the phytochemicals had no effect on imidacloprid LC50 values. In chronic toxicity longevity bioassays, phytochemicals enhanced honey bee survival at low imidacloprid concentrations (15 and 45 ppb) but had a negative effect at higher concentrations (105 ppb and 135 ppb). p-Coumaric acid alone increased honey bee longevity at concentrations of 15 and 45 ppb imidacloprid (hazard ratio (HR): 0.83 and 0.70, respectively). Quercetin alone and in combination with p-coumaric acid similarly enhanced longevity at 45 ppb imidacloprid (HR:0.81 and HR:0.77, respectively). However, p-coumaric acid in combination with 105 ppb imidacloprid and quercetin in combination with 135 ppb imidacloprid increased honey bee HR by approximately 30% (HR:1.33 and HR:1.30, respectively). Conclusions The biphasic concentration-dependent response of honey bees to imidacloprid in the presence of two ubiquitous dietary phytochemicals indicates that there are limits to the protective effects of the natural diet of honey bees against neonicotinoids based on their own inherent toxicity. © 2018 Wong et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",2018///,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0206625,13,11,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055913454&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0206625&partnerID=40&md5=6bc8adf41daeac66b0b0bc0638b06f71,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,768

Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-κB immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-κB activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-κB signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals. Furthermore, this study has implications for the conservation of bees, as it will contribute to the definition of more appropriate guidelines for testing chronic or sublethal effects of pesticides used in agriculture.",2013///,2013,10.1073/pnas.1314923110,110,46,18466,18471,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84887424712&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1314923110&partnerID=40&md5=61f0efc822ad747267dd241f92766f0f,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,770

Two studies have assessed potential lethal and sublethal effects in young bees fed with CCRI41 cotton pollen but no effect was observed on learning capacities, although lower feeding activity in exposed honey bees was noted (antifeedant effect). The present study aimed at providing further insights into potential side effects of CCRI41 cotton on honey bees. Emerging honey bees were exposed to different pollen diets using no-choice feeding protocols (chronic exposure) in controlled laboratory conditions and we aimed at documenting potential mechanisms underneath the CCRI41 antifeedant effect previously reported. Activity of midgut proteolytic enzyme of young adult honey bees fed on CCRI41 cotton pollen were not significantly affected, i.e. previously observed antifeedant effect was not linked to disturbed activity of the proteolytic enzymes in bees' midgut. Hypopharyngeal gland development was assessed by quantifying total extractable proteins from the glands. Results suggested that CCRI41 cotton pollen carries no risk to hypopharyngeal gland development of young adult honey bees. In the two bioassays, honey bees exposed to 1 % soybean trypsin inhibitor were used as positive controls for both midgut proteolytic enzymes and hypopharyngeal gland proteins quantification, and bees exposed to 48 ppb (part per billion) (i.e. 48 ng g -1) imidacloprid were used as controls for exposure to a sublethal concentration of toxic product. The results show that the previously reported antifeedant effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees is not linked to effects on their midgut proteolytic enzymes or on the development of their hypopharyngeal glands.

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

528,JOUR,Surrogate species in pesticide risk assessments: Toxicological data of three stingless bees species,"['Lourencetti, A.P.S.', 'Azevedo, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Environmental Pollution,"Discussions about environmental risk reassessment of pesticides have grown in the last decades, especially in tropical and subtropical regions since the diversity of bee species in these places is quite different. Stingless bees are highly affected by pesticides, and toxicity information is necessary to include them in the regulatory process of countries that hosts a diversity of these species. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50), estimate the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) and compared the sensitivity of three species of stingless bees exposed to the commercial formulation of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TMX). The LD50 was estimated based on the LC50 determined in the present study (LC50 = 0.329 ng a.i./μL for Tetragonisca angustula; 0.624 ng a.i./μL for Scaptotrigona postica, and 0.215 ng a.i./μL for Melipona scutellaris). Considering these data, toxicity endpoints were used to fit species sensitive distribution curves (SSD) and determine the sensitivity ratio. The results showed that all the stingless bees tested are more sensitive to TMX than the Apis mellifera, the model organism used in ecotoxicological tests. Regarding the oral LC50, the most susceptible and most tolerant species were M. scutellaris > T. angustula > S. postica > A. mellifera. Following the same evaluated pattern, for the LD50 (considering the weight of the bees - ng a.i./g bee), we have: M. scutellaris > S. postica > T. angustula > A. mellifera, and without the weight considered (ng a.i./bee): T. angustula > M. scutellaris > S. postica > A. mellifera. The different sensitivities among stingless bee species highlight the importance of inserting more than one surrogate species with a variety of sizes in research and protocol development. Additionally, the research suggests the need to investigate patterns regarding the influence of body mass on pesticide sensitivity among stingless bee species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120842,318,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144079658&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2022.120842&partnerID=40&md5=76784e21ad6b201448cabf3e1b119948,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'thiamethoxam', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'stingless bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'toxicology', 'body mass', 'body weight', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'LC50', 'sensitivity analysis', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'species difference', 'Tropics', 'Body weight', 'Melipona scutellaris', 'Tetragonisca angustula', 'Environmental risks', 'species sensitivity distribution', 'Tropical regions', 'Population distribution', 'sensitivity ratio', 'species', 'Species sensitivity distribution', 'Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD)', 'Species sensitivity distributions', 'surrogate species']",,,,0,,0,775

However, in recent years, the number of honeybee colonies is diminishing rapidly, which is probably linked to the wide use of neonicotinoid insecticides. Middle-aged honeybees were fed with 50% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg/L thiacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) for up to 13 days, and on each day of exposure experiment, percentage survival, sucrose consumption, and bodyweight of honeybees were measured. Further, changes in honeybee gut microbial community were examined using next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on day 1, 7, and 13 of the exposure. When compared to control-treatment, continuous exposure to high (0.6 mg/L) and very high (2.0 mg/L) concentrations of thiacloprid significantly reduced percentage survival of honeybees (p < 0.001) and led to dysbiosis of their gut microbial community on day 7 of the exposure. However, during subsequent developmental stages of middle-aged honeybees (i.e. on day 13), their gut microbiome recovered from dysbiosis that occurred previously due to thiacloprid exposure.

Several causes such as land-use change and agricultural intensification are reported to be the main drivers of the decline. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of land use on honey bee and stingless bee populations. Research was conducted in Bogor and Malang to compare between two different geographical areas. Managed bees such as honey bees (Apis cerana and A. mellifera) and stingless bees (Tetragonula laeviceps) were investigated to examine the effect of agricultural intensification. Field experiments were conducted by placing beehives in selected habitats (i.e., beekeeper gardens, forests areas, and agriculture areas). Population growth and neonicotinoid residue analysis of bees in different hive locations were measured to study the effect of habitat type. Population growth of bees represents the forager abundance and colony weight. Based on the analysis, we found that habitat type affected forager abundance and colony weight of honey bees (p < 0.05), although the patterns were different between species, region, as well as season.

Results showed that stingless bees were more susceptible to insecticides than honeybees. The commercial fungicides thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil caused low mortality, regardless of concentration; however, their combination was as toxic as imidacloprid to both species, and over 400-fold more toxic than deltamethrin for A. mellifera. There were highly synergistic effects on mortality caused by interactions in the mixture of imidacloprid and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl, chlorothalonil and the combined fungicide formulation in A. mellifera, and also to a lesser extent in P. helleri.

705,JOUR,Honey bee foraging ability suppressed by imidacloprid can be ameliorated by adding adenosine,"['Lin, Y.-C.', 'Lu, Y.-H.', 'Tang, C.-K.', 'Yang, E.-C.', 'Wu, Y.-L.']",Environmental Pollution,"Honey bees are important pollinators in most ecosystem, but they are currently facing many threats, which have led to a reduction in their population. Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid pesticide can impair the memory and learning ability of honey bees, which can eventually lead to a decline in their foraging and homing abilities. In this study, we investigated the homing ability barrier from the perspective of energy supply. We believe that when worker bees experience stress, their energy supply may shift from pro-movement to pro-resistance; this will lead to inadequate energy provision to the flight muscles, causing a reduction in wingbeat frequency and impairing the flight ability of the worker bees. To test this, the worker bees were treated with imidacloprid, and wing beats between the treatment groups were compared. Their glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and ATP contents were also measured, and their genes for energy metabolism and resistance were analyzed. The addition of adenosine improved the ATP content and helped recover the wingbeat frequency of the worker bees. The preliminary results obtained showed that wingbeat frequency and glucose content in the worker bees treated with imidacloprid were significantly lower than those in the control group. This result is consistent with our hypothesis and demonstrates that energy supply imbalances can prevent worker bees from returning to their hives. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121920,332,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161702033&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.121920&partnerID=40&md5=e996b704d7601d0d98dc2e1b6f1c5c73,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal behavior', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'honeybee', 'flight', 'Food products', 'Imidacloprids', 'comparative study', 'Apidae', 'Honey bees', 'Honey bee', 'homing behavior', 'Imidacloprid', ""Workers'"", 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'experimental study', 'metabolism', 'frequency analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'physiological response', 'physiological stress', '% reductions', 'Metabolism', 'adenosine', 'Adenosine', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'ATP content', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'energy resource', 'Energy resources', 'Energy supplies', 'flight muscle', 'glucose', 'Glucose', 'Glucose content', 'glycogen', 'remediation', 'trehalose', 'wing', 'wingbeat frequency', 'Wingbeat frequency', 'worker bee']",,,,0,,0,780

165,JOUR,Impaired associative learning after chronic exposure to pesticides in young adult honey bees,"['Gonalons, C.M.', 'Farina, W.M.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoids are the most widespread insecticides in agriculture, preferred for their low toxicity to mammals and their systemic nature. Nevertheless, there have been increasing concerns regarding their impact on non-target organisms. Glyphosate is also widely used in crops and, therefore, traces of this pesticide are likely to be found together with neonicotinoids. Although glyphosate is considered a herbicide, adverse effects have been found on animal species, including honey bees. Apis mellifera is one of the most important pollinators in agroecosystems and is exposed to both these pesticides. Traces can be found in nectar and pollen of flowers that honey bees visit, but also in honey stores inside the hive. Young workers, which perform in-hive tasks that are crucial for colony maintenance, are potentially exposed to both these contaminated resources. These workers present high plasticity and are susceptible to stimuli that can modulate their behaviour and impact on colony state. Therefore, by performing standardised assays to study sublethal effects of these pesticides, these bees can be used as bioindicators. We studied the effect of chronic joint exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and glyphosate on gustatory perception and olfactory learning. Both pesticides reduced sucrose responsiveness and had a negative effect on olfactory learning. Glyphosate also reduced food uptake during rearing. The results indicate differential susceptibility according to honey bee age. The two agrochemicals had adverse effects on different aspects of honey bee appetitive behaviour, which could have repercussions for food distribution, propagation of olfactory information and task coordination within the nest. © 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.",2018///,2018,10.1242/jeb.176644,221,7,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045350300&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.176644&partnerID=40&md5=e57097603f1fcd42ba06cc7571845ede,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,782

247,JOUR,Sensitivity of Buff-Tailed Bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) to Insecticides with Different Mode of Action,"['Cabezas, G.', 'Farinós, G.P.']",Insects,"Systemic insecticides are recognized as one of the drivers of the worldwide bee decline as they are exposed to them through multiple pathways. Specifically, neonicotinoids, some of which are banned for outdoor use in the European Union (EU), have been pointed out as a major cause of bee collapse. Thus, farmers have had to look for alternatives for pest control and use known insecticides or new substances reportedly less harmful to bees. We evaluated the oral acute toxicity of six insecticides (three of them systemic: imidacloprid, thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor) with four different modes of action on buff-tailed bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris): two banned neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid), two pyrethroids (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate), one sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) and a microbial insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, present in genetically modified (Bt) maize. The microbial insecticide only caused mortality to bumblebee workers at extremely high concentrations, so it is expected that Bt maize does not pose a risk to them. The toxicity of the other five insecticides on bumblebees was, from highest to lowest: imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and thiacloprid.

177,JOUR,Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Matsumoto, T.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid.",2013///,2013,,66,1,1,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877647374&partnerID=40&md5=3cd1d9f5b223c005f59c51d378ee1e27,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,786

TMX and other neonicotinoids are reported to be potential causes of honey bee decline. Due to its systematic action, TMX may be recovered in pollen, bee bread, nectar, and honey, which make bees likely to be exposed to contaminated diet. In this study, we used immunolabeling to demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of TMX decrease the protein levels of synapsin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the antennal lobes (ALs) of pupae and newly emerged worker bees that were exposed through the food to TMX during the larval phase. A decrease in the synapsin level was observed in the MBs of pupae previously exposed to 0.001 and 1.44 ng/µL and in newly emerged bees previously exposed to 1.44 ng/µL and no changes were observed in the optical lobes (OLs). In the ALs, the decrease was observed in pupae and newly emerged bees exposed to 1.44 ng/µL. Because the MBs and ALs are brain structures involved in stimuli reception, learning, and memory consolidation and because synapsin is important for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we hypothesize that exposure to sublethal concentrations of TMX during the larval stage may cause neurophysiological disorders in honey bees. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.048,169,,523,528,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056819414&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.11.048&partnerID=40&md5=b2de92bf068a1cbab18fb4514594a35a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,787

Changes in the immune response may hinder insects more susceptible to diseases and increase the risk of pathogen infection and pest resistance. We found that imidacloprid and amitraz alter the oxidative response of insect hemocytes at different concentrations of the immune stimulator, zymosan A. There is a differential effect of imidacloprid and amitraz on hemocytes of insects from different orders and their effect on oxidative response in insects persists beyond the point of early contact with zymosan A. Invertebrates have a diverse immune system that responds differently to stressors such as pesticides and pathogens, which leads to different degrees of susceptibility. Honeybees are facing a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder which is attributed to several factors including pesticides and pathogens. We applied an in vitro approach to assess the response of immune-activated hemocytes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Mamestra brassicae after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz. Hemocytes were exposed to the pesticides in single and co-exposures using zymosan A for immune activation. We measured the effect of these exposures on cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production from 15 to 120 min and on extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production after 3 h to assess potential alterations in the oxidative response. Our results indicate that NO and H2O2 production is more altered in honeybee hemocytes compared to D. melanogaster and M. brassicae cell lines. There is also a differential production at different time points after pesticide exposure between these insect species as contrasting effects were evident with the oxidative responses in hemocytes. The results imply that imidacloprid and amitraz act differently on the immune response among insect orders and may render honeybee colonies more susceptible to infection and pests.",2023/02//,2023,10.3390/insects14020174,14,2,,,,,"['neonicotinoids', 'pesticides', 'insects', 'humoral response', 'inflammatory response', 'invertebrate immunity']",2075-4450,WOS:000939059500001,,0,,0,788

However, the data on wild bee sensitivity to pesticides are scarce. As it may not be possible to stop using pesticides at the moment due to a growing food demand, we need to make every effort to ensure that they are used in a way that do not jeopardize pollinator populations. We tested the toxicity of three agrochemicals, namely Dursban 480 EC with chlorpyrifos as active ingredient (a.i.), Sherpa 100 EC (a.i. cypermethrin), and Mospilan 20 SP (a.i. acetamiprid), to female Osmia bicornis through oral and contact exposures. The estimated LC50 s at infinite-time were lower than concentrations recommended for field application for Dursban in both exposure routes, whereas in case of Sherpa and Mospilan the values were lower for oral exposure only. Regardless of the exposure route, high mortality in less than 24 hours was observed in Dursban-treated bees at a fraction of concentration actually used by farmers in the field, indicating high toxicity of this product to O. bicornis. Therefore, some commonly used insecticides may cause unacceptable effects to pollinators even when applied in the field according to recommendations, indicating the urgent need for revising current pesticide usage regulations. © 2021, HARD Publishing Company.

Nonetheless, uncertainties remain about their impact under field conditions. Most studies have been conducted on Apis mellifera and tested single compounds. However, in agricultural environments, bees are often exposed to multiple pesticides. We explore the synergistic mortality between a neonicotinoid (clothianidin) and an ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting fungicide (propiconazole) in three bee species (A. mellifera, Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) following oral exposure in the laboratory. RESULTS: We developed a new approach based on the binomial proportion test to analyse synergistic interactions. We estimated uptake of clothianidin per foraging bout in honey bees foraging on seed-coated rapeseed fields. We found significant synergistic mortality in all three bee species exposed to non-lethal doses of propiconazole and their respective LD10 of clothianidin. Significant synergism was only found at the first assessment times in A. mellifera (4 and 24 h) and B. terrestris (4 h), but persisted throughout the experiment (96 h) in O. bicornis. O. bicornis was also the most sensitive species to clothianidin. CONCLUSION: Our results underscore the importance to test pesticide combinations likely to occur in agricultural environments, and to include several bee species in environmental risk assessment schemes. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry",2017///,2017,10.1002/ps.4449,73,6,1236,1243,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006314459&doi=10.1002%2fps.4449&partnerID=40&md5=1fb3bfcbc105952ff4abfb3ac370d3e6,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,790
481,JOUR,Chemical Stimulants and Stressors Impact the Outcome of Virus Infection and Immune Gene Expression in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"['Parekh, F.', 'Daughenbaugh, K.F.', 'Flenniken, M.L.']",Frontiers in Immunology,"Western honey bees (Apis mellifera) are ecologically, agriculturally, and economically important plant pollinators. High average annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US have been partially attributed to agrochemical exposure and virus infections. To examine the potential negative synergistic impacts of agrochemical exposure and virus infection, as well as the potential promise of phytochemicals to ameliorate the impact of pathogenic infections on honey bees, we infected bees with a panel of viruses (i.e., Flock House virus, deformed wing virus, or Sindbis virus) and exposed to one of three chemical compounds. Specifically, honey bees were fed sucrose syrup containing: (1) thyme oil, a phytochemical and putative immune stimulant, (2) fumagillin, a beekeeper applied fungicide, or (3) clothianidin, a grower-applied insecticide. We determined that virus abundance was lower in honey bees fed 0.16 ppm thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup, compared to bees fed sucrose syrup alone. Parallel analysis of honey bee gene expression revealed that honey bees fed thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup had higher expression of key RNAi genes (argonaute-2 and dicer-like), antimicrobial peptide expressing genes (abaecin and hymenoptaecin), and vitellogenin, a putative honey bee health and age indicator, compared to bees fed only sucrose syrup. Virus abundance was higher in bees fed fumagillin (25 ppm or 75 ppm) or 1 ppb clothianidin containing sucrose syrup relative to levels in bees fed only sucrose syrup. Whereas, honey bees fed 10 ppb clothianidin had lower virus levels, likely because consuming a near lethal dose of insecticide made them poor hosts for virus infection. The negative impact of fumagillin and clothianidin on honey bee health was indicated by the lower expression of argonaute-2, dicer-like, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin, and vitellogenin. Together, these results indicate that chemical stimulants and stressors impact the outcome of virus infection and immune gene expression in honey bees.

122,JOUR,Field-realistic exposure to the novel insecticide flupyradifurone reduces reproductive output in a bumblebee (Bombus impatiens),"['Richardson, LI', 'Siviter, H', 'Jha, S', 'Muth, F']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Novel insecticides are continuously being developed for application in response to increased legal restriction of previously developed insecticides and resistance in target insects. These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality. Despite this fact, sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproduction, are not mandatorily assessed within the regulatory process. Our findings highlight the importance of determining sub-lethal effects of pesticides across developmental stages, as well as using pollinator species other than honeybees within the regulatory process.",2024/08//,2024,10.1111/1365-2664.14706,61,8,1932,1943,,,"['adult', 'bee', 'bumblebee health', 'butenolide', 'insecticide', 'larval development', 'microcolony', 'mortality', 'pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'reproduction', 'risk assessment', 'sub-lethal effects', 'sublethal effect']",0021-8901,WOS:001249586600001,,0,,0,792

When applied as seed treatment, residues of the tested molecules in the pollen and nectar samples were present below quantifiable levels (< LOQ). At 3 days after spraying, residues of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were 0.86 and 0.96 mg/kg in the leaf samples, 0.15 and 0.23 mg/kg in the pollen samples, and 0.07 and 0.07 mg/kg in the nectar samples, respectively. Further, the foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment. Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application. Nonetheless, the foraging activity was comparable to the control levels 7 days after spraying.

Here we present for the first time a study showing effects of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor on solitary bees. Bees submitted to long term exposure of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor (5 µg dm-3, 10 µg dm-3, 50 µg dm-3) and control were observed regarding their survival rate. Moreover, we recorded metrics related to flower visitation and flight performance. We discover that the highest field realistic dose is lethal to Osmia bicornis along five days of exposure.

Several potential factors have been studied as possible causes of declining pollinator health, such as parasites and pathogens, exposure to agricultural pesticides, habitat loss and/or climate change. More recently, a combination of these factors rather than a single cause have been blamed for observed pollinator losses, but field studies of such interactions are challenging, especially in the presence of confounding environmental stressors. We therefore examined the impact of single and combined stressors on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a generally healthy Australian population. We exposed workers during their larval development and drones until they reached sexual maturity to the neonicotinoid pesticide Thiamethoxam, at concentrations more than 20 times lower than we initially measured in the field, the microsporidian gut pathogen Nosema apis or both stressors at the same time. We found that simultaneous exposure significantly reduced bee health. We observed a substantial increase in mortality and a reduction of immunocompetence in workers exposed to both the pathogen and the pesticide. We conclude that the exposure of generally healthy bees to multiple environmental stressors results in synergistic effects where the effects are expected to negatively impact performance and could be sufficient to trigger colony collapse. We found that the vast majority of males did not survive to sexual maturity after exposure to very low levels of Thiamethoxam. This would not only reduce the reproductive success of individual colonies, but can also impact gene flow and genetic diversity at the population level, which are both known as key components of honey bee health. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jip.2018.10.005,159,,78,86,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055575152&doi=10.1016%2fj.jip.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=d9ed9a9090c05697a15e59d9df1ede3c,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,795

Thiamethoxam,"['Stephenson, G.L.', 'Solomon, K.R.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess several higher-tier studies on the effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5 µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6 ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1 g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicates that TMX has no adverse effects on viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the treatment of seeds with thiamethoxam, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388568,20,06-Jul,365,382,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036570302&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388568&partnerID=40&md5=caf3b85e15ff10f896cae621455c9207,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,798

Recently, global populations of honey bees have rapidly declined owing to colony collapse disorder (CCD), the mechanism of which is still unknown. Here, we used mRNA levels of heat shock protein (HSP) genes as molecular markers of response to three types of external stress: thermal shock, flower-thinning agents, and pesticides. When worker bees were exposed to temperatures of 4, 27, 40, 45 and 50. °C for 1. h, decreased survival occurred only at 50. °C. Further, increased levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90, but not hsp40, were detected, and reached a maximum at 45. °C, particularly in the hypopharyngeal glands and fat bodies. Artificial ingestion of two flower-thinning agents containing either 0.1% boron and zinc, or 1% sulfur increased hsp70 and grp78 levels at different rates without affecting hsp40 and hsp90 levels, and had no effect on workers' mortality. However, ingestion of imidacloprid solution (0.5-50. ppm) increased mortality in workers and decreased the levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results showed that the responses of honey bees to each hsp are differential and highly specific to different stresses.

However, honey bees are usually exposed to pesticide mixtures under field conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of individual pesticides and mixtures of clothianidin (CLO) with eight other pesticides [carbaryl (CAR), thiodicarb (THI), chlorpyrifos (CHL), beta-cyfluthrin (BCY), gamma-cyhalothrin (GCY), tetraconazole (TET), spinosad (SPI) and indoxacarb (IND)] on honey bees using a feeding method. Toxicity tests of a 4-day exposure to individual pesticides revealed that CLO had the highest toxicity to A. mellifera, with an LC50 value of 0.24 μg a.i. mL-1, followed by IND and CHL with LC50 values of 3.40 and 3.56 μg a.i. mL-1, respectively. SPI and CAR had relatively low toxicities, with LC50 values of 7.19 and 8.42 μg a.i. mL-1, respectively. In contrast, TET exhibited the least toxicity, with an LC50 value of 258.7 μg a.i. mL-1. Most binary mixtures of CLO with other pesticides exerted additive and antagonistic effects. However, all the ternary mixtures containing CLO and TET (except for CLO+TET+THD) elicited synergistic responses to bees. Either increased numbers of components in the mixture or/and a unique mode of action appeared to be responsible for the higher toxicity of mixtures.

In the eusocial Hymenoptera, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of male sexuals (drones) and efficient collaborative brood care by female workers. Therefore, sublethal insecticide effects on sperm and glands used in larval feeding (hypopharyngeal glands (HPG)) would provide key mechanisms for population declines in eusocial insects. However, while negative impacts for bumblebee colony fitness have been documented, the effects of insecticide exposure on individual physiology are less well understood. Here, we show that field-realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam significantly impair Bombus terrestris sperm and HPGs, thereby providing plausible mechanisms underlying bumblebee population decline. In the laboratory, drones and workers were exposed to five thiamethoxam concentrations (4.5 to 1000 ng ml(-1)). Then, survival, food consumption, body mass, HPG development, sperm quantity and viability were assessed. At all concentrations, drones were more exposed than workers due to higher food consumption. Increased body mass was observed in drones starting at 20 ng ml(-1) and in workers at 100 ng ml(-1). Furthermore, environmentally realistic concentrations (4.5-40 ng ml(-1)) did not significantly affect survival or consumption for either sex. However, thiamethoxam exposure significantly negatively affected both spermviability and HPG development at all tested concentrations. Therefore, the results indicate a trade-off between survival and fitness components, possibly due to costly detoxification. Since sperm and HPG are corner stones of colony fitness, the data offer plausible mechanisms for bumblebee population declines. To adequately mitigate ongoing biodiversity declines for the eusocial insects, this study suggests it is essential to evaluate the impact of insecticides on fitness parameters of both sexuals and workers.

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weakened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments. However, the activity of glucose oxidase, enabling bees to sterilize colony and brood food, was significantly decreased only by the combination of both factors compared with control, Nosema or imidacloprid groups, suggesting a synergistic interaction and in the long term a higher susceptibility of the colony to pathogens.

Much of the previous research on the effects of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticide that has gained attention for non-target effects, on bees focused on the consumption of contaminated food resources by a limited number of eusocial species. However, neonicotinoids are known to accumulate and persist in soils at concentrations 2 to 60 times greater than in food resources, and may represent an important route of exposure for diverse and ecologically important ground-nesting bees. This study aimed to assess the effect of chronic contact exposure to realistic soil concentrations of imidacloprid, the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticide, on bee longevity, development speed, and body mass. Cohorts of Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata were used as proxies for ground-nesting species. We observed species- and sex-specific changes to adult longevity, development speed, and mass in response to increasing concentrations of imidacloprid. These results suggest that chronic exposure to nesting substrates contaminated with neonicotinoids may represent an important route of exposure that could have considerable physiological and ecological consequences for bees and plant-pollinator interactions. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019///,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-40031-9,9,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062619502&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-40031-9&partnerID=40&md5=4926db55667866309dcb8f393bb19712,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,803

If two species are similarly sensitive to a toxin their dose-response relationships will be similar. We propose a method to facilitate comparison between dose-response relationships, namely the response-response relationship, which can be applied to any biomarkers whose responses to the same pollutant are measured across a similar range of doses. We apply the method to bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) exposed to a dietary pesticide, imidacloprid, and we investigate both lethal and sublethal biomarkers. Results: We found cross-species similarity in dose-dependent responses, but only in certain sublethal biomarkers. In honey bees, sublethal biomarkers were more sensitive than mortality. In bumble bees, fecundity was the most sensitive biomarker. Conclusion: Our results provisionally suggest the existence of cross-species generalities. The greater sensitivity of sublethal biomarkers than mortality suggests that testing protocols which are overly focussed on mortality may underestimate the ecological impacts of toxic pollutants.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.010,437,,55,60,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200005,,0,,0,804

In young queens exposed to thiacloprid (200 μg/l or 2000 μg/l) or clothianidin (10 μg/l or 50 μg/l), the total hemocyte number and the proportion of active, differentiated hemocytes was significantly reduced. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence namely the wound healing/melanisation response, as well as the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph were impaired.

Neonicotinoids are systemic pesticides that are absorbed by plants, transported, and accumulated in plant tissues, including nectar and pollen. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive assessment of the level of neonicotinoid contamination and the associated health risks to non-targeted organisms in commercial honey and pollen produced in China. This study collected 160 batches of honey and 26 batches of pollen from different regions and plant sources in China, analyzed the residue patterns of neonicotinoid pesticides, and comprehensively evaluated the exposure risks to non-targeted organisms including bees (adults and larvae) and humans. Furthermore, this study addresses this imperative by establishing a high-throughput, rapid, and ultra-sensitive indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) based on broad-spectrum monoclonal antibodies to detect and quantify neonicotinoids, with validation conducted using the LC-MS/MS method. The findings indicated that 59.4 % of honey samples contained at least one of eight neonicotinoids, and the ic-ELISA rapid detection and calculation method could detect all the samples containing neonicotinoids.

Colonies fed 5 ng/g (ppb) imidacloprid in sugar syrup showed increased brood production, lower temperature variability, higher CO2 production and had more foragers compared to control colonies fed unadulterated syrup, but treatment did not affect adult bee numbers or average hive temperatures, and did not increase food stores, daily food acquisition or colony survivorship. These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids.

Honey bees as well as other pollinators are nectar and pollen foragers and thus are exposed to an extensive range of phytochemicals. Understanding the synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects of plant secondary metabolites and pesticides in honey bees may help to protect honey bee colonies against agrochemicals. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the impact of dietary phytochemical composition on the residual concentration of three pesticides: imidacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and tebuconazole in exposed honey bees. Honey bees were given different diets based on pollen or nectar from four plants: Reseda odorata, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Trifolium repens for two days. Thereafter, they were orally exposed to 10 ng/bee imidacloprid or contact-exposed to 0.9 μg/bee tau-fluvalinate or 5 μg/bee tebuconazole. After 1 h of oral exposure or 24 h of contact exposure, the honey bees were anaesthetised with CO2, sacrificed by freezing, extracted with a validated QuEChERS method, and residual pesticide concentrations were determined by LC-QTRAP-MS/MS. The phytochemical composition in the given diets were profiled with an UHPLC-Q Exactive-MS/MS. The results revealed that the dietary phytochemical composition has a noteworthy influence on the concentration of residual pesticides in honey bees. The correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that flavonoids have a reducing effect on the residual concentration of imidacloprid and tau-fluvalinate in honey bees.

During winter, honey bee colonies rely on stored honey and beebread, which is frequently contaminated with the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. To determine whether neonicotinoid exposure affects overwinter survival of Apis mellifera L., we chronically exposed overwintering field colonies and winter workers in the laboratory to thiamethoxam or clothianidin at different concentrations and monitored survival and feed consumption. We also investigated the sublethal effects of chronic thiamethoxam exposure on colony pathogen load, queen quality, and colony temperature regulation. Under field conditions, high doses of thiamethoxam significantly increased overwinter mortality compared to controls, with field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam showing no significant effect on colony overwinter survival. Under laboratory conditions, chronic neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreased survival of winter workers relative to negative control at all doses tested. Chronic high-dose thiamethoxam exposure was not shown to impact pathogen load or queen quality, and field-realistic concentrations of thiamethoxam did not affect colony temperature homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic environmental neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreases survival of winter workers in the laboratory, but only chronic high-dose thiamethoxam significantly decreases overwinter survival of colonies in the field. © 2019 by the authors.

However, in field realistic conditions mixtures of products classified as harmless to bees can lead to a synergistic increase of toxicity on honey bees, as known for ergosterol biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides combined with pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. For substances like fertilizers, usually no information on potential side effects on bees is available. Initially, effects from tank mixes containing insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers were investigated under laboratory conditions by use of a spray chamber contact test. For selected combinations, higher tier studies were carried out. Mixtures containing thiacloprid, boscalid and dimoxystrobin with boron fertilizers showed no increase of mortality. In contrast, tank mixes of thiacloprid formulations and EBI-fungicides resulted within 24 h in synergistic mortality increase in laboratory, semi-field and field. Actually, a short time interval of 24 h between individually applied potentially synergistic products like pyrethroid insecticides and EBI fungicides led to an increase of mortality up to 100% under laboratory conditions, indicating that the detoxification was still ongoing, resulting in an increased susceptibility for other stressors during the metabolization process. In conclusion, tank mixtures do not always lead to an increase of honey bee toxicity. However, former published findings about synergistic impacts between neonicotinoides and EBI-fungicides could be confirmed.

516,JOUR,Spinosad toxicity to pollinators and associated risk,"['Mayes, M.A.', 'Thompson, G.D.', 'Husband, B.', 'Miles, M.M.']",Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Spinosad is a natural insecticide derived from an actinomycete bacterium species, Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao 1990), that displays the efficacy of a synthetic insecticide. It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",2003///,2003,10.1007/0-387-21731-2_2,179,,37,71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242371130&doi=10.1007%2f0-387-21731-2_2&partnerID=40&md5=db500ad2fa15244e47bc391f46f4601a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,813

This study aimed to isolate, identify, and investigate the potential of honeybee gut bacterial strains in mitigating the detrimental effects of insecticides on honeybees and extending their lifespan. The efficacy of seven honeybee gut bacterial strains in reducing insecticide toxicity was evaluated. Through the identification of honeybee gut bacterial isolates using 16s rRNA, seven strains were identified, namely Priestia endophytica, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Peribacillus frigoritolerans, B. subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus tequilensis. The experimental results revealed that bees treated with these gut bacteria significantly reduced oxidative stress markers and detoxification enzyme levels compared to untreated bees. Moreover, the treated bees demonstrated enhanced immune responses. The bees treated with deltamethrin + intestinal bacteria showed an increase in bees’ lifespan to 6.33 days compared to a lifespan of 4 days with deltamethrin only. Similarly, bees treated with acetamiprid intestinal bacteria had further extended to 10.33 days compared to a lifespan of 7.67 days with acetamiprid. These findings suggest that using honeybee gut bacterial strains may serve as a sustainable strategy to mitigate the harmful impacts of insecticides on honeybees, thereby promoting their overall health and contributing to the preservation of pollination services and apiculture.

Toxicological assessment is therefore crucial for understanding the overall agrochemical risks to stingless bees. Therefore, the lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals commonly used in crops (copper sulfate, glyphosate, and spinosad) on the behavior and gut microbiota of the stingless bee, Partamona helleri, were assessed using chronic exposure during the larval stage. When used at the field-recommended rates, both copper sulfate (200 µg of active ingredient/bee; a.i µg bee−1) and spinosad (8.16 a.i µg bee−1) caused a decrease in bee survival, while glyphosate (148 a.i µg bee−1) did not show any significant effects. No significant adverse effects on bee development were observed in any treatment with CuSO4 or glyphosate, but spinosad (0.08 or 0.03 a.i µg bee −1) increased the number of deformed bees and reduced their body mass. Agrochemicals changed the behavior of bees and composition of the gut microbiota of adult bees, and metals such as copper accumulated in the bees’ bodies.

This concern arises from their crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and global food production. Therefore, an extensive investigation has been conducted to explore the intricate relationship between pesticides and the biological development of honey bees in the Rahim Yar Khan region. This study assessed the impact of four pesticides (Emamectin benzoate, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid) on honey bee eggs, larvae, and adult bees under controlled laboratory conditions. The pesticides were applied at concentrations of 10%, 30%, and 50%, as per regional agricultural recommendations. A zero-toxicity control was also included for comparison. Toxicity evaluations were conducted through contact exposure, and Probit and regression analyses were performed using SPSS software to comprehensively assess the toxicity profiles. The study revealed significant adverse effects on the immediate behavioral responses of A. mellifera following pesticide exposure. These effects included heightened agitation, narcotic-like symptoms, audible hovering, crawling, ceased food-sharing behavior, and reduced proboscis extension. Chlorpyrifos exhibited the highest toxicity against adult bees, while Emamectin Benzoate had the least toxicity. Regarding honey bee eggs, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid were notably more toxic, whereas Emamectin Benzoate exhibited the least toxicity. The impact on larvae varied across developmental stages and pesticides, with Imidacloprid, Chlorpyrifos, and Acetamiprid causing significant mortality, while Emamectin Benzoate showed lower toxicity. The study highlights that Emamectin Benzoate demonstrates lower toxicity compared to other insecticides. This emphasizes the importance of balancing effective pest management with the preservation of pollinator health. The findings underscore the need for informed and sustainable approaches to pesticide use, taking into consideration the potential repercussions on honeybee development and behavior. © Iqbal, et al.",2024///,2024,10.3897/ejfa.2024.122884,2024,36,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196789830&doi=10.3897%2fejfa.2024.122884&partnerID=40&md5=c74b64ea0385de562bae3fba000785b3,Scopus,"['Insecticides', 'apiculture', 'pesticide exposure', 'biological development', 'honeybee health']",,,,0,,0,816

Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies. Larvae that had been fed either the pesticide or LPS were removed at a significantly higher rate than control larvae.

Our data showed that neonicotinoids reduced honeybee drone survival by 51%, increased drifting behaviour to non-maternal colonies by 100%, delayed flight activities by 3 days and reduced number of living sperm by 28%.

Among these drivers the usage of pesticides is believed to be crucial. While the use of key bee-harming insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, has been reduced by regulatory authorities, novel, less studied substances have occupied their market niche. Understanding the threat of these chemicals to bees is, therefore, crucial to their conservation. Here we focus on sulfoxaflor, a novel insecticide, targeting the same neural receptor as the neonicotinoids. In stark contrast to the growing concerns around its negative impacts on bee health, a recent assessment has resulted in the extension of its authorisations across the USA. However, such assessments may underestimate risks by overlooking interactive impacts of multiple stressors. Here we investigated co-occurring, lethal and sublethal risks of sulfoxaflor and a dietary stress for bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), a key pollinator. Specifically, we employed a novel microcolony design, where, for the first time in bees, pesticide exposure mimicked natural degradation. We orally exposed workers to sulfoxaflor and a sugar-deficient diet in a fully factorial design. Field realistic, worst-case sulfoxaflor exposure caused a sharp increase in bee mortality. At sublethal concentrations, sulfoxaflor negatively affected bee fecundity, but not survival. Nutritional stress reduced bee fecundity and synergistically or additively aggravated impacts of sulfoxaflor on bee survival, egg laying and larval production. Our data show that non-mitigated label uses of sulfoxaflor may have major, yet severely neglected effects on bumblebee health, which may be exacerbated by nutritional stress. By unravelling mechanistic interactions of synergistic risks, our study highlights the need to overcome inherent limitations of Environmental Risk Assessment schemes, which, being based on a “single stressor paradigm”, may fail to inform policymakers of the real risks of pesticide use. © 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148680,795,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109426130&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.148680&partnerID=40&md5=829e5f6e6568702aba4efc80270da5c7,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Anthropogenic factors', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus terrestris', 'Bumblebee', 'colony', 'degradation', 'Degradation', 'fecundity', 'fertility', 'Fertility', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'malnutrition', 'Malnutrition', 'Market niche', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'Multiple stressors', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nutrition', 'Nutrition', 'Nutritional stress', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Regulatory authorities', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'United States']",,,,0,,0,821

The challenges of navigating and learning to manipulate many different flowers underline the critical role learning plays for the foraging success and survival of bees. We assessed the impacts of both acute and chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of a widely applied neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on bumblebee odour learning and memory. Although bees exposed to acute doses showed conditioned responses less frequently than controls, we found no difference in the number of individuals able to learn at field-realistic exposure levels. However, following chronic pesticide exposure, bees exposed to field-realistic levels learnt more slowly and their short-term memory was significantly impaired following exposure to 2.4 ppb pesticide. These results indicate that field-realistic pesticide exposure can have appreciable impacts on learning and memory, with potential implications for essential individual behaviour and colony fitness.",2015/11/16/,2015,10.1038/srep16508,5,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000364667600001,,0,,0,822
32,JOUR,Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees,"['Gill, RJ', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, O', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production(1-3). Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.",2012/11/01/,2012,10.1038/nature11585,491,7422,105,U119,,,,0028-0836,WOS:000310434500039,,0,,0,823

In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that sub-lethal exposure to neurotoxic, neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect pollinator immunocompetence and could amplify the effects of diseases, likely contributing to pollinator declines. However, a direct pathway connecting neonicotinoids and immune functions remains elusive. In this study we show that haemocytes and non-neural tissues of the honeybee Apis mellifera express the building blocks of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are the target of neonicotinoids. In addition, we demonstrate that the haemocytes, which form the cellular arm of the innate immune system, actively express choline acetyltransferase, a key enzyme necessary to synthesize acetylcholine. In a last step, we show that the expression of this key enzyme is affected by field-realistic doses of clothianidin, a widely used neonicotinoid.

We evaluated the survival and hypopharyngeal gland development of adult worker honey bees, and the survival of the worker brood when chronically exposed to thiamethoxam or thiamethoxam and prothioconazole in combination. RESULTS: We found that 30 days of exposure to 40 μg kg–1 of thiamethoxam significantly (P < 0.001) increased the frequency of death in worker adults by four times relative to solvent control. The worker brood required 23 times higher doses of thiamethoxam (1 mg L–1 or 909 μg kg–1) before a significant (P = 0.04), 3.9 times increase in frequency of death was observed relative to solvent control. No additive effects of simultaneous exposure of worker adults or brood to thiamethoxam and prothioconazole were observed. At day 8 and day 12, the hypopharyngeal gland acinar diameter was not significantly different (P > 0.05) between controls and adult workers exposed to thiamethoxam and/or prothioconazole.

Pesticides have been proposed as one of the main cause of pollinators decline. Several studies show that variety of pesticides co-exist in environment and also in bee products at the same time and might therefore synergise. Fipronil, cypermethrin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid are agriculturally well known and used insecticides as well as fungicide imazalil. EBI fungicides like imazalil are functioning as detoxification inhibitor tools in insects. Thereby, the fungicide and insecticide co-occurrence might lead to synergy in bees. The cocktail-effects between insecticides and fungicides are still little studied. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of previously mentioned pesticides and their mixtures impact on bumble bee longevity and feeding rate. The bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) were fed with syrup containing different single pesticides and their combinations. Bees mortality and feeding rate was daily monitored. Here we show that 3 of these insecticides are synergising with fungicide and due that causing significant decrease in bumble bees longevity and feeding rate. The results from this experiment allows us to suppose that EBI fungicide imazalil inhibits the detoxification processes in bees and due that toxicity of insecticides increases. Although fungicides are considered as quite safe to bees when used appropriately and alone but in combination with insecticides might lead to faster individual death. Several studies have demonstrated impacts of single pesticides on bees, but yet there is a lack of data of synergistic effects.

Honeybees inevitably come into contact with environmental stressors that are not intended to target honeybees, such as pesticides. Although large-scale losses of honeybee colonies are thought to be associated with viruses, these viruses usually lead to covert infections and to not cause acute damage if the bees do not encounter outside stressors. To reveal the potential relationship between acute pesticides and viruses, we applied different doses of imidacloprid to adult bees that were primarily infected with low levels (4.3 × 105 genome copies) of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) to observe whether the acute oral toxicity of imidacloprid was able to elevate the level of CBPV. Here, we found that the titer of CBPV was significantly elevated in adult bees after 96 h of acute treatment with imidacloprid at the highest dose 66.9 ng/bee compared with other treatments and controls. Our study provides clear evidence that exposure to acute high doses of imidacloprid in honeybees persistently infected by CBPV can exert a remarkably negative effect on honeybee survival. These results imply that acute environmental stressors might be one of the major accelerators causing rapid viral replication, which may progress to cause mass proliferation and dissemination and lead to colony decline. The present study will be useful for better understanding the harm caused by this pesticide, especially regarding how honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might be altered by acute pesticide exposure. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.258,630,,487,494,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042713901&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.02.258&partnerID=40&md5=6241bf25d47c1976be38365af00d21b6,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,829

However, these lack micronutrients present in nectar and honey, and thus may nutritionally stress colonies. Given the many stressors faced by honey bees in the environment, we evaluated how honey bees fed supplemental carbohydrates responded in combination with heat (45 °C), cold (4 °C), or imidacloprid (0.48 ng/ml) exposure. Bees were fed either honey, SS, HFCS, or HFCS + pollen and then exposed to abiotic stress treatments in the lab. Hive bee mortality was not affected by heat or cold stress, but mortality was greater for bees fed SS in imidacloprid treatments. Levels of stress proteins (superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein (HSP70), and potentially esterase) were quantified to determine sublethal stress. SOD levels were reduced in SS and HFCS treatments, indicating these diets impaired a response to oxidative stress, particularly at 45 °C. HSP70 levels were higher in the imidacloprid treatment, with no differences between control and temperature treatments. Diet interacted significantly with stress treatment with generally negative responses to HFCS. There was no effect of diet on esterase levels, though activity was much lower at 4 °C. In semifield trials, colonies with newly emerged bees fed SS experienced higher rates of worker mortality. In cage and field trials, bees consumed significantly more honey and HFCS + P than SS and HFCS.

We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 μg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 μg/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 μg/L and 40 μg/L imidacloprid.

In this study, we evaluated the lethal and sublethal effects of the spinosad-based formulation Tracer® on foragers of the stingless bee Plebeia lucii Moure (Apidae: Meliponini). Groups of bees were fed a pure diet (negative control) or a diet at different concentrations of spinosad. Positive control groups consisted of bees orally exposed to a diet with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Next, flight behavior, body mass, and respiration rate were evaluated in surviving bees. The results showed that bees´ survival was reduced by all concentrations of spinosad, when compared with the negative control. Bee locomotion—walking and flight—was reduced in accordance with the increase in spinosad concentrations; however, body mass and respiration rate were not altered.

Cholinergic pesticides and their extensive use have been correlated to the decline of pollinators and there is evidence that pesticides act as neuroendocrine disruptors affecting the metabolism of neuropeptides. However, there is a big absence of studies with quantitative results correlating the effect of pesticide exposure with changes on neuropeptides insects, and most of them are conducted under laboratory conditions, typically with individual active ingredients. In this study, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate pesticide effects on honey bees through the analysis of (neuro)peptides. The workflow consists of a rapid extraction method and liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole for preselected neuropeptides. For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≥ 500 μg kg−1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ≤ 20 μg kg−1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins.

162,JOUR,"Colony environment and absence of brood enhance tolerance to a neonicotinoid in winter honey bee workers, Apis mellifera","['Bovier, M.', 'Camenzind, D.W.', 'Brown, A.F.', 'Jeker, L.', 'Retschnig, G.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Straub, L.']",Ecotoxicology,"In eusocial insects, worker longevity is essential to ensure colony survival in brood-free periods. Trade-offs between longevity and other traits may render long-living workers in brood-free periods more susceptible to pesticides compared to short-lived ones. Further, colony environment (e.g., adequate nutrition) may enable workers to better cope with pesticides, yet data comparing long vs. short-living workers and the role of the colony environment for pesticide tolerance are scarce. Here, we show that long-living honey bee workers, Apis mellifera, are less susceptible to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam than short-lived workers, and that susceptibility was further reduced when workers were acclimatized under colony compared to laboratory conditions. Following an OECD protocol, freshly-emerged workers were exposed to thiamethoxam in summer and winter and either acclimatized within their colony or in the laboratory. Mortality and sucrose consumption were measured daily and revealed that winter workers were significantly less susceptible than summer workers, despite being exposed to higher thiamethoxam dosages due to increased food consumption. Disparencies in fat body activity, which is key for detoxification, may explain why winter bees were less susceptible. Furthermore, colony acclimatization significantly reduced susceptibility towards thiamethoxam in winter workers likely due to enhanced protein nutrition. Brood absence and colony environment seem to govern workers’ ability to cope with pesticides, which should be considered in risk assessments. Since honey bee colony losses occur mostly over winter, long-term studies assessing the effects of pesticide exposure on winter bees are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02758-8,33,6,608,621,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193948446&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-024-02758-8&partnerID=40&md5=7503c10cfc68fdbc939e99db2b0deb24,Scopus,"['acclimation', 'acclimatization', 'Acclimatization', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behaviour', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'Eusociality', 'fat pad', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'insecticide resistance', 'Insecticides', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'OECD', 'organism colony', 'physiology', 'protein intake', 'risk assessment', 'season', 'Seasons', 'sucrose', 'sugar intake', 'summer', 'survival', 'Survival', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'winter', 'worker (insect)']",,,,0,,0,836
688,JOUR,Contrasting effects of Imidacloprid on habituation in 7- and 8-day-old honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Guez, D.', 'Suchail, S.', 'Gauthier, M.', 'Maleszka, R.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"We examined the effects of sublethal doses (0.1, 1, and 10 ng per animal) of a new neonicotinoid insecticide, Imidacloprid, on habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) reared under laboratory conditions. In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8-10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4-7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4 h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself.

The contribution of the neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., clothianidin and imidacloprid) to this decline is controversial, and key to understanding their risk is whether the astonishingly low levels found in the nectar and pollen of plants is sufficient to deliver neuroactive levels to their site of action: the bee brain. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) fed field levels [10 nM, 2.1 ppb (w/w)] of neonicotinoid accumulate between 4 and 10 nM in their brains within 3 days. Acute (minutes) exposure of cultured neurons to 10 nM clothianidin, but not imidacloprid, causes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent rapid mitochondrial depolarization. However, a chronic (2 days) exposure to 1 nM imidacloprid leads to a receptor-dependent increased sensitivity to a normally innocuous level of acetylcholine, which now also causes rapid mitochondrial depolarization in neurons. Finally, colonies exposed to this level of imidacloprid show deficits in colony growth and nest condition compared with untreated colonies.

The intensive use of insecticides from the neonicotinoids group is among the possible causal factors of this decline, including also sub-lethal effects. However, the use of synthetic insecticides has been increased on a global scale in the recent decades. In order to evaluate an alternative to the use of neonicotinoids, this work investigated the effects of a bioinsecticide and its major compound on A. mellifera (Apidae: Hymenoptera), one of the main pollinators of crop plants. For this, bees were exposed, by contact and ingestion, to the essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii (Poaceae: Poales), to geraniol (major compound) and the insecticide imidacloprid to evaluate the toxicity and behavioral effects as well as the locomotion changes and immune responses of bees treated with these compounds. In general, toxicity was greater through ingestion and the insecticide imidacloprid was more toxic to A. mellifera compared to the essential oil and its major compound. The individual and collective behaviors (i.e. trophallaxis, grooming, avoidance) as well as the immune responses of bees were not significantly affected by bioinsecticides. However, the locomotion response and flight orientation of the bees were significantly altered by insecticide when administered by ingestion.

Neonicotinoid insecticides are one of the most widely used pesticides in tomato crops in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of four neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) to bumblebees based on the OECD guidelines (No.246, 247). The 48 hr LD50 (μg a.i. /bumblebee) values in the acute contact toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.467; dinotefuran, 3.741; imidacloprid, 3.967; and thiamethoxam, 0.747. The 48 hr LD50 values in the acute oral toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.005; dinotefuran, 0.056; imidacloprid, 0.325; and thiamethoxam, 0.018. The acute contact and oral toxicity of the test insecticides to bumblebees from most to least toxic was clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran > imidacloprid.

The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI).

Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [H-3]alpha-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [H-3]PCP binding in the insect nAChR.

The use of chaperone proteins has been key to successful functional expression of these receptors in heterologous systems, permitting functional and pharmacological studies of insect nAChRs with particular subunit composition. Here, we report the first use of the chaperone protein, NACHO, to enable functional expression of an insect nAChR, the α6 subunit from Apis mellifera, in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is also the first report of functional expression of a homomeric insect α6 nAChR. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology we show that the acetylcholine EC50 of the α6 receptor is 0.88 μM and that acetylcholine responses are antagonized by α-bungarotoxin. Spinosad showed agonist actions and kept the ion channel open when co-applied with acetylcholine, reinforcing the α6 nAChR subunit as a key molecular target for the spinosyn class of insecticide. The use of NACHO may provide a basis for future expression studies of insect α6 nAChRs, potentially providing a tool for the discovery of novel insecticides. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.pestbp.2021.105030,181,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122641741&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2021.105030&partnerID=40&md5=a42a9b7e38233ba679c3a6f526a73692,Scopus,"['acetylcholine', 'Acetylcholine', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Functional expression', 'genetics', 'insect', 'Insecta', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'NACHO', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor', 'nicotinic receptor', 'oocyte', 'Oocytes', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'Xenopus laevis']",,0,,1,10

The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids. These findings on the diverse mode of action for neonicotinoids to target and non-target receptor would be helpful for on novel insecticides design with high bioactivity as well as good selectivity based on the structure of different insect nAChR.

The Amα1/β2 subunit ratio influenced the efficacy of imidacloprid and thiacloprid, but hardly affected that of clothianidin.

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024/08/29/,2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11,1,2196-5641,WOS:001303583400003,,,,,"['AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Cowpea aphid', 'Honeybee', 'NAChR', 'Neonicotinoids']",,0,,1,15

The molecular interaction mode to honeybee nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) for the newly found compound VS-04 obviously differed from that of the known imidacloprid. The newly synthesized phenylacetohydrazone compounds 3c and 3e caused soybean aphids to have a moderate mortality rate of approximately 70% at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. Importantly, the bee-toxicity study confirmed that compounds 3c and 3e showed much lower acute contact toxicity with LD50 value (30.35 and 124.4 mu g/bee) of 3 similar to 4 orders of magnitude than that of imidacloprid (0.019 mu g/bee).

Flupyrimin (FLP) is a novel nicotinic insecticide with unique biological properties and no cross-resistance, and is safe for pollinators. Using FLP as the lead compound, a series of novel compounds were designed and synthesized by replacing the amide fragment with a sulfonamideone. Their structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS spectra. Bioassay results showed that compound 2j had good insecticidal activity against Aphis glycines with an LC50 value of 20.93 mg/L. Meanwhile, compound 2j showed significantly lower acute oral and contact toxicity to Apis mellifera. In addition, compound 2j interacted well with the protein in insect acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP). The molecular docking on honeybee nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) indicated that the sulfonamide group of compound 2j did not form a hydrogen bond with Arg173 of the β subunit, which conforms to the reported low bee-toxicity conformation.

This study investigated the neurotoxic responses of honeybee/cotton aphid nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to chiral dinotefuran at the enantiomeric scale and demonstrated the microscopic mechanism of species selectivity in nAChR-mediated enantioselective neurotoxicity. The findings indicated that ( S )-dinotefuran had a higher affinity for honeybee nAChR than ( R )-dinotefuran whereas both enantiomers exhibited similar bioactivity toward cotton aphid nAChR. The results of dynamic neurotoxic processes indicated the association of conformational changes induced by chiral dinotefuran with its macroscopic neurotoxicity, and ( R )-dinotefuran, which exhibit low toxicity to honeybee, was found to induce significant conformational changes in the enantioselective neurotoxic reaction, as supported by the average root -meansquare fluctuation (0.35 nm).

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7–2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to α8 subunit of nAChR of Apis mellifera. The α8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations. © 2019 The Authors",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.048,130,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067030671&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2019.05.048&partnerID=40&md5=34ecfc9dc6470b6f2a0d591bc7f7df71,Scopus,,,0,,1,24

Circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important role in the regulation of multiple biological and pathological processes; however, its role in the honey bee brain after exposure to dinotefuran is not well understood. Here, the expression profiles and potential modulation networks of circRNAs in the brains of workers (Apis mellifera) were comprehensively investigated using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 33, 144, and 211 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs were identified on the 1st, 5th and 10th days after exposure to dinotefuran, respectively.

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system. Disturbed energy production may reduce foraging activity and hormonal dysregulation, such as the transition of nurse bees to foragers.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in mediating various biological and pathological processes, involving transcriptional and gene regulation. The effects of dinotefuran on lncRNA expression and lncRNA function in the honey bee brain are still obscure. Results: Through RNA sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed following exposure to 0.01 mg/L dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d. In total, 312 lncRNAs and 1341 mRNAs, 347 lncRNAs and 1458 mRNAs, and 345 lncRNAs and 1155 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the dinotefuran-treated group showed enrichment in carbohydrate and protein metabolism and immune-inflammatory responses such as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and Hippo and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Moreover, the DE lncRNA TCONS_00086519 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may serve as a competing endogenous RNA and a regulatory factor in the immune response to dinotefuran.

The high-throughput small RNA-sequencing was used to analyze global miRNA expression profile changes in honeybees orally exposed to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid (20 mg/L and 4 mg/L) for 72 h. Thiacloprid at 20 mg/L had no observed adverse effects. In addition, bees were fed with miRNA mimics or inhibitors to increase or decrease ame-miR-283–5p expression, and its effects on P450 gene expression (CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3) were examined. Thiacloprid susceptibility was also detected. The results showed that treatment with thiacloprid at 20 mg/L and 4 mg/L induced 11 and five differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the DEMs are mainly involved in the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, nerve conduction, and behavior. ame-miR-283–5p was downregulated by both concentrations, which was validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis. Enhancing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly inhibited CYP9Q2 mRNA and protein expression, and increased thiacloprid toxicity, while reducing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly promoted CYP9Q2 expression, and decreased thiacloprid susceptibility.

The presence of these P450s, belonging or closely related to the CYP9Q subfamily (CYP9Q-related), is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees. However, the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, lacks CYP9Q-related P450s and is 170–2500 times more sensitive to certain insecticides than bee pollinators with these P450s. The extent to which these findings apply to other Megachilidae bee species remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four Megachile species and leveraged the data obtained, in combination with publicly available genomic data, to investigate the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae. Our analyses reveal that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-related genes. In place of these genes Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage. Functional expression of these P450s from M. rotundata reveal they lack the capacity to metabolize the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In contrast, species from the Osmiini and Dioxyini tribes of Megachilidae have CYP9Q-related P450s belonging to the CYP9BU subfamily that are able to detoxify thiacloprid.

The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

The open reading frames of the four genes are 1263 to 1608 bp in length and encode four predicted polypeptides of 499 to 517 amino acids in length. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that expression of all four genes was observed in all developmental stages. In addition, Western blot assays further indicated the RT-qPCR results that showed that the four genes were induced by pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, dichlorovos, and paraquat) treatments. Furthermore, we also used double-stranded RNA-mediated RNA interference to investigate the functions of Acc301A1, Acc303A1,and Acc306A1 in the antioxidant defense of honeybees.

Studies have found that these enzymes show peroxidase-like activity and may thus be involved in protecting organisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491 by in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 degrees C), heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and phoxim) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress.

Insect metamorphosis and response to external stress are altered by deleting CYP450 genes. In this study, we identified and analyzed a novel gene of CYP450 family, AccCYP6A13, from Apis cerana cerana, and explored its role in the response of Apis cerana cerana to adverse external stressors. It was found that the expression of AccCYP6A13 was spatiotemporal specificity. The expression level increased with age and reached its highest value in the adult stage. The primarily expressiong location were legs, brain, and epidermis of honeybees. Stress conditions can affect the expression of AccCYP6A13 depending on treatment times. RNA interference experiments have shown that knocking down AccCYP6A13 reduces antioxidant activity and deactivates detoxification enzymes, resulting in oxidative damage accumulation and a decline in detoxification capability in bees, as well as inhibiting numerous antioxidant genes. Additionally, knockdown of the AccCYP6A13 gene in Apis cerana cerana resulted in increased sensitivity to pesticides and increased mortality when treated with neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam. AccCYP6A13 overexpression in a prokaryotic system further confirmed its role in resistance to oxidative stress. To summarize, AccCYP6A13 may play an essential role in the normal development and response to environmental stress in Apis cerana cerana.

Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples. Together, these data suggest that AcceFE4 may be involved in the oxidative resistance response during adverse stress.

However, recent researcprovides evidence of the negative effects of this and its possible influence on the deterioration of the health of pollinators. Durinthe experiment, mixed-age worker bees of A. mellifera were exposed to a single, sublethal oral dose of flupyradifurone (645 ngbee) and were assessed only for the first day after exposure to 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours. Using reverse transcriptase polymeraschain reaction (RT-qPCR), the alteration in gene expression caused by exposure to this insecticide was quantified. A total of fiv genes were quantified: three primary antioxidant genes (Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and Thioredoxin dismutase (Trxr1), one detoxification gene (Cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3)) and one gene with neuronal activity (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE1). The endogenous ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) gene allowed the estimation of relative gene expression as the response to insecticide exposure. The AChE1 gene was overexpressed up to six hours after exposure; the remaining CYP9Q3, CAT, SOD1, and Trxr1 genes presented a similar behavior.

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. © 2019 by the authors.",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074627857&doi=10.3390%2finsects10110382&partnerID=40&md5=1d7cd991c5dc71ff1cccacd749911b7f,Scopus,,,0,,1,40
202,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/food–oral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not host–pathogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey bees’ innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,0,,1,41

However, the molecular bases mediated at the gene level remain to be discovered. Here, we found four heat shock protein DnaJB subfamily genes, DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14, from Apis cerana cerana, that all have J domains in their protein sequences. The expression levels of DnaJB6 and DnaJshv were upregulated by different degrees of heat stress, and the transcript level of DnaJB14 was gradually upregulated as the degree of heat stress increased, while the mRNA level of DnaJB13 was downregulated at multiple time points during heat stress treatment. The mRNA levels of all four DnaJBs were upregulated by cold and UV stress. In addition, the expression levels of DnaJB6, DnaJshv and DnaJB13 were reduced under abamectin, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl stresses. The transcript level of DnaJB14 was decreased by imidacloprid, cypermethrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl exposure but increased by abamectin and bifenthrin exposure. These results indicate that the demand of A. cerana cerana for these four DnaJBs differs under various stress conditions. To further explore the role of DnaJBs in the stress response, we successfully silenced DnaJshv and DnaJB14. The content of protein carbonyl was increased, while the content of VC, the enzymatic activities of CAT, GST, and SOD, the mRNA levels of many antioxidant-related genes, and the total antioxidant capacity were reduced after knockdown of DnaJshv and DnaJB14 in A. cerana cerana.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14 are differentially expressed under stress conditions and play crucial roles in response to various stressors, possibly through the antioxidant signalling pathway.

The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mga.i./L L- cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees.

However, little is known about the physiological effects of sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate exposure on bumblebees. We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5 mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10 days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, α-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut α-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activity of prophenoloxidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition.

In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. © 2021 by the authors.

The main objective of the present study was to design and apply an integrative protocol to monitor honeybee colony activity and sample collection by using electronic technologies combined with classical methods in order to evaluate the exposure of honeybees to the neonicotinoids that are used in melliferous intensive crops. The monitored honeybee colonies were especially prepared and equipped to maximize their chances to collect representative samples in order to express, as well as possible, the pesticide residues that existed in the targeted crops. The samples of honey, pollen and honeybees were collected, preserved and prepared to fulfill the required quality and quantity criteria of the accredited laboratories. In total, a set of fifty samples was collected from fields, located in different areas of intensive agriculture in Romania, and was analyzed for five neonicotinoids. The obtained results show that 48% of the total analyzed samples (n = 50) contained one or more detected or quantified neonicotinoid residues. The main conclusion is that the proposed approach for sample collection and preparation could improve the evaluation methodologies for analyzing honeybees' exposure to pesticides. © 2020 by the authors.",2020///,2020,10.3390/d12010024,12,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078673504&doi=10.3390%2fd12010024&partnerID=40&md5=465c1ab9ed05486a8dd0c40aa915d579,Scopus,,,1,,0,46
69,JOUR,Use of double-stranded RNA targeting β2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit to control pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum at larval and adult stages,"['Ligonniere, S', 'Raymond, V', 'Goven, D']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of the RNA interference technology (RNAi) has emerged as one of the new strategies for species-specific control of insect pests. Its specificity depends on the distinctiveness of the target gene sequence for a given species. In this work, we assessed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (A. pisum) the use of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets the beta 2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (dsRNA-beta 2), which shares low sequence identity with other subunits, to control populations of this pest at different developmental stages. Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

The Lineweaver-Burk reciprocal plots for acetamiprid shows unchanged Vmax and increased Km values with inhibitor concentrations, while analysis of Michaelis-Menten plots shows predominantly competitive mechanism. The inhibition constant value (Ki = 24.3 μM) indicates strong binding of the acetamiprid complex to AChE. Finally, the four tested neonicotinoids are not a uniform group regarding their blocking ability.

80,JOUR,A sublethal dose of neonicotinoid imidacloprid precisely sensed and detoxified by a C-minus odorant-binding protein 17 highly expressed in the legs of Apis cerana,"['Qiu, Y.-L.', 'Wu, F.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Jiang, H.-Q.', 'Chen, J.-T.', 'Pan, Y.-J.', 'Li, H.-L.']",Science of the Total Environment,"As a native honeybee species in East Asia, Apis cerana is essential for the stability of local agricultural and plant ecosystems by its' olfactory system for searching nectar and pollen sources. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 × 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana. Also, our research enriches the theoretical knowledge of the sensing and detoxifying activities of non-target insects' olfactory sensory system to environmental sublethal doses of systemic insecticides. © 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163762,885,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156209707&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163762&partnerID=40&md5=b7a0042081a3f20bd2f0f0a184431246,Scopus,"['amino acid sequence', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'Animals', 'Apis cerana', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'binding affinity', 'binding assay', 'Binding energy', 'Biochemistry', 'chemistry', 'clinical article', 'crystal structure', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'East Asia', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrophysiology', 'enthalpy', 'entropy', 'expression vector', 'fluorescence', 'fragrance', 'gene expression', 'gene sequence', 'honeybee', 'human', 'hydrogen bond', 'Hydrogen bonds', 'hydrophobicity', 'Hydrophobicity', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'low temperature', 'melphalan', 'metabolism', 'molecular cloning', 'molecular docking', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'odorant-binding protein', 'Odorant-binding protein', 'Odorant-binding proteins', 'olfactory system', 'Olfactory systems', 'pheromone', 'Pheromones', 'physiological response', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollution exposure', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA interference', 'RNAi', 'Semiochemicals', 'sequence analysis', 'spatiotemporal analysis', 'spectrofluorometry', 'static electricity', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'Temperature', 'theoretical study', 'Thermoanalysis', 'thermodynamics', 'Thermodynamics', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'Van der Waals forces']",,0,,0,50

Then, the mechanisms of bi-directional selective toxic effects and drug resistance were determined using homology modeling and molecular docking analyses. The results of the model showed that the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 12- positions of neonicotinoid insecticides strongly affected their toxicity, and that the introduction of bulky or electropositive groups at these positions could increase the pLC50 values. Using Compound 19 as a template, we designed 37 derivatives with greater toxicity (increased by 0.04–11.45%). Among them, 20 derivatives had bioconcentrations lower than that of Compound 19 (reduced by 0.38–147.88%). Further screening of Compound 19 and the 20 derivatives mentioned above by homology modeling and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) molecular docking analyses showed that 10 derivatives had bi-directional selective toxic effects against pests and bees. Further docking analyses of Compound 19 and these 10 derivatives identified that Derivative-33 showed decreased docking with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S transferase (GST) in pests and enhanced docking with these enzymes in bees, indicating bi-directional selective resistance for pests and bees. Accordingly, Derivative-33 was selected as a new insecticide with high toxicity to pests and low toxicity to bees (bi-directional selective toxicity), low resistance in pest populations, and high resistance in bee populations.

This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UV–visible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's α-helix content, suggesting structural alterations. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further elucidate the binding modes and stability of these interactions, highlighting the role of specific amino acids in CSP3's binding cavity.

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding. This research sheds light on pesticides′ probable inhibitory effects on SDH, a vital enzyme in honey bee energy production and mitochondrial function.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations.

Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016/12/01/,2016,10.1038/srep38110,6,,2045-2322,WOS:000389659800001,,,,,,,0,,0,57

Honeybees were treated orally with 100 μg of 14C-imidacloprid per kg of bee, a dose close to the median lethal dose. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity in honeybee was 25 h. Haemolymph was the compartment with the lowest and rectum that with the highest level of total radioactivity during the whole study, with a maximum 24 h after treatment. Elimination half-life of imidacloprid in whole honeybee was 5 h. Imidacloprid was readily distributed and metabolised only by Phase I enzymes into five metabolites: 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxy- imidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and olefin and urea derivatives. The guanidine derivative was not detected. The urea derivative and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the main metabolites and appeared particularly in midgut and rectum. The olefin derivative and 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid preferentially occurred in head, thorax and abdomen, which are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues. Moreover, they presented a peak value around 4 h after imidacloprid ingestion. These results explain the prolongation of imidacloprid action in bees, and particularly the differences between rapid intoxication symptoms and late mortality. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",2004///,2004,10.1002/ps.895,60,11,,,1056,1062,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-7044262772&doi=10.1002%2fps.895&partnerID=40&md5=1f8619ba770abffb7b8c4b1c22c214bf,Scopus,,,0,,0,58

The insecticidal bioactivities against cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora) and the bee toxicities of these compounds are tested. Some of the title compounds present good insecticidal activities against cowpea aphid. The results also show that some of the title compounds exhibit lower bee toxicity than that of C-29 and imidacloprid.

A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before. This study may benefit to evaluate the effect of neonicotinoid insecticides on the olfactory cognitive behavior of bees involved in the crops pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulators of gene expression. In this study, we initially determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of dinotefuran was 0.773 mg/l. Then, the expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in honey bee brains after 1, 5, and 10 d of treatment with the lethal concentration 10 (LC10) of dinotefuran were explored via deep small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 2, 23, and 27 DE miRNAs were identified after persistent exposure to the LC10 of dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d, respectively.

[Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. It is likely that the vast majority of mass pesticide kills of beneficial insects across other environments go unnoticed and unreported. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In the present study, the effects of chronic FPF exposure on bees were systematically investigated at the individual behavioral, tissue, cell, enzyme activity, and the gene expression levels. Chronic exposure (14 d) to FPF led to reduced survival (12 mg/L), body weight gain (4 and 12 mg/L), and food utilization efficiency (4 and 12 mg/L). Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis. FPF exposure (4 and 12 mg/L) led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activity.

Honeybees were treated orally with 100 μg [14C]-acetamiprid kg-1 bee, a dose which is about 1500 times lower than the median lethal dose. After 72 h, only 40% of the total radioactivity was eliminated, suggesting that acetamiprid and its metabolites tended to persist in the honeybee. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed in all compartments and metabolized. Just after administration, radioactivity was mainly localized in the abdomen and subsequently in the rectum. After 72 h, the maximum amount of radioactivity (about 20% of the ingested dose) was detected again in the abdomen, whereas the lowest level of total radioactivity was detected in the haemolymph. Radioactivity in the head did not exceed 7.6% of total ingested radioactivity. More than 50% of acetamiprid was metabolised in less than 30 min, indicating a very short half-life for the compound.

Previous reports have demonstrated the toxicity of this drug in activating oxidative stress resulting in high mortality in the honey bee Apis mellifera. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid have not been fully elucidated. In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload.

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data.

Within this study, an OBP gene (AccOBP10) was isolated and identified from A. c. cerana. Both homology and phylogenetic relationship analyses indicated that the amino acid sequence of AccOBP10 had a high degree of sequence identity with other members of the gene family. Analysis of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that AccOBP10 mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the venom gland than in other tissues. The mRNA transcript expression of AccOBP10 was upregulated by low temperature (4 degrees C), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), pyridaben, methomyl and imidacloprid but downregulated by heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet light, vitamin C, mercuric chloride, cadmium chloride, paraquat and phoxim. Expression of AccOBP10 under abiotic stress was analysed by western blotting, and the results were consistent with those of qRT-PCR. And as a further study of AccOBP10 function, we demonstrated that knockdown of AccOBP10 by RNA interference could slightly increase the expression levels of some stress-related genes.

130,JOUR,"New approaches to old problems: Removal of phospholipase A2 results in highly active microsomal membranes from the honey bee, Apis mellifera","['Zaworra, M.', 'Nauen, R.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Over the last 50 years numerous studies were published by insect toxicologists using native microsomal membrane preparations in order to investigate in vitro cytochrome P450-(P450) mediated oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics, including insecticides. Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites. Our work provides access to a new and simple in vitro tool to study honey bee phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics utilising the entire range of microsomal cytochrome P450s. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.014,161,,,,68,76,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065084111&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.04.014&partnerID=40&md5=fcecb464371b44cff9d79558f095a6dd,Scopus,,,0,,0,74

Here, we report the identification and characterization of two genes, designated AccGtpx-1 and AccGtpx-2, encoding PHGPX proteins from the Chinese honeybees, Apis cerana cerana. Alignment analysis showed that AccGtpx-1 and AccGtpx-2 shared high similarity with other known PHGPXs, which show similar structure to thioredoxin. These single copy genes showed complex exon-intron structures. The mRNA of AccGtpx-1 was detected in larvae, pupae and adults and that AccGtpx-2 was only found in adult worker bees. Furthermore, the expression of AccGtpx-1 could be induced by H2O2, ultraviolet (UV) light, heat shock (37 degrees C), HgCl2, imidacloprid, cyhalothrin, pyriproxyfen and methomyl. In contrast, AccGtpx-2 expression could only be induced by UV.

119,JOUR,Characterisation of the heat shock protein Tid and its involvement in stress response regulation in Apis cerana,"['Li, G.', 'Zhang, C.', 'Wang, H.', 'Xia, W.', 'Zhang, X.', 'Liu, Z.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Zhao, H.', 'Xu, B.']",Frontiers in Physiology,"Objective: The impact of various environmental stresses on native Apis cerana cerana fitness has attracted intense attention in China. However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT–PCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40°C to 43°C and 46°C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown. Conclusion: AccTid plays a crucial role in A. cerana cerana stress responses and may mediate oxidative damage caused by various stresses. Our findings will offer fundamental knowledge for further investigations of the defence mechanism of A. cerana cerana against environmental stresses.

118,JOUR,Characteristics of AccSTIP1 in Apis cerana cerana and its role during oxidative stress responses,"['Zhai, N', 'Jia, HH', 'Ma, ML', 'Chao, YZ', 'Guo, XQ', 'Li, H']",CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES,"Various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, heavy metals, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and different pesticides, induce a cellular oxidative stress response. The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 degrees C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AccSTIP1 plays an important role in counteracting oxidative stress.

Multiple factors like parasites, pathogens and pesticides are dealt as possible drivers of honeybee losses. In particular, insecticides are considered as a major factor of pollinator poisoning. We applied sublethal concentrations of four insecticidal substances to honeybee larval food and analyzed the effects on transcriptome. The aim was to identify candidate genes indicating early negative impacts after application of insecticidal substances. Honeybee larvae were kept in-vitro under hive conditions (34–35 °C) and fed with dimethoate, fenoxycarb, chlorantraniliprole and flupyradifurone in sublethal concentrations between day 3–6 after grafting. Larvae at day 4, 6 and 8 were sampled and their transcriptome analyzed. By use of a RT-qPCR array differences in gene expression of selected gene families (immune system, development detoxification) were measured.

210,JOUR,Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 µL for honeybees and to 2 µL for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower for the red mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. © 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,0,,0,79
166,JOUR,A Vitellogenin Antibody in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera): Characterization and Application as Potential Biomarker for Insecticide Exposure,"['Christen, V.', 'Vogel, M.S.', 'Hettich, T.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The insect yolk precursor vitellogenin is a lipoglycoprotein synthesized and stored in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph. In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees.

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters.

Here, multiple fluorescence spectra, thermodynamic method, and molecular docking were used to study the interaction and the functional inhibition of imidacloprid to the recombinant CSP1 protein in Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity (λem = 332 nm) of CSP1 could be significantly quenched by imidacloprid in a dynamic mode. During the quenching process, ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, indicating that the acting forces of imidacloprid with CSP1 are mainly hydrophobic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the binding process. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the α-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain. In addition, the binding of CSP1 to floral scent β-ionone was inhibited by nearly 50% of the apparent association constant (KA) in the presence of 0.28–2.53 ng/bee of imidacloprid, and the inhibition rate of nearly 95% at 3.75 ng/bee of imidacloprid at sublethal dose level.

However, the lipids of their central nervous system have not been examined, even though they likely play a crucial role in the performance of cognitive process to perform intricate behaviors. Lipidomics has greatly advanced our understanding of neuropathologies in mammals and could provide the same for honey bees. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the brain lipidome of adult honey bees and to assess the effect of clothianidin (a neurotoxic insecticide) on the brain lipid composition, gene expression, and performance of self-grooming behavior under controlled conditions (cage experiments). Methods: After seven days of exposure to oral sublethal doses of clothianidin, the bees were assessed for self-grooming behavior; their brains were dissected to analyze the lipidome using an untargeted lipidomics approach and to perform a high throughput RNAseq analysis. Results: Compared to all other organisms, healthy bee brain lipidomes contain unusually high levels of alkyl-ether linked (plasmanyl) phospholipids (51.42%) and low levels of plasmalogens (plasmenyl phospholipids; 3.46%). This could make it more susceptible to the effects of toxins in the environment. A positive correlation between CL 18:3/18:1/14:0/22:6, TG 6:0/11:2/18:1, LPE 18:0e and intense self-grooming was found. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid altered PC 20:3e/15:0, PC 16:0/18:3, PA 18:0/24:1, and TG 18:1/18:1/18/1 levels, and affected gene expression linked to GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and energy metabolism that may be partially responsible for the altered lipid composition. Conclusion: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral disorders. © 2022",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jare.2021.08.007,37,,,,75,89,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113674681&doi=10.1016%2fj.jare.2021.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=3402264eaea4aabfd4c6f44eec4b5507,Scopus,"['Brain', 'Grooming', 'Honey bees', 'Lipidome', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Social immunity']",,0,,0,90

203,JOUR,A novel insecticide impairs bumblebee memory and sucrose responsiveness across high and low nutrition,"Gray, L.K.; Hulsey, M.; Siviter, H.",Royal Society Open Science,"Wild bees are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers but are exposed to a myriad of different anthropogenic stressors, such as pesticides and poor nutrition, as a consequence of intensive agriculture. These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'.

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2× deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Our findings suggest that additivity is a good baseline for predicting the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to bees, and that the rare cases of synergy of pesticide mixtures to bees are not random but have a mechanistic basis. © 2022 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159518,857,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140783605&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.159518&partnerID=40&md5=6f800aae18835c979ed4c168161574ac,Scopus,"['acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'additive', 'Additive effects', 'Additives', 'additivity', 'Additivity', 'additivity effect', 'additivity predictions', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'biological activity', 'clothianidin', 'coefficient of variation', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration addition', 'Concentration addition', 'concentration addition model', 'cyfluthrin', 'cyhalothrin', 'cypermethrin', 'deltamethrin', 'endosulfan', 'ethiprole', 'etofenprox', 'experimental cumulative distribution function', 'experimental design', 'experimental toxicity', 'exposure route', 'exposure time', 'fenpropidin', 'fipronil', 'fluoxastrobin', 'flupyradifurone', 'Food products', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Honey bee', 'honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'isoflucypram', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'methamidophos', 'methiocarb', 'mixture deviation ratio', 'mixtures', 'Mixtures', 'non additive effects', 'Non-additive', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'pesticides', 'Pesticides', 'physical parameters', 'prevalence', 'probability', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'spiromesifen', 'spirotetramat', 'spiroxamine', 'synergistic effect', 'synergy', 'Synergy', 'tebuconazole', 'tetraniliprole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiodicarb', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicological parameters', 'transfluthrin', 'triadimenol', 'unclassified drug']",,0,,0,94

While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid – IMI or thiamethoxam – THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), α-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (α-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin) and α-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees. This would merit further investigation as these compounds are important in various aspects of bees’ health.

Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration.

The new insecticide flupyradifurone, and the microplastics in the environment, have raised significant concerns on bee health. This study evaluated the simultaneous effects of microplastics, flupyradifurone, and N. ceranae on honey bee health, focusing on survival rates, N. ceranae replication, daily food consumption, and bee midgut histological alterations. Results showed a significant decrease in bee longevity across all treatments compared to the control, with the combination of flupyradifurone, microplastics, and N. ceranae having the most severe impact. Microplastics and flupyradifurone exposure also increased N. ceranae proliferation, especially in bees subjected to both stressors. Histological analysis revealed reduced regenerative cell nests in the midgut and changes in the nuclear matrix, indicating stress responses.

Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)), then compared these RQs to a level of concern. For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees. Further studies are recommended for more comprehensive risk assessments to nontargets from neonicotinoid use for SLF management. © The Author(s) 2023.

Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure. Within the first day after application of FPF, mortality of bees feeding on buckwheat was 29 times higher compared with control treatments, while mortality of FPF exposed and control bees was similar in the other two plant species. Moreover, we found negative synergistic impacts of FPF and nutritional stress on offspring production, flight activity, flight duration and flower visitation frequency.

Exposure to multiple factors including pesticides like imidacloprid and amitraz may negatively alter their immune response and ultimately make them more susceptible to diseases.

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-72041-3,10,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093829332&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-72041-3&partnerID=40&md5=a24ef869a003dc0e843503bf437dbbbc,Scopus,"['animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'circadian rhythm', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'honey', 'Honey', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory', 'Memory', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic agent', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'sleep', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Navigation', 'spatial orientation']",,0,,0,106

As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133,140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,0,,0,108

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure.

In this study, we examined their toxicities of binary, ternary, quaternary, quinquenary, senary, septenary and octonary mixtures to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) with feeding toxicity test. Results showed that EMB and ABA had the highest toxicities to A. mellifera with LC50 values of 0.033 (0.028–0.038) and 0.047 (0.039–0.056) μg a. i. mL−1 after exposure for 7 days, respectively, followed by DIC with an LC50 value of 1.22 (1.01–1.41) μg a. i. mL−1.

Firstly, the main insecticides for three stages of cotton growth were identified under the lateral mixing condition. Insecticides for the first phase included abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b), acetamiprid (N-(N-cyano-ethylimine)-N-methyl-2-chloropyridine-5-methylamine), dicofol (1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol) and cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester); the insecticides available in the second phase included cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), phoxim (O,O-diethyl-O-α-cyanophenylbenzylamine thiophosphate ester), deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester)-cyano-diphenyl ether) and abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b). In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicity by 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%.

9,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. © 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118699937&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100051&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0e1bc03406e457bd1eb4d83cd26b7,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'Associative learning', 'Clothianidin', 'EMF', 'Flight']",,0,,0,119

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes.

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,0,,0,121

Over three years, we assessed the ecotoxicological impacts on the diversity and abundance of bees and syrphid flies between reduced-risk pesticide programs and standard, conventional pesticide programs in paired plots at six spatially distinct commercial apple orchards. In particular, we quantified pesticide inputs, environmental impact, and community response of bees and syrphids to these pesticide programs. Relative environmental impacts of reduced-risk versus conventional pesticide programs were calculated using Environmental Impact Quotient analysis, while ecological impacts were characterized by assessing the abundance, richness, and species assemblages of bees and syrphids. Adopting a reduced-risk pesticide program for apple pest management reduced the use (in terms of kg a.i./ha) of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides by approximately 97.6% and 100% respectively, but increased the use of neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid) by 40.4% compared to the orchards under standard conventional pesticide program. Regardless of pesticide inputs, abundance, richness and species assemblages of bees and syrphids did not differ between reduced-risk and conventional pest management programs. However, the environmental impact of pesticide inputs was reduced by 89.8% in reduced-risk pesticide program. These findings suggest that the implementation of reduced-risk pesticide program may reduce pesticide environmental impact, in addition to being safer to farm workers, without adversely affecting the robust community composition of bees and syrphids in commercial apple orchards in the mid-Atlantic region.

Honeybees were treated orally with imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg-1 bee. Imidacloprid was metabolised relatively quickly and thoroughly. Twenty minutes after the beginning of imidacloprid ingestion, the sum of the residues from the three compounds amounted to only 70% of the actual given dose. Imidacloprid, 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin represented, respectively, 50%, 9% and 8% of the actual ingested dose. Six and 24h, respectively, after ingestion of imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg -1 bee, imidacloprid could no longer be detected in the honeybee. Imidacloprid had a half-life ranging between 4.5 and 5h and was rapidly metabolised into 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin. Except 5-hydroxyimidacloprid in the 20 μg kg-1 treatment, these two metabolites presented a peak value 4h after ingestion of the 20 and 50 μg kg-1 doses. This time fully coincided with the appearance of mortality induced by imidacloprid after acute oral intoxication. These results suggested that the immediate neurotoxicity symptoms are due to the action of imidacloprid, whereas 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and/or olefin are involved in honeybee mortality. In addition, it was likely that the 30% of residues undetected 20min after intoxication were imidacloprid metabolites, although not 5-hydroxyimidacloprid or olefin.

Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not.

206,JOUR,Sub-lethal but potentially devastating - The novel insecticide flupyradifurone impairs collective brood care in bumblebees,"Fischer, L.R.; Ramesh, D.; Weidenmüller, A.",Science of the Total Environment,"The worldwide decline in pollinating insects is alarming. One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. © 2023 The Authors",2023,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168103283&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166097&partnerID=40&md5=71fd9fafbe9b7749bcfa557154545900,,agriculture; Agriculture; animal experiment; animal parameters; animal tissue; anthropogenic effect; Anthropogenics; Apis; Article; Assessment procedure; bee; Bombus terrestris; Brood development; brood temperature; bumblebee; collective brood care; Collective thermoregulation; colony growth; Colony growth; controlled study; dietary exposure; flupyradifurone; glyphosate; herbicide; Herbicides; insecticide; Insecticides; Microcolonies; Mortality rate; nonhuman; organism colony; Parasite-; pesticide; Pesticides; Pollinator crisis; risk assessment; Risk assessment; Risks assessments; temperature; thermoregulation; unclassified drug,,0,,0,128
174,JOUR,Digestion dynamics of acetamiprid during royal jelly formation and exposure risk assessment to honeybee larva based on processing factor,"['Jiang, P.', 'Zhang, S.', 'Chai, Y.', 'He, Q.', 'Gao, Q.', 'Xiao, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Cao, H.']",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,"Previous studies to the exposure effects of acetamiprid on honeybees were based on the analysis of bee pollen and honey sacs from field trials or of beebread and honey in the hive, which overestimate or underestimate the risk of exposure to pesticide residues. It was believed that the processing factor (PF) is an important variable to determine the final pesticide residue during royal jelly formation and the actual risk to honeybee larva. Hence, a QuEChERS method to determine acetamiprid contents in honeybee samples was established in this study. Then, the PFs for acetamiprid in beebread fermentation, honey brewing, and royal jelly formation were determined to be 0.85, 0.76, and 0.16, respectively. The PF for royal jelly formation was 0.04 when acetamiprid was detected in beebread alone, and it was 0.12 when acetamiprid was only detected in honey. Finally, the predicted exposure concentration of acetamiprid in royal jelly was calculated to be 2.05 µg/kg using the PF without significant difference with the 90th percentile value (3.64 µg/kg) in the actual sample. However, the value was 16.62 µg/kg without considering the PF.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an important pollinator, an object of human economic activity and a bioindicator of environmental pollution. Insecticides used in Agriculture for treatment of plants, bee colonies, and farm animals may be dangerous for bees. This paper reports the results of a comparative assessment of the acute contact toxicity of four toxic bait formulations designed for insect pest control on livestock farms to the honeybees. Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions. The future semi-field and field studies are needed to evaluate the possible exposure and the hazard degree of insecticidal baits for bees under conditions close to practice use of these formulations.",2018///,2018,10.15421/2018_289,8,1,2520-2138,WOS:000429918700109,887,891,,,,,0,,0,130

Imidacloprid (IMD), belonging to Neonicotinoids class, is widely used as a powerful insecticide but generating important negative effects on honey bees. The current study investigated the direct effect of IMD on bee spermatozoa. The experimental design consisted of in vitro co-incubation of bee gametes with three different concentrations of IMD 1, 10, and 25 μM for 15 min. Conventional microscopic and Computer-aided sperm analyses (CASA) were concomitantly used with a dual goal: to evaluate objectively the effects of IMD on sperm parameters on the one hand and to report computer kinematic parameters in the control group, without IMD treatment, on the other hand. The results revealed apparent negative effects in a dose-dependent manner with motility collapsing completely at 25 μM of IMD. The current results highlighted the direct impact of IMD on bee spermatozoa and revealing the potential subsequent effects on bee reproduction. This study reported also drone computer sperm parameters that could serve as a reference in the studied region. Bee sperm velocities showed the lowest values ever reported in the different animal species. The CASA system appeared as objective and a sensitive method to detect subtle toxic effects on bee sperm, and this opens real perspectives particularly in studying existing correlations between CASA parameters and fertility outputs of different environmentally toxic molecules. © 2020, © 2020 International Bee Research Association.",2020///,2020,10.1080/00218839.2020.1775017,59,4,,,343,349,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087150975&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2020.1775017&partnerID=40&md5=c65dd0a62ab80542ca952e7c4d6790a1,Scopus,"['CASA system', 'drone', 'in\xa0vitro', 'pesticides', 'spermatozoa']",,0,,0,131

Results showed that high concentrations of chlorpyrifos, malathion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and pirimiphos-methyl were detected in midgut at locations with extensive pesticide spraying. Reduced glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase displayed lowest activities in the heavily sprayed location (Tiba). Lipid peroxidation level in the midgut of honeybees in the sprayed locations was found to be significantly higher compared to the reference values. Meanwhile, various ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in the epithelial cells of midgut of honeybees collected from El Kaza and Tiba, included confluent and disorganized microvilli and destruction of their brush border, the cytoplasm with large vacuoles and alteration of cytoplasmic organelles including the presence of swollen mitochondria with lysis of matrices, disruption of limiting membranes, and disintegration of cristae. The nuclei with indented nuclear envelope and disorganized chromatin were observed.

Currently, the number of pollinators is decreasing worldwide, which is attributed mostly to the widespread use of pesticides. The aim of this work was to develop a method for assessing the genotoxicity of pesticides for the Bombus terrestris L. bumblebee using long-range PCR of mitochondrial DNA fragments. We have developed a panel of primers and assessed the genotoxicity of the following pesticides: imidacloprid, rotenone, deltamethrin, difenocanozole, malathion, metribuzin, penconazole, esfenvalerate, and dithianon. All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA. The mtDNA damage was observed for all studied pesticides. Most of the studied pesticides caused significant damage to mtDNA in vitro and in vivo when ingested. Our results indicate that all tested pesticides, including herbicides and fungicides, can have a toxic effect on pollinators. However, the extent of pesticide-induced mtDNA damage in the flight muscles was significantly less upon the contact compared to the oral administration. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104675,169,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089444308&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.104675&partnerID=40&md5=165343f8a589c2deeac699de35290eee,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bumblebees', 'DNA damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Long-range PCR', 'Method', 'Mitochondria', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mitochondrion', 'mtDNA', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollination', 'Pollination']",,0,,0,133

Images are continuously acquired at the beehive entrance, and the honey bees in the images are segmented and detected using the background subtraction method. Tracking of honey bees is achieved using an integrated Kalman Filter and Hungarian algorithm tracking method. The tracking algorithm was used to determine the incoming and outgoing activity of individual honey bees with an automatic counting accuracy of 93.9 ± 1.1% in comparison with manual counting. The in-and-out activity and environmental information from sensors were transmitted to a remote server via a 4G LTE router for later analyses. To evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the system, the imaging systems were installed in multiple beehives, and designed experiments were carried out. The experiments involved long-term monitoring to assess the pesticide effects on honey bee behaviors by treating the beehives with different concentrations of imidacloprid pesticides. Using the in-and-out activities information collected, indices were further derived and analyzed. The information obtained from the experiments was used to assess the health conditions of the honey bee colonies monitored. Different measurement results such as hourly and daily frequencies of honey bees’ in-and-out activity under different conditions were presented. The developed imaging system is cost effective and can be used as a useful tool for long-term monitoring of the health and activity of honey bee colonies and to further analyze behavior traits of honey bees. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.compag.2019.05.050,163,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067192625&doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2019.05.050&partnerID=40&md5=f11d5802334b0df88d49827c9c7913b7,Scopus,,,0,,0,135

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybees’ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. © 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,4,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187202591&doi=10.3390%2fani14040608&partnerID=40&md5=bee8613fa13ab09e8899b833165a5703,Scopus,"['animal health and welfare', 'aphid', 'Article', 'bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF)', 'bergamot oil', 'colony forming unit', 'diet supplementation', 'Escherichia coli', 'flupyradifurone', 'food intake', 'honeybee', 'honeybee (Apis mellifera)', 'insecticide', 'intoxication', 'LC50', 'mass spectrometry', 'mortality rate', 'natural products', 'nonhuman', 'pilot study', 'poisoning', 'pollination', 'psyllid', 'Salmonella', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography', 'unclassified drug', 'whitefly']",,0,,0,137

Compared with general grassland conservation practices, wildflower plantings led to only a 5% increase in pollinator diversity and no change in counts regardless of the proportion of cropland agriculture within a 1 km radius. Pollinator diversity increased earlier in the growing season and with per cent flower cover. Unexpectedly, neither insecticide nor total pesticide concentrations on above-ground passive samplers were related to pollinator diversity. However, pollinator community composition was most strongly related to date of sampling, total pesticide concentration, and forb or flower cover.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ≤ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ≤10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,0,,0,141

However, we have previously shown that mitochondrial damage induced by neonicotinoids can be corrected by 670nm light exposure.

We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph.

On the other hand, selectivity is an important characteristic of insecticides, as it makes it possible to lessen impacts oil pollinators and other non-target organisms. We examined the toxicity of various insecticides for honey bees foraging on cotton in a greenhouse, including Turbine (R) 500 WG (150 g ha(-1)) (flonicamid), Actara (R) 250 WG (200 g ha(-1)) (thiamethoxam), Cartap (R) 500 SP (1500 g ha(-1)) (cartap), Talstar (R) 100 CE (1000 mL ha(-1)) (bifenthrin) and Match (R) 50 CE (1000 mL ha(-1)) (lufenuron).

Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict contact acute toxicity (LD50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce. The analysis of the statistical parameters of this model and those published in the literature shows that our model is more efficient. The QSAR model was assessed according to the OECD principles for the validation of QSAR models. The calculated values for the internal and external validation statistic parameters (Q(2) and <(r(m)(2))over bar>are greater than 0.85. In addition to this validation, a mathematical equation derived from the ANN model was used to predict the LD50 of 20 other pesticides. A good correlation between predicted and experimental values was found (R (2) = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.14). As a result, this equation could be a means of predicting the toxicity of new pesticides.",2018/01//,2018,10.1007/s11356-017-0498-9,25,1,0944-1344,WOS:000419608400085,896,907,,,,,0,,0,144

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449,461,,,,,0,,0,145

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees.

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016/04//,2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,2,0022-0493,WOS:000374497000004,515,519,,,,,0,,0,154

The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri.

In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees. Measures should be taken to manage the environmental risk of pesticide adjuvants during the process of formulation development and registration.

178,JOUR,Neonicotinoid contamination in conservation areas affects bees more sharply than beetles,"['Tetlie, J.', 'Harmon-Threatt, A.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The neurotoxic insecticide class of neonicotinoids has become one of the most widely used groups of pesticides globally. Their long half-lives and high water solubility increase their potential to linger and affect numerous organisms long after application. A prominent concern associated with residual contamination is the negative impact that neonicotinoids can have on beneficial arthropods such as bees and certain groups of beetles. Many studies have looked at the effects neonicotinoids have on arthropod communities in lab settings; however, comparatively few studies have looked at these groups in neonicotinoid-contaminated restored prairie habitats. These habitats are often restored from or located near agriculture and are almost ubiquitously contaminated with neonicotinoids. Our one-year manipulated field study compared native bee nesting rates and beetle community assemblages between paired clothianidin-contaminated and non-contaminated restored prairie plots. Native bee nesting probability and nesting abundance increased by 46% and 172%, respectively, in sites contaminated with clothianidin. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in beetle family assemblages, abundance, or richness between clothianidin-contaminated and control sites. These results suggest that neonicotinoid contamination of natural habitats can have numerous environmental consequences for arthropods and that these effects are not always consistent between taxa. Understanding how neonicotinoid contamination affects beneficial groups such as bees and arthropod community assemblages is crucial for characterizing the risks these chemicals pose to ecologically imperative taxa.

This study investigated bee genera diversity and abundance in blueberry fields produced under organic certification programs, conventionally produced Concord juice and wine grape vineyards, conventionally produced spearmint and peppermint fields, and conventionally produced hopyards. The majority of bees found in the study were ground-nesting. Mint fields had the highest pollinator abundance and richness.

In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicities of CYA and SUL on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae reared in vitro. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the median lethal dose (LD50): CYA 0.007, 0.014, 0.028, 0.056 and 0.112 μg larva−1; SUL 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg larva−1. In the chronic toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the LD50: CYA 0.00512, 0.0128, 0.032, 0.08 and 0.2 μg larva−1; SUL 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 μg larva−1. The acute LD50 values of CYA and SUL were 0.047 and 11.404 μg larva−1, respectively. Larvae acutely exposed to SUL had significantly lower body weight than controls, but those exposed to CYA showed no difference. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and LD50 values of the chronic toxicity tests for each insecticide were 0.00512 and 0.064 μg larva−1 for CYA, and 0.0625 μg larva−1 and 0.212 μg larva−1 for SUL, respectively. Larvae chronically exposed to SUL emerged as bees with deformed wings, reaching adult deformation rates of over 50%; however, CYA had no effect on adult deformation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to CYA increased larval mortality but did not cause any adult deformation, whereas SUL exposure increased pupal mortality and caused wing deformation in newly emerged bees.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that simultaneous exposure to DMT and FLU doses has on bee health. Groups of twenty honeybees were housed in cages to compose six macro-groups. One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticides’ interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for up to three days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day. When DMT and FLU 50 were administered together, the group that received DMT alone had a lower survival rate. When comparing the survival rates produced by the DMT and FLU 50 combination to those of the group receiving FLU 50 alone, the same was clearly visible. While there was no statistically significant improvement observed when the survival indices of the DMT and FLU 100 combination were compared to those of the group intoxicated with DMT alone, an improvement in survival indices was observed when these were compared with the group intoxicated with FLU 100 alone. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024,10.3390/ani14060851,14,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188842192&doi=10.3390%2fani14060851&partnerID=40&md5=daea9e86a4f794dca079f939b6438c45,,abnormal behavior; adult; animal experiment; animal health and welfare; animal model; antagonism; antagonistic effect; Article; beekeeping; deltamethrin; drug interaction; environment; flupyradifurone; food intake; honeybee; honeybee (Apis mellifera); in vitro study; intoxication; nonhuman; pest control; pesticide; pesticides; plant pest control; plants; survival rate; unclassified drug,,0,,0,162

The loss of pollinating insects is of particular concern because of the ecological and economic values these species provide. The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was once common in western North America, but this species has become increasingly rare through much of its range. To understand potential mechanisms driving these declines, we used Bayesian occupancy models to investigate the effects of climate and land cover from 1998 to 2020, pesticide use from 2008 to 2014, and projected expected occupancy under three future scenarios. Using 14,457 surveys across 2.8 million km2 in the western United States, we found strong negative relationships between increasing temperature and drought on occupancy and identified neonicotinoids as the pesticides of greatest negative influence across our study region. The mean predicted occupancy declined by 57% from 1998 to 2020, ranging from 15 to 83% declines across 16 ecoregions. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we found continued declines in nearly half of the ecoregions by the 2050s and mean declines of 93% under the most severe scenario across all ecoregions. This assessment underscores the tenuous future of B. occidentalis and demonstrates the scale of stressors likely contributing to rapid loss of related pollinator species throughout the globe.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006–0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003–0.0006) μg active ingredient (a.i.) bee−1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate.

We have tested (1) the interference of the pesticide flupyradifurone on male precopulatory behavior and male mating partner preferences, (2) the way that the pesticide interferes in male quality assessment by the female, and (3) the effects of the pesticide on the chemical compounds in the female cuticle. We exposed bees of both sexes to a sublethal concentration of flupyradifurone. Various behaviors were registered in a mating arena with two females (one unexposed and one exposed) and one male (either unexposed or exposed). Unexposed males were quicker to attempt to mate. Treatment also impacted precopulatory behavior and male quality assessment by females. Males approached unexposed females more quickly than insecticide-exposed ones. Females exposed to insecticide produced lower amounts of some cuticular hydrocarbons (sex pheromone candidates) and appeared less choosy than unexposed females. Our findings suggest that insecticide exposure affects sexual communication, playing a role both in male preference and in male quality assessment by the female. © 2023 The Authors.

As such, the evolutionary lineages of the honey bee colonies were identified, a multiresidue analysis of xenobiotics was carried out in beebread and worker bee samples, and the Toxic Unit (TUm) was estimated for each sampled apiary. The relationship between lineages and the most prevalent pathogens (Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, trypanosomatids, Black Queen Cell Virus; and Deformed Wing Virus) was analysed with contingency tables, and the possible relationships between TUm and the prevalence of these pathogens were studied by using a factor analysis. The statistical analysis supported the associations between V. destructor and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), and between N. ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), but the association between these pathogens and trypanosomatids was not observed. TUm values varied between 5.5 × 10−6 and 3.65 × 10−1. When TUm < 3.35 × 10−4, it was mainly determined by coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and/or chlorfenvinphos. At higher values, other insecticides also contributed to TUm, although a clear predominance was not seen up to TUm ≥ 1.83 × 10−2, when it was mainly defined by acrinathrin, spinosad and/or imidacloprid. The possible cumulative effect from the joint action of xenobiotics was >10% in the 63% of the cases. The prevalence of pathogens did not appear to be influenced by the distribution of evolutionary lineages and, while the prevalence of V. destructor was not found to be determined by TUm, there was a trend towards an increasing prevalence of N. ceranae when TUm ≥ 23 10−4.

To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ∼10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae. The data suggest that the tested pesticides induced apoptosis in tissues of honey bee larvae at the tested concentrations.

A comprehensive ecological risk assessment for spinosad use in US cotton crops is presented within a framework of tiered levels of refinement following the guidelines of the US EPA for ecological risk assessments. Toxicity information for a variety of species is documented and utilized, environmental concentrations estimated, and risk characterizations in the form of risk quotients are quantified. Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict offsite transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species.

164,JOUR,Improving Mitochondrial Function Protects Bumblebees from Neonicotinoid Pesticides,"['Powner, MB', 'Salt, TE', 'Hogg, C', 'Jeffery, G']",PLOS ONE,"Global pollination is threatened by declining insect pollinator populations that may be linked to neonicotinoid pesticide use. Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria, producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed. Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure were withdrawn, survival was maintained. Bees and insects generally cannot see deep red light so it does not disturb their behaviour. Hence, we show that deep red light exposure that improves mitochondrial function, reverses the sensory and motor deficits induced by Imidacloprid. These results may have important implications as light delivery is economic and can be placed in hives/colonies.",2016/11/15/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0166531,11,11,1932-6203,WOS:000387794600077,,,,,,,0,,0,175

Beekeepers send samples to analytical laboratories, but sometimes no residues can be detected. Temperature and sun light could influence the decrease of pesticides in bee samples and thereby residues left for analysis. Moreover, samples are usually sent via normal postal services without cooling. We investigated the temporal dynamics of whole-body residues of imidacloprid in live or dead honeybees following a single-meal dietary exposure of 41 ng/bee under various environmental conditions, such as freezing, exposure to UV light or transfer of individuals through the mail system. Immobile, ""dead"" looking honeybees recovered from paralysis after 48 hours. The decrease of residues in living but paralysed bees was stopped by freezing (= killing). UV light significantly reduced residues, but the mode of transport did not affect residue levels. Group feeding increased the variance of residues, which is relevant for acute oral toxicity tests. In conclusion, elapsed time after poisoning is key for detection of neonicotinoids.

We measured sonication frequency, sonication length, and flight (wing beat) frequency of marked bees collecting pollen from Solanum lycopsersicum (tomato), and then randomly assigned bees to consume 0, 0.0515, 0.515, or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid. We recorded the number of bees in each treatment group that resumed sonication behavior after consuming imidacloprid, and re-measured sonication and flight behavior for these bees. We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515 ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid.

Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.",2015/09//,2015,10.1111/2041-210X.12416,6,9,2041-210X,WOS:000362916100007,1034,1043,,,,,0,,0,180

Imidacloprid (IMD) is a pesticide used worldwide. No information exists on how IMD impact the bees’ body bioelement balance, which is essential for bee health. We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

158,JOUR,Examination of mass honey bee death at the entrance to hives in a paddy rice production district in Japan: The influence of insecticides sprayed on nearby rice fields,"['Kimura, K.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Saiou, K.', 'Nirasawa, K.', 'Ishizaka, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Beekeepers in Japan have been finding as many as 1,000 dead honey bees piled up in front of hive entrances. They have observed that these mass bee deaths tend to occur at about the same time as measures are taken to control rice bugs, which appear every year during the summer in rice-producing districts. We set up and conducted controlled field studies from July to August in 2012 in a rice-producing district of northern Japan where frequent mass bee deaths are observed each summer. As had occurred in the area in previous years, and as we directly observed during our field investigations, masses of honey bees were found dead at the entrance to their hives. Samples of pollen and honey bee corpses were found to contain measurable concentrations of five active ingredients of insecticides: clothianidin, dinotefuran, ethiprole, etofenprox, and phenthoate. Insecticides containing these active ingredients are known to have been used for rice bug control in this area. Furthermore, we did not observe other known honey bee death agents in the area, such as mites and hornets. Thus, we suspected that the phenomenon of ""piled honey bee death"" (PD) at hive entrances is related to the influence of insecticides used to control rice bugs in paddies. The insecticide concentrations in dead honey bees were, however, extremely low compared with the median lethal dose (LD50) for honey bees. Moreover, PD was observed after rice anthesis, when bees would be collecting pollen from flowering plants other than rice. This calls into question any direct link between mass bee death and insecticides. Further study is necessary to understand insecticide exposure routes and the actual mechanism of the PD phenomenon. © IBRA 2014",2014///,2014,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.12,53,5,,,599,606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920153258&doi=10.3896%2fIBRA.1.53.5.12&partnerID=40&md5=ba4eacfa3b5fbbadcfd183d8440f1dd9,Scopus,,,0,,0,185

Here, we used a field experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of floral enhancement in reducing bee exposure to insecticides. A mass-flowering crop, white mustard, was cultivated in a small patch near an experimental apiary comprising 10 hives. To assess the frequency of floral patch use by bees in each hive, we attached electronic tags to bees foraging on white mustard flowers and then recorded the number of tagged bees in each hive a day before insecticide spraying in the adjacent paddy fields. The number of corpses around hive entrances increased within a day after the spraying but varied among hives. There was a significant negative correlation between the number of tagged bees and the cumulative number of corpses at each hive.

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

However, their proximity to pest control activities in the crop may result in pesticide exposure if pesticides drift into pollinator plantings. To quantify pesticide residues in pollinator plantings, we sampled flowers and soil from pollinator plantings and compared them to samples from unenhanced field margins and crop row middles. At conventionally managed farms, flowers from pollinator plantings had similar exposure profiles to those from unenhanced field margins or crop row middles, with multiple pesticides and high and similar risk quotient (RQ) values (with pollinator planting RQ: 3.9; without pollinator planting RQ: 4.0). Whereas samples from unsprayed sites had significantly lower risk (RQ: 0.005). Soil samples had overall low risk to bees. Additionally, we placed bumble bee colonies ( Bombus impatiens ) in field margins of crop fields with and without pollinator plantings and measured residues in bee -collected pollen. Pesticide exposure was similar in pollen from sites with or without pollinator plantings, and risk was generally high (with pollinator planting RQ: 0.5; without pollinator planting RQ: 1.1) and not significant between the two field types. Risk was lower at sites where there was no pesticide activity (RQ: 0.3), but again there was no significant difference between management types. The insecticide phosmet, which is used on blueberry farms for control of Drosophila suzukii , accounted for the majority of elevated risk. Additionally, analysis of pollen collected by bumble bees found no significant difference in floral species richness between sites with or without pollinator plantings. Our results suggest that pollinator plantings do not reduce pesticide risk and do not increase pollen diversity collected by B. impatiens , further highlighting the need to reduce exposure through enhanced IPM adoption, drift mitigation, and removal of attractive flowering weeds prior to insecticide applications.",2024/04/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171248,922,,0048-9697,WOS:001222172400001,,,,,,,0,,0,191

Unfortunately, as many as 40% of crop pollinators are in a steep decline due to habitat loss and exposure to agrochemicals. Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40). Concurrent, colocated total suspended particulate matter samples contained multiple insecticides and parasiticides including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones, in significantly higher concentrations downwind of feedyards (bifenthrin, 8.45 ± 4.92; permethrin, 1032.34 ± 740.76; clothianidin, 3.61 ± 1.48; imidacloprid, 73.32 ± 47.52; thiamethoxam, 5.81 ± 3.16; abamectin, 0.45 ± 0.29; ivermectin, 8.88 ± 5.06 ng/g).

The aim of this study was to know the acute lethal toxicity of acetamiprid, malathion, phosmet and spinosad insecticides on P. emerina and T. fiebrigi. We obtained the mean concentration and mean lethal dose (LC50 and LD50) and the mean survival of workers after oral and topical exposure to insecticides, respectively. The LC50 values (ng a.i./μl of diet) and the decreasing order of toxicity for P. emerina was spinosad (4.96) > malathion (18.75) > phosmet (97.33) > acetamiprid (4204.06), and for T. fiebrigi also was spinosad (5.65) > malathion (8.39) > phosmet (53.91) > acetamiprid (9841.32), when orally exposed. The LD50 values (ng a.i./bee) and the decreasing order of toxicity for P. emerina was spinosad (1.90) > malathion (10.90) > phosmet (19.54) > acetamiprid (6216.55) and for T. fiebrigi was malathion (29.29) ≥ spinosad (29.79) > phosmet (41.95) > acetamiprid (1421.23), when topically exposed. The mean survival (hours) of contaminated bees by malathion, phosmet, and spinosad, was 11.81, 7.20, and 12.32 for P. emerina and 8.55, 7.20, and 13.34 for T. fiebrigi when orally exposed; and was 4.87, 9.87 and 11.17 for P. emerina, and 4.87, 4.76, and 19.05 for T. fiebrigi when topically exposed.

However, if pesticides are misused and the potential exposure risk to bees based on realistic pesticide application data are still little reported. In this study, pesticide application patterns in wheat-maize rotation system, vegetable and apple producing areas, was studied by interviewing farmers in Quzhou County, the North China Plain. The pesticide use status was evaluated by the recommended and actual applied dose and risk quotient (RQ) based Bee-REX model was used to assess the exposure risks of pesticide to bees based on the collected pesticide application data. The results showed that over half (52 %) of farmers in selected sites misused pesticides and orchard owners were frequently misused pesticides. Positive correlations were found between pesticide usage performance and farmers' specialized training experience. Pesticides applied in orchards have caused higher exposure risks to bees with the mean of RQs exceed 120 and 1880 via acute contact and dietary routes, respectively. Pesticide misuse significantly elevates the exposure risk to bees that the mean RQ under misuse scenarios was 5.8 times than that of correct use. Abamectin, fipronil and neonicotinoids contributed most to the pesticide exposure risk to bees.

The investigation revealed that the farmer was using different pesticides against pests and diseases during that time. Experiments using the feeding stations (Free-Choice Trials) method with honey solutions containing pesticides revealed that the repellency effect of pesticide formulations is different with some even attractive to honey bees. Experiments were held outdoors close to bee colonies and indoors in a fly-through hall in controlled conditions and commercial pesticides were used. The highest repellency in outdoors/indoors experiments was observed using the solution with formulations of pesticide Horizon 250 EW (a. c. tebuconazole)–96.5%/99% and Nurelle D (a. c. chlorpyriphos-cypermethrin) 88%/97%, and the lowest repellency was observed for solution with formulations of Plenum (a. c. pymetrozine)–19.2%/27.8%, Mospilan 20 SP (a. c. acetamiprid)–20%/23.8%.

In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes, bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%.

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. © 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental hives entrance located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against varroosis in the experimental hives, was detected in 94% of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80% of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68% dimethoate, and 32% imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223 ng/g respectively.

163,JOUR,Is pollinator visitation of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) influenced by cultivar or pesticide treatment?,"['Stejskalová, M.', 'Konradyová, V.', 'Suchanová, M.', 'Kazda, J.']",Crop Protection,"Beneficial insects, such as Apis mellifera (honey bees) and Bombus sp. (bumble bees), play important roles in the environment as pollinators, and they are directly affected by agronomical practices, such as pesticide spraying or the selection of crop cultivar. Sunflower is an important resource for these pollinators, and its yield is highly dependent on pollination. Six sunflower hybrid cultivars (ES Biba, Gonzalo, Drake, Vellox, NK Neoma, and P63LE10) were used to compare the visitation rates (VR) of pollinators during flowering in three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). From this set, cultivar P63LE10 was selected to evaluate how pesticide treatments (mixture of two insecticide products containing acetamiprid and pirimicarb, respectively, and two fungicide products containing propiconazole plus prochloraz and dimoxystrobin plus boscalid, respectively) affect pollinator visitation. The amount of pesticide residue in sunflower inflorescences was analyzed to determine the content over the duration of the experiments. The sunflower cultivar P63LE10 was significantly the most attractive to both groups of pollinators in 2017. This cultivar was visited by the highest number of honey bees also in the other years. For bumble bees, cultivar P63LE10, along with cultivars NK Neoma and Vellox, had the highest visitation rates in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, plants treated by the fungicide dimoxystrobin plus boscalid had the highest visitation rates for both groups of pollinators. For bumble bees plants treated with this fungicide were significantly more visited (VR 23.1 ± 2.1%) than these treated with insecticide with pirimicarb (16.4 ± 2%) and the untreated control (17.9 ± 1.7%), and for honey bees plants treated with dimoxystrobin plus boscalid were significantly more visited (VR 24 ± 4.5%) than all other treatments except with acetamiprid (20.5 ± 3.5%). The residues of tested pesticides were found in blooms for the whole time of the experiment (range of values for 2016 and 2017 [ng/g]: acetamiprid 144–6, 3360–56; pirimicarb 177–12, 223–10; prochloraz 380–6, 1970–912; propiconazole 324–17, 1024–1018; boscalid 216–154, 9600–1319; dimoxystrobin 452–137, 6560–911).

In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",2020/09//,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13682,57,9,0021-8901,WOS:000543973300001,1818,1828,,,,,0,,0,210

Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

Dead honey bees were only collected and analyzed when significant mortality episodes occurred and pesticide content in beeswax of each experimental apiary was evaluated at the beginning of the study. Samples were extracted by a modified QuEChERS procedure and screened for pesticides residues by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pesticide hazard in the samples was evaluated through the hazard quotient approach (HQ). Beebread was widely contaminated with coumaphos and amitraz degradate 2, 4-dimethylphenylformamide (DMF), miticides detected in 94 and 97% of samples respectively. However, insecticides sprayed during citrus bloom like chlorpyrifos (up to 167 ng g −1)and dimethoate (up to 34 ng g −1)were the main responsible of the relevant pesticide hazard in this matrix. Pesticide levels in live bees were mostly residual, and pesticide hazard was low. Beeswax of the apiaries, contaminated by miticides, revealed a low pesticide hazard to honey bee colonies. Acute mortality episodes occurred only in the two apiaries located near agricultural settings. Dead bees collected during these episodes revealed high levels (up to 2700 ng g −1)of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, omethoate and imidacloprid.
