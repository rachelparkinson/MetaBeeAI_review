93,JOUR,Imidacloprid and thiacloprid neonicotinoids bind more favourably to cockroach than to honeybee α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: Insights from computational studies,"['Selvam, B', 'Graton, J', 'Laurent, AD', 'Alamiddine, Z', 'Mathé-Allainmat, M', 'Lebreton, J', 'Coqueret, O', 'Olivier, C', 'Thany, SH', 'Le Questel, JY']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS & MODELLING,"The binding interactions of two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMI) and thiacloprid (THI) with the extracellular domains of cockroach and honeybee alpha 6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits in an homomeric receptor have been studied through docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI). Finally, in both insects nAChRs, THI is consistently found to bind more favourably than IMI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Its specific pharmacological profile on cockroach dorsal unpaired median neurons (DUM) helped to identify alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive nAChR2 receptors. In the present study, we tested its effect on cockroach Kenyon cells. We found that it induced an inward current demonstrating that it bounds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed on Kenyon cells. Interestingly, LMA10203-induced currents were completely blocked by the nicotinic antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin. We suggested that LMA10203 effect occurred through the activation of alpha-bungarotoxin-sensitive receptors and did not involve alpha-bungarotoxin-insensitive nAChR2, previously identified in DUM neurons. In addition, we have synthesized two new compounds, LMA10210 and LMA10211, and compared their effects on Kenyon cells. These compounds were members of the 3-quinuclidinyl benzamide or benzoate families. Interestingly, 1 mM LMA10210 was not able to induce an inward current on Kenyon cells compared to LMA10211. Similarly, we did not find any significant effect of LMA10210 on cockroach ganglionic depolarization, whereas these three compounds were able to induce an effect on the central nervous system of the third instar M. domestica larvae.

The structure-activity relationships of acetamiprid homologues and 3-pyridylmethylamines (known as the essential structural requirement of nicotinoid) are compared in terms of the affinity to the [H-3]alpha- bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT) site (designated as ACh site) and the [H-3]phencyclidine (PCP) site [designated as noncompetitive blocker (NCB) site] of the insect nAChR from the honeybee heads. Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [H-3]alpha-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [H-3]PCP binding in the insect nAChR. Scatchard analysis reveals that homologues of acetamiprid and 3-pyridylmethylamine having n-butyl substituents interact with the high-affinity binding site for [H-3]PCP, which is considered to be the NCB site located in the ion channel of the insect nAChR.

First published July 6, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00126.2011.-Acetylcholine (ACh) is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the insect brain, where nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast cholinergic synaptic transmission. In the honeybee Apis mellifera, nAChRs are expressed in diverse structures including the primary olfactory centers of the brain, the antennal lobes (ALs) and the mushroom bodies (MBs), where they participate in olfactory information processing. To understand the nature and properties of the nAChRs involved in these processes, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of nAChRs on cultured Kenyon cells of the MBs, using whole cell patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR. In all cells, applications of ACh as well as nicotinic agonists such as nicotine and imidacloprid induced inward currents with fast desensitization. These currents were fully blocked by saturating doses of the antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT), dihydroxy-beta-erythroidine (DHE), and methyllycaconitine (MLA) (MLA >= alpha-BGT >= DHE). Molecular analysis of ACh-responding cells revealed that of the 11 nicotinic receptor subunits encoded within the honeybee genome, alpha 2, alpha 8, and beta 1 subunits were expressed in adult Kenyon cells. Comparison with the expression pattern of adult AL cells revealed the supplementary presence of subunit alpha 7, which could be responsible for the kinetic and pharmacological differences observed when comparing ACh-induced currents from AL and Kenyon cells. Together, our data demonstrate the existence of functional nAChRs on adult MB Kenyon cells that differ from nAChRs on AL cells in both their molecular composition and pharmacological properties, suggesting that changing receptor subsets could mediate different processing functions depending on the brain structure within the olfactory pathway.",2011/10//,2011,10.1152/jn.00126.2011,106,4,0022-3077,WOS:000296092000002,1604.0,1613.0,,,,,0,,1,5

We tested the effects of imidacloprid on ligand-gated ion channels of cultured Kenyon cells of the honeybee, Apis mellifera. Kenyon cells build up the mushroom body neuropils, which are involved in higher order neuronal processes such as olfactory learning. We measured whole-cell currents through nicotinic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors using patch-clamp techniques. Pressure applications of imidacloprid elicited inward currents, which were irreversibly blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin. Imidacloprid was a partial nicotinic agonist, since it elicited only 36% of ACh-induced currents and competitively blocked 64% of the peak ACh-induced currents. GABA-induced currents were partially blocked when imidacloprid was coapplied and this block was independent upon activation of nAChRs.

Acetylcholine or carbamylcholine were full agonists, nicotine, epibatidine and cytisine were only partial agonists. Coapplications of these partial agonists with acetylcholine reduced the current amplitude. The most efficient antagonists were dihydroxy-β-erythroidine (EC50 = 0.5 pmol·l-1) and methyllycaconitine (EC50 = 24 pmol·l-1). The open channel blocker mecamylamine, d-tubocurarine and hexamethonium were rather weak blockers of the honeybee nicotinic response.

The use of chaperone proteins has been key to successful functional expression of these receptors in heterologous systems, permitting functional and pharmacological studies of insect nAChRs with particular subunit composition. Here, we report the first use of the chaperone protein, NACHO, to enable functional expression of an insect nAChR, the α6 subunit from Apis mellifera, in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This is also the first report of functional expression of a homomeric insect α6 nAChR. Using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology we show that the acetylcholine EC50 of the α6 receptor is 0.88 μM and that acetylcholine responses are antagonized by α-bungarotoxin. Spinosad showed agonist actions and kept the ion channel open when co-applied with acetylcholine, reinforcing the α6 nAChR subunit as a key molecular target for the spinosyn class of insecticide.

The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids. These findings on the diverse mode of action for neonicotinoids to target and non-target receptor would be helpful for on novel insecticides design with high bioactivity as well as good selectivity based on the structure of different insect nAChR.

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024/08/29/,2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11,1,2196-5641,WOS:001303583400003,,,,,"['AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Cowpea aphid', 'Honeybee', 'NAChR', 'Neonicotinoids']",,0,,1,15

To explore the molecular mechanisms of neonicotinoid toxicity to bees, the different binding modes of imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and flupyradifurone with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α1β1 and cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3) were studied using homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. These mechanisms provided a basis for the design of compounds with a potential low bee toxicity. Consequently, we designed and synthesized a series of triazinone derivatives and assessed their bioassays. Among them, compound 5a not only displayed substantially insecticidal activities against Aphis glycines (LC50 = 4.40 mg/L) and Myzus persicae (LC50 = 6.44 mg/L) but also had low toxicity to Apis mellifera. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings further confirmed that compound 5a interacted with the M. persicae nAChR α1 subunit but not with the A. mellifera nAChR α1 subunit.

In this study, the nAChR α1 subunit from Apis mellifera was first found to be narrowly tuned to different bee toxicity insecticides, namely, sulfoxaflor (SFX) and flupyradifurone (FPF). Hence, novel sulfoximine derivatives 7a-h were rationally designed and synthesized by introducing a benzo[d][1,3]dioxole moiety into a unique sulfoximine skeleton based on the binding cavity characteristics of Amelα1/ratβ2. The two electrode voltage clamp responses of 7a-h were obviously lower than that of SFX, indicating their potentially low bee toxicity.

Compared compounds with a high bee-toxicity, compounds with low bee-toxicity were found to have higher logP values. Therefore, two series of novel butenolide derivatives with different hydrophobic groups were designed and synthesized by including different hydrophobic groups.

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7–2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to α8 subunit of nAChR of Apis mellifera. The α8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network.

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system. Disturbed energy production may reduce foraging activity and hormonal dysregulation, such as the transition of nurse bees to foragers.

Here, we report the characterisation of a third P450 gene CYP9Q6, previously mis-annotated in the genome of B. terrestris, encoding an enzyme that metabolises the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids thiacloprid and acetamiprid with high efficiency. The genomic location and complete ORE of CYP9Q6 was corroborated by PCR and its metabolic activity characterised in vitro by expression in an insect cell line. CYP9Q6 metabolises both thiacloprid and acetamiprid more rapidly than the previously reported CYP9Q4 and CYP9Q5. We further demonstrate a direct, in vivo correlation between the expression of the CYP9Q6 enzyme in transgenic Drosophila melanogaster and an increased tolerance to thiacloprid and acetamiprid. We conclude that CYP9Q6 is an efficient metaboliser of N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids and likely plays a key role in the high tolerance of B. terrestris to these insecticides.",2019/08//,2019,10.1016/j.ibmb.2019.05.006,111,,0965-1748,WOS:000478706500004,,,,,,,0,,1,27

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in mediating various biological and pathological processes, involving transcriptional and gene regulation. The effects of dinotefuran on lncRNA expression and lncRNA function in the honey bee brain are still obscure. Results: Through RNA sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed following exposure to 0.01 mg/L dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d. In total, 312 lncRNAs and 1341 mRNAs, 347 lncRNAs and 1458 mRNAs, and 345 lncRNAs and 1155 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the dinotefuran-treated group showed enrichment in carbohydrate and protein metabolism and immune-inflammatory responses such as glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and Hippo and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Moreover, the DE lncRNA TCONS_00086519 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may serve as a competing endogenous RNA and a regulatory factor in the immune response to dinotefuran. Conclusion: This study characterized the expression profile of lncRNAs upon exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides in young adult honey bees and provided a framework for further study of the role of lncRNAs in honey bee growth and the immune response. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021///,2021,10.1186/s12864-021-07811-y,22,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85110827000&doi=10.1186%2fs12864-021-07811-y&partnerID=40&md5=f67822511823a825214f9485ff879511,Scopus,"['adult', 'amino acid metabolism', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'brain', 'Brain', 'brain tissue', 'carbohydrate metabolism', 'controlled study', 'cytoplasm', 'dinotefuran', 'Dinotefuran', 'drug effect', 'fluorescence in situ hybridization', 'gene expression', 'glucuronic acid', 'glycine', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'immune response', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'lncRNA', 'long untranslated RNA', 'messenger RNA', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'pentose', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein metabolism', 'regulatory mechanism', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA sequencing', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'serine', 'TGF beta signaling', 'threonine', 'transforming growth factor beta', 'young adult']",,0,,1,28

The high-throughput small RNA-sequencing was used to analyze global miRNA expression profile changes in honeybees orally exposed to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid (20 mg/L and 4 mg/L) for 72 h. Thiacloprid at 20 mg/L had no observed adverse effects. In addition, bees were fed with miRNA mimics or inhibitors to increase or decrease ame-miR-283–5p expression, and its effects on P450 gene expression (CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3) were examined. Thiacloprid susceptibility was also detected. The results showed that treatment with thiacloprid at 20 mg/L and 4 mg/L induced 11 and five differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs), respectively. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the DEMs are mainly involved in the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, nerve conduction, and behavior. ame-miR-283–5p was downregulated by both concentrations, which was validated using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis. Enhancing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly inhibited CYP9Q2 mRNA and protein expression, and increased thiacloprid toxicity, while reducing ame-miR-283–5p expression significantly promoted CYP9Q2 expression, and decreased thiacloprid susceptibility.

Here we assessed expressional alteration of marker genes indicative of endocrine effects in the brain of honey bees. We exposed foragers to chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and thiacloprid and assessed the expression of genes after exposure for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Chlorpyrifos caused the strongest expressional changes at 24 h characterized by induction of vitellogenin, major royal jelly protein (mrjp) 2 and 3, insulin-like peptide (ilp1), alpha-glucosidase (hbg3) and sima, and down-regulation of buffy. Cypermethrin caused minor induction of mrjp1, mrjp2, mmp1 and ilp1. The sima transcript showed down-regulation at 48 h and up-regulation at 72 h. Exposure to thiacloprid caused down-regulation of vitellogenin, mrjp1 and sima at 24 h, and hbg3 at 72 h, as well as induction of ilp1 at 48 h. The buffy transcript was down-regulated at 24 h and up-regulated at 48 h. Despite compound-specific expression patterns, each insecticide altered the expression of some of the suggested endocrine system related genes. Our study suggests that expressional changes of genes prominently expressed in nurse or forager bees, including down-regulation of buffy and mrjps and up-regulation of hbg3 and ilp1 may serve as indicators for endocrine activity of insecticides in foragers. © 2020 The Author(s)",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127542,260,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087994439&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.127542&partnerID=40&md5=912aab386241a2ac1cca26288c43f5fe,Scopus,"['adult', 'alpha glucosidase', 'Alpha glucosidase', 'animal', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apis mellifera carnica', 'Apoidea', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'brain', 'Brain', 'brain tissue', 'buffy gene', 'chlorpyrifos', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'cypermethrin', 'Cypermethrin', 'Cypermethrins', 'down regulation', 'Down-regulation', 'drug effect', 'ecdysone receptor', 'Endocrine activity', 'Endocrine effects', 'endocrine system', 'Endocrine System', 'Endocrine systems', 'Expression patterns', 'Food products', 'forager', 'foraging', 'gene', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic transcription', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'Honey bees', 'honeybee', 'induced response', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'insulin like peptide 1', 'interstitial collagenase', 'major royal jelly protein 2', 'major royal jelly protein 3', 'Major royal jelly proteins', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'neuropeptide', 'nonhuman', 'physiology', 'protein', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction', 'RNA extraction', 'RNA isolation', 'sima protein', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'unclassified drug', 'upregulation', 'vitellogenin', 'Vitellogenins']",,0,,1,30

The presence of these P450s, belonging or closely related to the CYP9Q subfamily (CYP9Q-related), is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees. However, the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, lacks CYP9Q-related P450s and is 170–2500 times more sensitive to certain insecticides than bee pollinators with these P450s. The extent to which these findings apply to other Megachilidae bee species remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four Megachile species and leveraged the data obtained, in combination with publicly available genomic data, to investigate the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae. Our analyses reveal that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-related genes. In place of these genes Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage. Functional expression of these P450s from M. rotundata reveal they lack the capacity to metabolize the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In contrast, species from the Osmiini and Dioxyini tribes of Megachilidae have CYP9Q-related P450s belonging to the CYP9BU subfamily that are able to detoxify thiacloprid.

68,JOUR,Design of environmentally friendly neonicotinoid insecticides with bioconcentration tuning and Bi-directional selective toxic effects,"['Zhao, YY', 'Li, Y']",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"A 3D-QSAR model was established with CoMSIA to characterize neonicotinoid insecticides. LgBCF values were used as the dependent variable and the molecular structures of 30 compounds were used as the independent variable. This model was used to design neonicotinoid insecticides with reduced bioconcentration. The contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model were used to evaluate substituted sites and different substituents that significantly affected the bioconcentration of neonicotinoid insecticides. The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491 by in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 degrees C), heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and phoxim) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress.

Insect metamorphosis and response to external stress are altered by deleting CYP450 genes. In this study, we identified and analyzed a novel gene of CYP450 family, AccCYP6A13, from Apis cerana cerana, and explored its role in the response of Apis cerana cerana to adverse external stressors. It was found that the expression of AccCYP6A13 was spatiotemporal specificity. The expression level increased with age and reached its highest value in the adult stage. The primarily expressiong location were legs, brain, and epidermis of honeybees. Stress conditions can affect the expression of AccCYP6A13 depending on treatment times. RNA interference experiments have shown that knocking down AccCYP6A13 reduces antioxidant activity and deactivates detoxification enzymes, resulting in oxidative damage accumulation and a decline in detoxification capability in bees, as well as inhibiting numerous antioxidant genes. Additionally, knockdown of the AccCYP6A13 gene in Apis cerana cerana resulted in increased sensitivity to pesticides and increased mortality when treated with neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam. AccCYP6A13 overexpression in a prokaryotic system further confirmed its role in resistance to oxidative stress.

Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples.

However, recent researcprovides evidence of the negative effects of this and its possible influence on the deterioration of the health of pollinators. Durinthe experiment, mixed-age worker bees of A. mellifera were exposed to a single, sublethal oral dose of flupyradifurone (645 ngbee) and were assessed only for the first day after exposure to 0.5, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hours. Using reverse transcriptase polymeraschain reaction (RT-qPCR), the alteration in gene expression caused by exposure to this insecticide was quantified. A total of fiv genes were quantified: three primary antioxidant genes (Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and Thioredoxin dismutase (Trxr1), one detoxification gene (Cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3)) and one gene with neuronal activity (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE1). The endogenous ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) gene allowed the estimation of relative gene expression as the response to insecticide exposure. The AChE1 gene was overexpressed up to six hours after exposure; the remaining CYP9Q3, CAT, SOD1, and Trxr1 genes presented a similar behavior. At a sublethal dose and at short time intervals, flupyradifurone causes alteration in the relative expression of five genes in individual honeybees after oral exposure, which could cause a long-term adverse effect on hive health. © 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. © 2019 by the authors.",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074627857&doi=10.3390%2finsects10110382&partnerID=40&md5=1d7cd991c5dc71ff1cccacd749911b7f,Scopus,,,0,,1,40
202,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/food–oral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not host–pathogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey bees’ innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,0,,1,41

However, the molecular bases mediated at the gene level remain to be discovered. Here, we found four heat shock protein DnaJB subfamily genes, DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14, from Apis cerana cerana, that all have J domains in their protein sequences. The expression levels of DnaJB6 and DnaJshv were upregulated by different degrees of heat stress, and the transcript level of DnaJB14 was gradually upregulated as the degree of heat stress increased, while the mRNA level of DnaJB13 was downregulated at multiple time points during heat stress treatment. The mRNA levels of all four DnaJBs were upregulated by cold and UV stress. In addition, the expression levels of DnaJB6, DnaJshv and DnaJB13 were reduced under abamectin, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl stresses. The transcript level of DnaJB14 was decreased by imidacloprid, cypermethrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl exposure but increased by abamectin and bifenthrin exposure. These results indicate that the demand of A. cerana cerana for these four DnaJBs differs under various stress conditions. To further explore the role of DnaJBs in the stress response, we successfully silenced DnaJshv and DnaJB14. The content of protein carbonyl was increased, while the content of VC, the enzymatic activities of CAT, GST, and SOD, the mRNA levels of many antioxidant-related genes, and the total antioxidant capacity were reduced after knockdown of DnaJshv and DnaJB14 in A. cerana cerana. These results indicate that silencing DnaJshv and DnaJB14 increases oxidative damage and decreases the antioxidant ability of A. cerana cerana. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14 are differentially expressed under stress conditions and play crucial roles in response to various stressors, possibly through the antioxidant signalling pathway.

In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58.6 mg a.i./L imidacloprid)+Domark (512.5 mg a.i. /L tetraconazole), Advise+Transform (58.5 mg a.i./L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a. i./L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20%, 15%, and 26% respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mga.i./L L- cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees. Our findings indicated mixtures of Advise with detoxification-enzyme-inducing pesticides may help bees to detoxify Advise, while toxicity synergists may pose further risk to bees, such as the Bracket which not only suppressed esterase and AChE activities, but also increased toxicity to bees.",2017///,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0176837,12,5,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018727538&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0176837&partnerID=40&md5=890758422e5278438274fa35ea774284,Scopus,,,0,,1,43

However, little is known about the physiological effects of sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate exposure on bumblebees. We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5 mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10 days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, α-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut α-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activity of prophenoloxidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition. Our results provide information on the sublethal effects of exposure to low concentrations of glyphosate and spinetoram on bumblebees in terms of physiology and gut microbes.

We acquired 1-day-old, 20-day-old, and 2-year-old queens and 1-day-old and 20-day-old workers (foragers) fed 0, 5, or 200 ppb imidacloprid, a pesticide oxidative stressor. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase and the level of total antioxidant potential were determined in hemolymph. The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. © 2021 by the authors.

69,JOUR,Use of double-stranded RNA targeting β2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit to control pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum at larval and adult stages,"['Ligonniere, S', 'Raymond, V', 'Goven, D']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of the RNA interference technology (RNAi) has emerged as one of the new strategies for species-specific control of insect pests. Its specificity depends on the distinctiveness of the target gene sequence for a given species. In this work, we assessed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (A. pisum) the use of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets the beta 2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (dsRNA-beta 2), which shares low sequence identity with other subunits, to control populations of this pest at different developmental stages. Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

80,JOUR,A sublethal dose of neonicotinoid imidacloprid precisely sensed and detoxified by a C-minus odorant-binding protein 17 highly expressed in the legs of Apis cerana,"['Qiu, Y.-L.', 'Wu, F.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Jiang, H.-Q.', 'Chen, J.-T.', 'Pan, Y.-J.', 'Li, H.-L.']",Science of the Total Environment,"As a native honeybee species in East Asia, Apis cerana is essential for the stability of local agricultural and plant ecosystems by its' olfactory system for searching nectar and pollen sources. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 × 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana. Also, our research enriches the theoretical knowledge of the sensing and detoxifying activities of non-target insects' olfactory sensory system to environmental sublethal doses of systemic insecticides. © 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163762,885,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156209707&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163762&partnerID=40&md5=b7a0042081a3f20bd2f0f0a184431246,Scopus,"['amino acid sequence', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'Animals', 'Apis cerana', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'binding affinity', 'binding assay', 'Binding energy', 'Biochemistry', 'chemistry', 'clinical article', 'crystal structure', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'East Asia', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Electrophysiology', 'enthalpy', 'entropy', 'expression vector', 'fluorescence', 'fragrance', 'gene expression', 'gene sequence', 'honeybee', 'human', 'hydrogen bond', 'Hydrogen bonds', 'hydrophobicity', 'Hydrophobicity', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'low temperature', 'melphalan', 'metabolism', 'molecular cloning', 'molecular docking', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'odorant-binding protein', 'Odorant-binding protein', 'Odorant-binding proteins', 'olfactory system', 'Olfactory systems', 'pheromone', 'Pheromones', 'physiological response', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollution exposure', 'protein', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA interference', 'RNAi', 'Semiochemicals', 'sequence analysis', 'spatiotemporal analysis', 'spectrofluorometry', 'static electricity', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'Temperature', 'theoretical study', 'Thermoanalysis', 'thermodynamics', 'Thermodynamics', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'Van der Waals forces']",,0,,0,50

67,JOUR,Modified neonicotinoid insecticide with bi-directional selective toxicity and drug resistance,"['Zhao, Y.', 'Li, Y.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"A three-dimensional quantitative structure–activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model was established based on the molecular structures and the negative logarithm of experimental lethal concentration 50 values (pLC50) of neonicotinoid insecticides. Then, the mechanisms of bi-directional selective toxic effects and drug resistance were determined using homology modeling and molecular docking analyses. The results of the model showed that the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 12- positions of neonicotinoid insecticides strongly affected their toxicity, and that the introduction of bulky or electropositive groups at these positions could increase the pLC50 values. Using Compound 19 as a template, we designed 37 derivatives with greater toxicity (increased by 0.04–11.45%). Among them, 20 derivatives had bioconcentrations lower than that of Compound 19 (reduced by 0.38–147.88%). Further screening of Compound 19 and the 20 derivatives mentioned above by homology modeling and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) molecular docking analyses showed that 10 derivatives had bi-directional selective toxic effects against pests and bees. Further docking analyses of Compound 19 and these 10 derivatives identified that Derivative-33 showed decreased docking with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S transferase (GST) in pests and enhanced docking with these enzymes in bees, indicating bi-directional selective resistance for pests and bees. Accordingly, Derivative-33 was selected as a new insecticide with high toxicity to pests and low toxicity to bees (bi-directional selective toxicity), low resistance in pest populations, and high resistance in bee populations.

This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UV–visible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's α-helix content, suggesting structural alterations. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further elucidate the binding modes and stability of these interactions, highlighting the role of specific amino acids in CSP3's binding cavity.

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding. This research sheds light on pesticides′ probable inhibitory effects on SDH, a vital enzyme in honey bee energy production and mitochondrial function.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a ""custom"" synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016/06/29/,2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512,64,25,0021-8561,WOS:000378984500002,5148.0,5155.0,,,,,0,,0,55

Furthermore, contamination of bee flora with insecticide residue is another cause of honeybee mortality. The current study assessed the toxicity of five insecticides, namely bifenthrin (Talstar (R) 10EC), endosulfan (Thiodon (R) 35EC), imidacloprid (Confidor (R) 200SL), ethofenprox (Trebon (R) 30EC) and diafenthiuron (Polo (R) 500SC) against haemocytes of the honeybee, A. mellifera under standard laboratory conditions. Analysis for counts of total haemocytes, differential haemocytes, and abnormalities was determined for larvae, pupae, and adult worker bees of A. mellifera. The haemolymph samples were assessed soon after, 30 and 60 min for selected insecticides applied at a concentration of recommended field doses. The total count of haemocytes was found to be significantly maximum in larval and pupal stages (35818 cells/mm(3), 3387 cells/mm(3)) while lowest (5493 cells/mm(3)) in adult workers, but differential counts of haemocytes remained somewhat insignificant for all insecticides applied. Variation of total haemocytes count of honeybee resulted for all tested insecticides. Results revealed an increase in haemocytes count (6662 cells/mm(3), 7237 cells/mm(3), 7081 cells/mm(3)) of adult honeybees exposed to diafenthiuron, ethofenprox, and imidacloprid soon after application; however, these counts dropped (4506 cells/mm(3), 4262 cells/mm(3), 3481 cells/mm(3), 4325 cells/mm(3)) after sixty minutes of application for all tested insecticides except for bifenthrin when compared with the untreated adult honeybee. While for differential count, granulocytes and plasmatocyte numbers increased in adult worker A. mellifera after the application of insecticides. Haemocytes immune response to insecticides exhibited abnormalities of various degrees, such as denucleation, cell shape distortion and agglutination.

At sublethal doses, these chemicals have been shown to negatively affect a number of behaviours, including performance of olfactory learning and memory, due to their interference with acetylcholine signalling in the mushroom bodies. Here we provide evidence that neonicotinoids can affect odour coding upstream of the mushroom bodies, in the first odour processing centres of the honeybee brain, i.e. the antennal lobes (ALs). In particular, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid, the most common neonicotinoid, in the AL glomeruli via in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with pulsed odour stimulation. Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016/12/01/,2016,10.1038/srep38110,6,,2045-2322,WOS:000389659800001,,,,,,,0,,0,57

A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulators of gene expression. In this study, we initially determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of dinotefuran was 0.773 mg/l. Then, the expression profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) in honey bee brains after 1, 5, and 10 d of treatment with the lethal concentration 10 (LC10) of dinotefuran were explored via deep small-RNA sequencing and bioinformatics. In total, 2, 23, and 27 DE miRNAs were identified after persistent exposure to the LC10 of dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d, respectively. Some abundant miRNAs, such as ame-miR-375-3p, ame-miR-281-5p, ame-miR-3786-3p, ame-miR-10-5p, and ame-miR-6037-3p, were extremely significantly differentially expressed.

They play important roles in regulating caste differentiation, behavior development, and immune defences in the honey bee, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this study, we explored the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on miRNA expression in this species using deep small RNA sequencing. The results showed that seven miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (q-value <0.01 and |log2(fold-change)| >1) upon exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. Some candidate target genes were related to behavior, immunity, and neural function. Several miRNAs, including ame-miR-124, ame-miR-981, ame-miR-3791, and ame-miR-6038, were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis.

43,JOUR,"Neonicotinoid Pesticides Cause Mass Fatalities of Native Bumble Bees: A Case Study from Wilsonville, Oregon, United States","['Hatfield, R.G.', 'Strange, J.P.', 'Koch, J.B.', 'Jepsen, S.', 'Stapleton, I.']",Environmental Entomology,"In June of 2013 an application of dinotefuran on an ornamental planting of European linden trees (Tilia cordata Mill. [Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature. It is likely that the vast majority of mass pesticide kills of beneficial insects across other environments go unnoticed and unreported. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

In the present study, the effects of chronic FPF exposure on bees were systematically investigated at the individual behavioral, tissue, cell, enzyme activity, and the gene expression levels. Chronic exposure (14 d) to FPF led to reduced survival (12 mg/L), body weight gain (4 and 12 mg/L), and food utilization efficiency (4 and 12 mg/L). Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis. FPF exposure (4 and 12 mg/L) led to oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activity. Notably, gene expression analysis indicated significant dysregulation of apoptosis, immune, detoxification, sucrose responsiveness and memory-related genes, suggesting the involvement of different pathways in FPF-induced toxicity.

The distribution of acetamiprid and its metabolites was monitored over a 72-h period in six biological compartments: head, thorax, abdomen, haemolymph, midgut and rectum. Honeybees were treated orally with 100 μg [14C]-acetamiprid kg-1 bee, a dose which is about 1500 times lower than the median lethal dose. After 72 h, only 40% of the total radioactivity was eliminated, suggesting that acetamiprid and its metabolites tended to persist in the honeybee. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed in all compartments and metabolized. Just after administration, radioactivity was mainly localized in the abdomen and subsequently in the rectum. After 72 h, the maximum amount of radioactivity (about 20% of the ingested dose) was detected again in the abdomen, whereas the lowest level of total radioactivity was detected in the haemolymph. Radioactivity in the head did not exceed 7.6% of total ingested radioactivity. More than 50% of acetamiprid was metabolised in less than 30 min, indicating a very short half-life for the compound. During the first hours, acetamiprid was mainly detected in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues: abdomen, thorax and head. Of the seven metabolites detected, the major ones were 6-choronicotinic acid and an unknown metabolite called U1, which was present mainly in the rectum, the thorax and the head.

We previously reported that a cis-configuration neonicotinoid (IPPA08) exhibited specific synergistic activity toward neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, we synthesized a series of structural analogues of IPPA08 by converting the pyridyl moiety of IPPA08 into phenyl groups, via facile double-Mannich condensation reactions between nitromethylene compounds and glutaraldehyde. All of the oxabridged neonicotinoid compounds were found to increase the toxicity of imidacloprid against Aphis craccivora. Notably, compound 25 at 0.75 mg/L lowered the LC50 value of imidacloprid against A. craccivora by 6.54-fold, while a 3.50-fold reduction of the LC50 value was observed for IPPA08. The results of bee toxicity test showed that compound 25 display selectivity in its effects on imidacloprid toxicity against the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.).

Previous reports have demonstrated the toxicity of this drug in activating oxidative stress resulting in high mortality in the honey bee Apis mellifera. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid have not been fully elucidated. In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload.

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data.

Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites.

119,JOUR,Characterisation of the heat shock protein Tid and its involvement in stress response regulation in Apis cerana,"['Li, G.', 'Zhang, C.', 'Wang, H.', 'Xia, W.', 'Zhang, X.', 'Liu, Z.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Zhao, H.', 'Xu, B.']",Frontiers in Physiology,"Objective: The impact of various environmental stresses on native Apis cerana cerana fitness has attracted intense attention in China. However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT–PCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40°C to 43°C and 46°C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown.

118,JOUR,Characteristics of AccSTIP1 in Apis cerana cerana and its role during oxidative stress responses,"['Zhai, N', 'Jia, HH', 'Ma, ML', 'Chao, YZ', 'Guo, XQ', 'Li, H']",CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES,"Various environmental stresses, such as heat shock, heavy metals, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and different pesticides, induce a cellular oxidative stress response. The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 degrees C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AccSTIP1 plays an important role in counteracting oxidative stress. This study lays a foundation for revealing the mechanism of AccSTIP1 in the Apis cerana cerana antioxidant system.",2018/11//,2018,10.1007/s12192-018-0920-3,23,6,1355-8145,WOS:000450531000003,1165.0,1176.0,,,,,0,,0,77

Multiple factors like parasites, pathogens and pesticides are dealt as possible drivers of honeybee losses. In particular, insecticides are considered as a major factor of pollinator poisoning. We applied sublethal concentrations of four insecticidal substances to honeybee larval food and analyzed the effects on transcriptome. The aim was to identify candidate genes indicating early negative impacts after application of insecticidal substances. Honeybee larvae were kept in-vitro under hive conditions (34–35 °C) and fed with dimethoate, fenoxycarb, chlorantraniliprole and flupyradifurone in sublethal concentrations between day 3–6 after grafting. Larvae at day 4, 6 and 8 were sampled and their transcriptome analyzed. By use of a RT-qPCR array differences in gene expression of selected gene families (immune system, development detoxification) were measured. Targets mainly involved in development, energy metabolism and the immune system were significantly affected by the insecticidal substances tested, selectively inducing genes of the detoxification system, immune response and nutritional stress. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104703,170,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090940536&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.104703&partnerID=40&md5=572b174a0c41dbad724b26d438d2a0f9,,"animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; bee; Bees; dimethoate; Dimethoate; genetics; insecticide; Insecticides; larva; Larva; Larvae; messenger RNA; RNA, Messenger; Sublethal dose; transcriptome; Transcriptome",,0,,0,78
210,JOUR,Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 µL for honeybees and to 2 µL for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower for the red mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. © 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,0,,0,79
166,JOUR,A Vitellogenin Antibody in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera): Characterization and Application as Potential Biomarker for Insecticide Exposure,"['Christen, V.', 'Vogel, M.S.', 'Hettich, T.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"The insect yolk precursor vitellogenin is a lipoglycoprotein synthesized and stored in the fat body and secreted into the hemolymph. In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees.

Its biological functions include modulating apoptosis, regulating the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells, supporting thrombosis and modulating insulin secretion. However, the roles of PDIA6 in Apis cerana cerana are poorly understood. Herein, we obtained the PDIA6 gene from A. cerana cerana (AccPDIA6). We investigated the expression patterns of AccPDIA6 in response to oxidative stress induced by H202, UV, HgC12, extreme temperatures (4 C, 42 C) and pesticides (thiamethoxam and hexythiazox) and found that AccPDIA6 was upregulated by these treatments. Western blot analysis indicated that AccPDIA6 was also upregulated by oxidative stress at the protein level. In addition, a survival test demonstrated that the survival rate of E. call cells expressing AccPDIA6 increased under oxidative stress, suggesting a possible antioxidant function of AccPDIA6. In addition, we tested the transcripts of other antioxidant genes and found that some of them were downregulated in AccPDIA6 knockdown samples. It was also discovered that the antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) decreased in AccPDIA6-silenced bees. Moreover, the survival rate of AccPDIA6 knockdown bees decreased under oxidative stress, implying that AccPDIA6 may function in the oxidative stress response by enhancing the viability of honeybees.

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals. Relevant future perspectives are briefly addressed to integrate MoA, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and toxicokinetic information for the refinement of single-chemical/combined toxicity predictions and risk estimates at different levels of biological organization in the bee health context.",2020/09/15/,2020,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139243,735,,0048-9697,WOS:000542562100009,,,,,,,0,,0,83

Here, multiple fluorescence spectra, thermodynamic method, and molecular docking were used to study the interaction and the functional inhibition of imidacloprid to the recombinant CSP1 protein in Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity (λem = 332 nm) of CSP1 could be significantly quenched by imidacloprid in a dynamic mode. During the quenching process, ΔH > 0, ΔS > 0, indicating that the acting forces of imidacloprid with CSP1 are mainly hydrophobic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the binding process. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the α-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain. In addition, the binding of CSP1 to floral scent β-ionone was inhibited by nearly 50% of the apparent association constant (KA) in the presence of 0.28–2.53 ng/bee of imidacloprid, and the inhibition rate of nearly 95% at 3.75 ng/bee of imidacloprid at sublethal dose level.

However, the lipids of their central nervous system have not been examined, even though they likely play a crucial role in the performance of cognitive process to perform intricate behaviors. Lipidomics has greatly advanced our understanding of neuropathologies in mammals and could provide the same for honey bees. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the brain lipidome of adult honey bees and to assess the effect of clothianidin (a neurotoxic insecticide) on the brain lipid composition, gene expression, and performance of self-grooming behavior under controlled conditions (cage experiments). Methods: After seven days of exposure to oral sublethal doses of clothianidin, the bees were assessed for self-grooming behavior; their brains were dissected to analyze the lipidome using an untargeted lipidomics approach and to perform a high throughput RNAseq analysis. Results: Compared to all other organisms, healthy bee brain lipidomes contain unusually high levels of alkyl-ether linked (plasmanyl) phospholipids (51.42%) and low levels of plasmalogens (plasmenyl phospholipids; 3.46%). This could make it more susceptible to the effects of toxins in the environment.

Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid altered PC 20:3e/15:0, PC 16:0/18:3, PA 18:0/24:1, and TG 18:1/18:1/18/1 levels, and affected gene expression linked to GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and energy metabolism that may be partially responsible for the altered lipid composition. Conclusion: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral disorders. © 2022",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jare.2021.08.007,37,,,,75.0,89.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113674681&doi=10.1016%2fj.jare.2021.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=3402264eaea4aabfd4c6f44eec4b5507,Scopus,"['Brain', 'Grooming', 'Honey bees', 'Lipidome', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Social immunity']",,0,,0,90

Haemolymph samples were observed immediately, thirty and sixty minutes after field recommended concentration exposure of five different insecticides. Total haemocyte counts were significantly higher for larvae and pupae but less for adult bees, however, differential haemocyte counts insignificantly different. Exposure of insecticides showed variable response for tested insecticides with immediate increased change with ethofenprox, diafenthiuron and imidacloprid but decreased for all tested insecticides after sixty minutes. For differential haemocyte counts, plasmatocytes and granulocytes increased with exposure of insecticides. Immune response of haemocytes against insecticides showed different degrees of abnormalities like agglutination, denucleation and cell shape distortion. Such studies may help in possible identification of insect defense mechanisms against their exposure to external hazards for instance insecticide exposure. (C) 2016 The Authors.

203,JOUR,A novel insecticide impairs bumblebee memory and sucrose responsiveness across high and low nutrition,"Gray, L.K.; Hulsey, M.; Siviter, H.",Royal Society Open Science,"Wild bees are important pollinators of crops and wildflowers but are exposed to a myriad of different anthropogenic stressors, such as pesticides and poor nutrition, as a consequence of intensive agriculture. These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'. This suggests that agrochemical risk assessments are not protecting pollinators from the unintended consequences of pesticide use.  © 2024 The Authors.",2024,2024,10.1098/rsos.231798,11,5,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193238788&doi=10.1098%2frsos.231798&partnerID=40&md5=03be6a6c1d0fb9c0f9bd68e75f929ef3,,bee behaviour; Bombus; interaction effects; pesticide; pollinators; poor nutrition,,0,,0,92

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2× deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Our findings suggest that additivity is a good baseline for predicting the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to bees, and that the rare cases of synergy of pesticide mixtures to bees are not random but have a mechanistic basis. © 2022 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159518,857,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140783605&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.159518&partnerID=40&md5=6f800aae18835c979ed4c168161574ac,Scopus,"['acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'additive', 'Additive effects', 'Additives', 'additivity', 'Additivity', 'additivity effect', 'additivity predictions', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'biological activity', 'clothianidin', 'coefficient of variation', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration addition', 'Concentration addition', 'concentration addition model', 'cyfluthrin', 'cyhalothrin', 'cypermethrin', 'deltamethrin', 'endosulfan', 'ethiprole', 'etofenprox', 'experimental cumulative distribution function', 'experimental design', 'experimental toxicity', 'exposure route', 'exposure time', 'fenpropidin', 'fipronil', 'fluoxastrobin', 'flupyradifurone', 'Food products', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Honey bee', 'honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'isoflucypram', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'methamidophos', 'methiocarb', 'mixture deviation ratio', 'mixtures', 'Mixtures', 'non additive effects', 'Non-additive', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'pesticides', 'Pesticides', 'physical parameters', 'prevalence', 'probability', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'spiromesifen', 'spirotetramat', 'spiroxamine', 'synergistic effect', 'synergy', 'Synergy', 'tebuconazole', 'tetraniliprole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiodicarb', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicological parameters', 'transfluthrin', 'triadimenol', 'unclassified drug']",,0,,0,94

While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid – IMI or thiamethoxam – THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), α-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (α-carotene and α-cryptoxanthin) and α-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees. This would merit further investigation as these compounds are important in various aspects of bees’ health. Overall, this study contributes to the development of biomonitoring tools for the health of bees and other pollinators. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018///,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-34625-y,8,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056067652&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-34625-y&partnerID=40&md5=d023147184001268f7cd12722e43fe07,Scopus,,,0,,0,96

Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)), then compared these RQs to a level of concern. For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees.

Insects rely on the innate immune system and thus any hindrance to phagocytosis may greatly affect their resistance to diseases and response to pathogens. The European honeybee, a valuable species due to its economic and environmental contribution, is being challenged by colony collapse disorder leading to its decline. Exposure to multiple factors including pesticides like imidacloprid and amitraz may negatively alter their immune response and ultimately make them more susceptible to diseases. In this study, we compare the effect of different concentrations and mixtures of imidacloprid and amitraz with different concentrations of the immune stimulant, zymosan A.

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-72041-3,10,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093829332&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-72041-3&partnerID=40&md5=a24ef869a003dc0e843503bf437dbbbc,Scopus,"['animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'circadian rhythm', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'honey', 'Honey', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory', 'Memory', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic agent', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'sleep', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Navigation', 'spatial orientation']",,0,,0,106

Esterases EST-3 and EST-4 (carboxylesterase) were partially inhibited after contamination by contact and ingestion of malathion and contamination by contact with thiamethoxam, suggesting participation of these esterases in the metabolization of these compounds. The lowest critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) was found after contamination by malathion ingestion (0.15 M), indicating changes in gene expression.

'wild blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133.0,140.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,0,,0,108

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure. This new approach to measure risk is more accurate and could become a tool to aid the decision-making process in the risk assessment of pesticides. © 2014 Poquet et al.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113728,9,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84913553440&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0113728&partnerID=40&md5=0bd734a30f96cf5929cbd058f27dc9d0,Scopus,,,0,,0,111

Since most previous studies on these pesticides are performed merely based on toxicity tests with individual active ingredients, only finite knowledge is available on the mixture toxicities of these formulated compounds to crop pollinators. In this study, we examined their toxicities of binary, ternary, quaternary, quinquenary, senary, septenary and octonary mixtures to honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) with feeding toxicity test. Results showed that EMB and ABA had the highest toxicities to A. mellifera with LC50 values of 0.033 (0.028–0.038) and 0.047 (0.039–0.056) μg a. i. mL−1 after exposure for 7 days, respectively, followed by DIC with an LC50 value of 1.22 (1.01–1.41) μg a. i. mL−1. In contrast, relatively low toxicities were found from pyrethroid insecticides, ACT, and TET with their LC50 values ranged from 44.76 (38.75–50.89) to 251.7 (198.4–297.3) μg a. i. mL−1. Most of pesticide mixtures containing ACT and TET elicited synergistic interactions to honey bees.

Among 98 tested binary to octonary mixtures of ACT in combination with seven pesticides, 44.90% of combinations exhibited synergistic effects on honey bees.

Firstly, the main insecticides for three stages of cotton growth were identified under the lateral mixing condition. Insecticides for the first phase included abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b), acetamiprid (N-(N-cyano-ethylimine)-N-methyl-2-chloropyridine-5-methylamine), dicofol (1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol) and cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester); the insecticides available in the second phase included cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), phoxim (O,O-diethyl-O-α-cyanophenylbenzylamine thiophosphate ester), deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester)-cyano-diphenyl ether) and abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b). In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-α-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicity by 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%. Finally, by calculating the resultant force from different types of non-bonded forces, the mechanism of the effect of the optimal application scheme on bees and pests under two scenarios was analyzed.

9,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. © 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118699937&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100051&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0e1bc03406e457bd1eb4d83cd26b7,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'Associative learning', 'Clothianidin', 'EMF', 'Flight']",,0,,0,119

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes. Trialling the framework in our study system, we found that our focal insecticide, thiacloprid, improved red clover seed yield with no detected effects on its key pollinator, B. terrestris, and that the presence of red clover in the landscape can benefit pollinator populations.",2022/09//,2022,10.1111/1365-2664.14244,59,9,0021-8901,WOS:000829713200001,2419.0,2429.0,,,"['bee', 'Bombus', 'conceptual framework', 'crop yield', 'flowering', 'herb', 'insecticide', 'mass-flowering crop', 'nectar', 'pesticide', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'red clover', 'trade-off', 'yield']",,0,,0,120

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,0,,0,121
97,JOUR,"Environmental impacts of reduced-risk and conventional pesticide programs differ in commercial apple orchards, but similarly influence pollinator community","['Joshi, NK', 'Leslie, T', 'Rajotte, EG', 'Biddinger, DJ']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Insect pollinators such as bees and syrphid flies play a crucial role in pollinating many food crops, and their diversity and abundance may be influenced by pesticide application patterns. Over three years, we assessed the ecotoxicological impacts on the diversity and abundance of bees and syrphid flies between reduced-risk pesticide programs and standard, conventional pesticide programs in paired plots at six spatially distinct commercial apple orchards. In particular, we quantified pesticide inputs, environmental impact, and community response of bees and syrphids to these pesticide programs. Relative environmental impacts of reduced-risk versus conventional pesticide programs were calculated using Environmental Impact Quotient analysis, while ecological impacts were characterized by assessing the abundance, richness, and species assemblages of bees and syrphids. Adopting a reduced-risk pesticide program for apple pest management reduced the use (in terms of kg a.i./ha) of organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides by approximately 97.6% and 100% respectively, but increased the use of neonicotinoid pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid) by 40.4% compared to the orchards under standard conventional pesticide program. Regardless of pesticide inputs, abundance, richness and species assemblages of bees and syrphids did not differ between reduced-risk and conventional pest management programs. However, the environmental impact of pesticide inputs was reduced by 89.8% in reduced-risk pesticide program. These findings suggest that the implementation of reduced-risk pesticide program may reduce pesticide environmental impact, in addition to being safer to farm workers, without adversely affecting the robust community composition of bees and syrphids in commercial apple orchards in the mid-Atlantic region.

Honeybees were treated orally with imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg-1 bee. Imidacloprid was metabolised relatively quickly and thoroughly. Twenty minutes after the beginning of imidacloprid ingestion, the sum of the residues from the three compounds amounted to only 70% of the actual given dose. Imidacloprid, 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin represented, respectively, 50%, 9% and 8% of the actual ingested dose. Six and 24h, respectively, after ingestion of imidacloprid at 20 and 50 μg kg -1 bee, imidacloprid could no longer be detected in the honeybee. Imidacloprid had a half-life ranging between 4.5 and 5h and was rapidly metabolised into 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin. Except 5-hydroxyimidacloprid in the 20 μg kg-1 treatment, these two metabolites presented a peak value 4h after ingestion of the 20 and 50 μg kg-1 doses. This time fully coincided with the appearance of mortality induced by imidacloprid after acute oral intoxication. These results suggested that the immediate neurotoxicity symptoms are due to the action of imidacloprid, whereas 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and/or olefin are involved in honeybee mortality. In addition, it was likely that the 30% of residues undetected 20min after intoxication were imidacloprid metabolites, although not 5-hydroxyimidacloprid or olefin.

To reduce population density of M. alternatus, thiacloprid has been sprayed by aircrafts on pine forests. Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not. Consequently, thiacloprid sprayed by aircraft may be an effective control agent for Monochamus beetle adults without negative effect on honey bees, but aerial application to prevent expansion of pine wilt disease should be reassessed. © 2020 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1111/1748-5967.12482,51,2,,,83.0,89.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092628018&doi=10.1111%2f1748-5967.12482&partnerID=40&md5=0c6befc5cec85b2189292ccf9729ab95,Scopus,"['Non-target insects', 'Pine wilt disease', 'Pine wood nematode', 'Toxicity']",,0,,0,125

One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field.

It was believed that the processing factor (PF) is an important variable to determine the final pesticide residue during royal jelly formation and the actual risk to honeybee larva. Hence, a QuEChERS method to determine acetamiprid contents in honeybee samples was established in this study. Then, the PFs for acetamiprid in beebread fermentation, honey brewing, and royal jelly formation were determined to be 0.85, 0.76, and 0.16, respectively. The PF for royal jelly formation was 0.04 when acetamiprid was detected in beebread alone, and it was 0.12 when acetamiprid was only detected in honey. Finally, the predicted exposure concentration of acetamiprid in royal jelly was calculated to be 2.05 µg/kg using the PF without significant difference with the 90th percentile value (3.64 µg/kg) in the actual sample. However, the value was 16.62 µg/kg without considering the PF.

Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee.

The experimental design consisted of in vitro co-incubation of bee gametes with three different concentrations of IMD 1, 10, and 25 μM for 15 min. Conventional microscopic and Computer-aided sperm analyses (CASA) were concomitantly used with a dual goal: to evaluate objectively the effects of IMD on sperm parameters on the one hand and to report computer kinematic parameters in the control group, without IMD treatment, on the other hand. The results revealed apparent negative effects in a dose-dependent manner with motility collapsing completely at 25 μM of IMD. The current results highlighted the direct impact of IMD on bee spermatozoa and revealing the potential subsequent effects on bee reproduction. This study reported also drone computer sperm parameters that could serve as a reference in the studied region.

Currently, the number of pollinators is decreasing worldwide, which is attributed mostly to the widespread use of pesticides. The aim of this work was to develop a method for assessing the genotoxicity of pesticides for the Bombus terrestris L. bumblebee using long-range PCR of mitochondrial DNA fragments. We have developed a panel of primers and assessed the genotoxicity of the following pesticides: imidacloprid, rotenone, deltamethrin, difenocanozole, malathion, metribuzin, penconazole, esfenvalerate, and dithianon. All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA. The mtDNA damage was observed for all studied pesticides. Most of the studied pesticides caused significant damage to mtDNA in vitro and in vivo when ingested. Our results indicate that all tested pesticides, including herbicides and fungicides, can have a toxic effect on pollinators. However, the extent of pesticide-induced mtDNA damage in the flight muscles was significantly less upon the contact compared to the oral administration. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104675,169,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089444308&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.104675&partnerID=40&md5=165343f8a589c2deeac699de35290eee,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bumblebees', 'DNA damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Long-range PCR', 'Method', 'Mitochondria', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mitochondrion', 'mtDNA', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollination', 'Pollination']",,0,,0,133

Images are continuously acquired at the beehive entrance, and the honey bees in the images are segmented and detected using the background subtraction method. Tracking of honey bees is achieved using an integrated Kalman Filter and Hungarian algorithm tracking method. The tracking algorithm was used to determine the incoming and outgoing activity of individual honey bees with an automatic counting accuracy of 93.9 ± 1.1% in comparison with manual counting. The in-and-out activity and environmental information from sensors were transmitted to a remote server via a 4G LTE router for later analyses. To evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the system, the imaging systems were installed in multiple beehives, and designed experiments were carried out. The experiments involved long-term monitoring to assess the pesticide effects on honey bee behaviors by treating the beehives with different concentrations of imidacloprid pesticides. Using the in-and-out activities information collected, indices were further derived and analyzed. The information obtained from the experiments was used to assess the health conditions of the honey bee colonies monitored. Different measurement results such as hourly and daily frequencies of honey bees’ in-and-out activity under different conditions were presented. The developed imaging system is cost effective and can be used as a useful tool for long-term monitoring of the health and activity of honey bee colonies and to further analyze behavior traits of honey bees. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.compag.2019.05.050,163,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067192625&doi=10.1016%2fj.compag.2019.05.050&partnerID=40&md5=f11d5802334b0df88d49827c9c7913b7,Scopus,,,0,,0,135

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybees’ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. © 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,4,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187202591&doi=10.3390%2fani14040608&partnerID=40&md5=bee8613fa13ab09e8899b833165a5703,Scopus,"['animal health and welfare', 'aphid', 'Article', 'bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF)', 'bergamot oil', 'colony forming unit', 'diet supplementation', 'Escherichia coli', 'flupyradifurone', 'food intake', 'honeybee', 'honeybee (Apis mellifera)', 'insecticide', 'intoxication', 'LC50', 'mass spectrometry', 'mortality rate', 'natural products', 'nonhuman', 'pilot study', 'poisoning', 'pollination', 'psyllid', 'Salmonella', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography', 'unclassified drug', 'whitefly']",,0,,0,137

Cropland agriculture and the corresponding use of agricultural pesticides may contribute to these declines, while increased pollinator habitat (flowering plants) can help mitigate them. Here we tested whether the relative effect of wildflower plantings on pollinator diversity and counts were modified by proportion of nearby agricultural land cover and pesticide exposure in 24 conserved grasslands in Iowa, USA. Compared with general grassland conservation practices, wildflower plantings led to only a 5% increase in pollinator diversity and no change in counts regardless of the proportion of cropland agriculture within a 1 km radius. Pollinator diversity increased earlier in the growing season and with per cent flower cover. Unexpectedly, neither insecticide nor total pesticide concentrations on above-ground passive samplers were related to pollinator diversity. However, pollinator community composition was most strongly related to date of sampling, total pesticide concentration, and forb or flower cover. Our results indicate very little difference in pollinator diversity between grassland conservation practices with and without wildflower plantings.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ≤ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ≤10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. © 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,0,,0,141

However, we have previously shown that mitochondrial damage induced by neonicotinoids can be corrected by 670nm light exposure. But we do not know if this protection extends to immunity or what the minimum effective level of 670nm light exposure is necessary for protection. We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph. Further, this single 1 min exposure remains effective for 3–6 days. Longer exposures were not more effective.

Thus, a particular attention should be paid to their protection, not only for their ecological importance by contributing to the maintenance of wild plant diversity, but also for their economic value as honey producers and crop-pollinating agents. For all these reasons, the environmental protection requires the resort of risk assessment of pesticides. The goal of this work was therefore to develop a validated QSAR model to predict contact acute toxicity (LD50) of 111 pesticides to bees because the QSAR models devoted to this species are very scarce. The analysis of the statistical parameters of this model and those published in the literature shows that our model is more efficient.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449.0,461.0,,,,,0,,0,145

We also tested the pea aphid, Acyrthasiphon pisum (Harris), to calculate selectivity ratios for these beneficial species, which coexist with the aphid pest in Washington State pea and alfalfa ecosystems. Topical toxicity was estimated for all species and ranged 0.0002-0.45 micrograms per insect for diazinon, 0.000031-0.04 micrograms per insect for imidacloprid, and 0.0015-6.11 micrograms per insect for RH-7988. Selectivity ratios based on these values spanned 0.02-47.4, 12.9-1,290.3, and 13.3-4,073 for diazinon, imidacloprid, and RH-7988, respectively. Risk assessment indices based on probit substitution (estimate of mortality of beneficial species at LD(90) for the pest) and 2 standard methods for bees, a sequential testing scheme and a hazard index gave variable predictions of the compatibility of these compounds with integrated pest management. We conclude that predictive methods must advance to consider relative exposure rates to pesticides, aspects of chemical fate, and behavior of the organisms concerned if they are to be useful.

The results demonstrate that IMD exposure did not affect sperm concentration; however, there were significant differences in concentration within colonies. IMD exposure was associated with reductions in sperm motility, which also varied within colonies.

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae), are heavily affected by pest control practices that incorporate insecticides. Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016/04//,2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,2,0022-0493,WOS:000374497000004,515.0,519.0,,,,,0,,0,154

A wide variety of insecticides are used to manage D. citri populations within citrus groves in Florida. However, in areas shared by citrus growers and beekeepers the use of insecticides may increase the risks of Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) loss and contaminated honey. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri. Diflubenzuron was not toxic to A. mellifera in the field as compared with untreated control plots. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity of A. mellifera was higher than in untreated controls when A. mellifera were exposed to 14 days old residues.

In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees. Measures should be taken to manage the environmental risk of pesticide adjuvants during the process of formulation development and registration.

178,JOUR,Neonicotinoid contamination in conservation areas affects bees more sharply than beetles,"['Tetlie, J.', 'Harmon-Threatt, A.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The neurotoxic insecticide class of neonicotinoids has become one of the most widely used groups of pesticides globally. Their long half-lives and high water solubility increase their potential to linger and affect numerous organisms long after application. A prominent concern associated with residual contamination is the negative impact that neonicotinoids can have on beneficial arthropods such as bees and certain groups of beetles. Many studies have looked at the effects neonicotinoids have on arthropod communities in lab settings; however, comparatively few studies have looked at these groups in neonicotinoid-contaminated restored prairie habitats. These habitats are often restored from or located near agriculture and are almost ubiquitously contaminated with neonicotinoids. Our one-year manipulated field study compared native bee nesting rates and beetle community assemblages between paired clothianidin-contaminated and non-contaminated restored prairie plots. Native bee nesting probability and nesting abundance increased by 46% and 172%, respectively, in sites contaminated with clothianidin. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in beetle family assemblages, abundance, or richness between clothianidin-contaminated and control sites. These results suggest that neonicotinoid contamination of natural habitats can have numerous environmental consequences for arthropods and that these effects are not always consistent between taxa. Understanding how neonicotinoid contamination affects beneficial groups such as bees and arthropod community assemblages is crucial for characterizing the risks these chemicals pose to ecologically imperative taxa.

In this study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicities of CYA and SUL on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae reared in vitro. RESULTS: In the acute toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the median lethal dose (LD50): CYA 0.007, 0.014, 0.028, 0.056 and 0.112 μg larva−1; SUL 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μg larva−1. In the chronic toxicity test, the following test doses were used to determine the LD50: CYA 0.00512, 0.0128, 0.032, 0.08 and 0.2 μg larva−1; SUL 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 μg larva−1. The acute LD50 values of CYA and SUL were 0.047 and 11.404 μg larva−1, respectively. Larvae acutely exposed to SUL had significantly lower body weight than controls, but those exposed to CYA showed no difference. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and LD50 values of the chronic toxicity tests for each insecticide were 0.00512 and 0.064 μg larva−1 for CYA, and 0.0625 μg larva−1 and 0.212 μg larva−1 for SUL, respectively. Larvae chronically exposed to SUL emerged as bees with deformed wings, reaching adult deformation rates of over 50%; however, CYA had no effect on adult deformation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to CYA increased larval mortality but did not cause any adult deformation, whereas SUL exposure increased pupal mortality and caused wing deformation in newly emerged bees.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that simultaneous exposure to DMT and FLU doses has on bee health. Groups of twenty honeybees were housed in cages to compose six macro-groups. One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticides’ interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for up to three days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day. When DMT and FLU 50 were administered together, the group that received DMT alone had a lower survival rate. When comparing the survival rates produced by the DMT and FLU 50 combination to those of the group receiving FLU 50 alone, the same was clearly visible. While there was no statistically significant improvement observed when the survival indices of the DMT and FLU 100 combination were compared to those of the group intoxicated with DMT alone, an improvement in survival indices was observed when these were compared with the group intoxicated with FLU 100 alone. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024,10.3390/ani14060851,14,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188842192&doi=10.3390%2fani14060851&partnerID=40&md5=daea9e86a4f794dca079f939b6438c45,,abnormal behavior; adult; animal experiment; animal health and welfare; animal model; antagonism; antagonistic effect; Article; beekeeping; deltamethrin; drug interaction; environment; flupyradifurone; food intake; honeybee; honeybee (Apis mellifera); in vitro study; intoxication; nonhuman; pest control; pesticide; pesticides; plant pest control; plants; survival rate; unclassified drug,,0,,0,162

The loss of pollinating insects is of particular concern because of the ecological and economic values these species provide. The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was once common in western North America, but this species has become increasingly rare through much of its range. To understand potential mechanisms driving these declines, we used Bayesian occupancy models to investigate the effects of climate and land cover from 1998 to 2020, pesticide use from 2008 to 2014, and projected expected occupancy under three future scenarios. Using 14,457 surveys across 2.8 million km2 in the western United States, we found strong negative relationships between increasing temperature and drought on occupancy and identified neonicotinoids as the pesticides of greatest negative influence across our study region. The mean predicted occupancy declined by 57% from 1998 to 2020, ranging from 15 to 83% declines across 16 ecoregions. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we found continued declines in nearly half of the ecoregions by the 2050s and mean declines of 93% under the most severe scenario across all ecoregions. This assessment underscores the tenuous future of B. occidentalis and demonstrates the scale of stressors likely contributing to rapid loss of related pollinator species throughout the globe.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006–0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003–0.0006) μg active ingredient (a.i.) bee−1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata.

Treatment also impacted precopulatory behavior and male quality assessment by females. Males approached unexposed females more quickly than insecticide-exposed ones. Females exposed to insecticide produced lower amounts of some cuticular hydrocarbons (sex pheromone candidates) and appeared less choosy than unexposed females.

As such, the evolutionary lineages of the honey bee colonies were identified, a multiresidue analysis of xenobiotics was carried out in beebread and worker bee samples, and the Toxic Unit (TUm) was estimated for each sampled apiary. The relationship between lineages and the most prevalent pathogens (Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, trypanosomatids, Black Queen Cell Virus; and Deformed Wing Virus) was analysed with contingency tables, and the possible relationships between TUm and the prevalence of these pathogens were studied by using a factor analysis. The statistical analysis supported the associations between V. destructor and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), and between N. ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), but the association between these pathogens and trypanosomatids was not observed. TUm values varied between 5.5 × 10−6 and 3.65 × 10−1. When TUm < 3.35 × 10−4, it was mainly determined by coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and/or chlorfenvinphos.

To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ∼10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae.

Toxicity information for a variety of species is documented and utilized, environmental concentrations estimated, and risk characterizations in the form of risk quotients are quantified. Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict offsite transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species.

164,JOUR,Improving Mitochondrial Function Protects Bumblebees from Neonicotinoid Pesticides,"['Powner, MB', 'Salt, TE', 'Hogg, C', 'Jeffery, G']",PLOS ONE,"Global pollination is threatened by declining insect pollinator populations that may be linked to neonicotinoid pesticide use. Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria, producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed. Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure were withdrawn, survival was maintained.

Beekeepers send samples to analytical laboratories, but sometimes no residues can be detected. Temperature and sun light could influence the decrease of pesticides in bee samples and thereby residues left for analysis. Moreover, samples are usually sent via normal postal services without cooling. We investigated the temporal dynamics of whole-body residues of imidacloprid in live or dead honeybees following a single-meal dietary exposure of 41 ng/bee under various environmental conditions, such as freezing, exposure to UV light or transfer of individuals through the mail system. Immobile, ""dead"" looking honeybees recovered from paralysis after 48 hours. The decrease of residues in living but paralysed bees was stopped by freezing (= killing). UV light significantly reduced residues, but the mode of transport did not affect residue levels. Group feeding increased the variance of residues, which is relevant for acute oral toxicity tests. In conclusion, elapsed time after poisoning is key for detection of neonicotinoids. Freezing before mailing significantly reduced the decrease of imidacloprid residues and may increase the accuracy of laboratory analysis for pesticides.",2017/07/24/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-06259-z,7,,2045-2322,WOS:000406260800001,,,,,,,0,,0,176

We measured sonication frequency, sonication length, and flight (wing beat) frequency of marked bees collecting pollen from Solanum lycopsersicum (tomato), and then randomly assigned bees to consume 0, 0.0515, 0.515, or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid. We recorded the number of bees in each treatment group that resumed sonication behavior after consuming imidacloprid, and re-measured sonication and flight behavior for these bees. We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515 ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15 ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid.

Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.",2015/09//,2015,10.1111/2041-210X.12416,6,9,2041-210X,WOS:000362916100007,1034.0,1043.0,,,,,0,,0,180

6,JOUR,Imidacloprid Pesticide Causes Unexpectedly Severe Bioelement Deficiencies and Imbalance in Honey Bees Even at Sublethal Doses,"['Paleolog, J.', 'Wilde, J.', 'Gancarz, M.', 'Wiącek, D.', 'Nawrocka, A.', 'Strachecka, A.']",Animals,"Pesticides impair honeybee health in many ways. Imidacloprid (IMD) is a pesticide used worldwide. No information exists on how IMD impact the bees’ body bioelement balance, which is essential for bee health. We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

158,JOUR,Examination of mass honey bee death at the entrance to hives in a paddy rice production district in Japan: The influence of insecticides sprayed on nearby rice fields,"['Kimura, K.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Saiou, K.', 'Nirasawa, K.', 'Ishizaka, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Beekeepers in Japan have been finding as many as 1,000 dead honey bees piled up in front of hive entrances. They have observed that these mass bee deaths tend to occur at about the same time as measures are taken to control rice bugs, which appear every year during the summer in rice-producing districts. We set up and conducted controlled field studies from July to August in 2012 in a rice-producing district of northern Japan where frequent mass bee deaths are observed each summer. As had occurred in the area in previous years, and as we directly observed during our field investigations, masses of honey bees were found dead at the entrance to their hives. Samples of pollen and honey bee corpses were found to contain measurable concentrations of five active ingredients of insecticides: clothianidin, dinotefuran, ethiprole, etofenprox, and phenthoate. Insecticides containing these active ingredients are known to have been used for rice bug control in this area. Furthermore, we did not observe other known honey bee death agents in the area, such as mites and hornets. Thus, we suspected that the phenomenon of ""piled honey bee death"" (PD) at hive entrances is related to the influence of insecticides used to control rice bugs in paddies. The insecticide concentrations in dead honey bees were, however, extremely low compared with the median lethal dose (LD50) for honey bees. Moreover, PD was observed after rice anthesis, when bees would be collecting pollen from flowering plants other than rice. This calls into question any direct link between mass bee death and insecticides. Further study is necessary to understand insecticide exposure routes and the actual mechanism of the PD phenomenon. © IBRA 2014",2014///,2014,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.12,53,5,,,599.0,606.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920153258&doi=10.3896%2fIBRA.1.53.5.12&partnerID=40&md5=ba4eacfa3b5fbbadcfd183d8440f1dd9,Scopus,,,0,,0,185

We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution.

173,JOUR,High pesticide exposure and risk to bees in pollinator plantings adjacent to conventionally managed blueberry fields,"['Graham, KK', 'McArt, S', 'Isaacs, R']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Wildflower plantings adjacent to agricultural fields provide diverse floral resources and nesting sites for wild bees. However, their proximity to pest control activities in the crop may result in pesticide exposure if pesticides drift into pollinator plantings. To quantify pesticide residues in pollinator plantings, we sampled flowers and soil from pollinator plantings and compared them to samples from unenhanced field margins and crop row middles. At conventionally managed farms, flowers from pollinator plantings had similar exposure profiles to those from unenhanced field margins or crop row middles, with multiple pesticides and high and similar risk quotient (RQ) values (with pollinator planting RQ: 3.9; without pollinator planting RQ: 4.0). Whereas samples from unsprayed sites had significantly lower risk (RQ: 0.005). Soil samples had overall low risk to bees. Additionally, we placed bumble bee colonies ( Bombus impatiens ) in field margins of crop fields with and without pollinator plantings and measured residues in bee -collected pollen. Pesticide exposure was similar in pollen from sites with or without pollinator plantings, and risk was generally high (with pollinator planting RQ: 0.5; without pollinator planting RQ: 1.1) and not significant between the two field types. Risk was lower at sites where there was no pesticide activity (RQ: 0.3), but again there was no significant difference between management types. The insecticide phosmet, which is used on blueberry farms for control of Drosophila suzukii , accounted for the majority of elevated risk. Additionally, analysis of pollen collected by bumble bees found no significant difference in floral species richness between sites with or without pollinator plantings. Our results suggest that pollinator plantings do not reduce pesticide risk and do not increase pollen diversity collected by B. impatiens , further highlighting the need to reduce exposure through enhanced IPM adoption, drift mitigation, and removal of attractive flowering weeds prior to insecticide applications.",2024/04/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171248,922,,0048-9697,WOS:001222172400001,,,,,,,0,,0,191

To assess risk in acute and chronic exposure scenarios in Cucurbita and field crops, concentrations of clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid (neonicotinoids) and chlorantraniliprole (anthranilic diamide) in cropped soil were plotted to produce an environmental exposure distribution for each insecticide. The probability of exceedance of several exposure endpoints (LC50s) was compared to an acceptable risk threshold (5%). In Cucurbita crops, under acute exposure, risk to hoary squash bees was below 5% for honey bee LC50s for all residues evaluated but exceeded 5% for clothianidin and imidacloprid using a solitary bee LC50. For Cucurbita crops in the chronic exposure scenario, exposure risks for clothianidin and imidacloprid exceeded 5% for all endpoints, and exposure risk for chlorantraniliprole was below 5% for all endpoints. In field crops, risk to ground-nesting bees was high from clothianidin in all exposure scenarios and high for thiamethoxam and imidacloprid under chronic exposure scenarios.

190,JOUR,Bee Pollinator Mortality Due to Pesticide-Laden Particulate Matter from Beef Cattle Feedyards,"['Green, F.B.', 'Peterson, E.M.', 'Emert, A.D.', 'Subbiah, S.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Environmental Science and Technology,"Wild and managed bees are critical for the stability of trophic webs, angiosperm reproduction, and agricultural productivity. Unfortunately, as many as 40% of crop pollinators are in a steep decline due to habitat loss and exposure to agrochemicals. Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40). Concurrent, colocated total suspended particulate matter samples contained multiple insecticides and parasiticides including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones, in significantly higher concentrations downwind of feedyards (bifenthrin, 8.45 ± 4.92; permethrin, 1032.34 ± 740.76; clothianidin, 3.61 ± 1.48; imidacloprid, 73.32 ± 47.52; thiamethoxam, 5.81 ± 3.16; abamectin, 0.45 ± 0.29; ivermectin, 8.88 ± 5.06 ng/g). Honeybees and mason bees sited downwind of feedyards always experienced higher mortality than those correspondingly sited upwind, and male mason bees experienced significantly higher mortality compared to females when both were sited downwind. Bees occurring downwind of beef cattle feedyards for 1 h are 232-260% more likely to die than those occurring upwind. Thus, agrochemicals used on and emitted from beef cattle feedyards are significant threats to bee pollinators. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",2023///,2023,10.1021/acs.est.3c03135,57,40,,,14839.0,14848.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172274460&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.3c03135&partnerID=40&md5=0b7afd64c1c6444b9f23500b2d0b73dd,Scopus,"['abamectin', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'agrochemicals', 'Agrochemicals', 'angiosperm', 'animal', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee pollinator', 'bee pollinators', 'Beef', 'beef cattle', 'Beef cattle feedyards', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'bovine', 'Cattle', 'Cell proliferation', 'clothianidin', 'environmental exposure', 'Esters', 'feeding behavior', 'Feedyard', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee', 'honeybees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'insecticides', 'Insecticides', 'ivermectin', 'lactone', 'Lactones', 'Macrocyclic lactones', 'male', 'Male', 'Mason bee', 'mason bees', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Parasiticide', 'parasiticides', 'Particles (particulate matter)', 'particulate matter', 'Particulate Matter', 'permethrin', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'Pyrethroids', 'suspended particulate matter', 'thiamethoxam', 'toxicity']",,0,,0,196

The study disclosed that H. armigera (larvae) crossed ETL (Economic Threshold Level) from 10th SW (Standard Week), warranting application of pest management measures. Many pollinator species were observed foraging on sunflowers during the same time. The least foraging by pollinators was recorded in early morning and late evening hours, depicting avoidance of insecticide application when pollinator foraging activity is maximum. A combination of synthetic and bio-insecticides (Chlorantraniliprole, Bt-kurstaki, Emamectin-benzoate, Spinosad, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Novaluron, and Neem-oil) were tested for their efficacy against H. armigera and impact on foraging behaviour of pollinators. Bio-insecticide-treated plots recorded significantly higher number of foraging pollinators as compared to synthetic-insecticide-treated plots. Of the insecticides used, Chlorantraniliprole showed highest efficacy against H. armigera but recorded lowest foraging activity of pollinators in both the years of study.

Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed.

The pesticide use status was evaluated by the recommended and actual applied dose and risk quotient (RQ) based Bee-REX model was used to assess the exposure risks of pesticide to bees based on the collected pesticide application data. The results showed that over half (52 %) of farmers in selected sites misused pesticides and orchard owners were frequently misused pesticides. Positive correlations were found between pesticide usage performance and farmers' specialized training experience. Pesticides applied in orchards have caused higher exposure risks to bees with the mean of RQs exceed 120 and 1880 via acute contact and dietary routes, respectively. Pesticide misuse significantly elevates the exposure risk to bees that the mean RQ under misuse scenarios was 5.8 times than that of correct use.

The highest repellency in outdoors/indoors experiments was observed using the solution with formulations of pesticide Horizon 250 EW (a. c. tebuconazole)–96.5%/99% and Nurelle D (a. c. chlorpyriphos-cypermethrin) 88%/97%, and the lowest repellency was observed for solution with formulations of Plenum (a. c. pymetrozine)–19.2%/27.8%, Mospilan 20 SP (a. c. acetamiprid)–20%/23.8%. The most repellent pesticides were diluted to half and a quarter of the recommended dose. The reducing of the active ingredient concentration improved attractiveness to honey bees, especially with Trebon OSR (74.3% for half dose and 55.8 for quarter dose) and Nurelle D (77.8% for half dose and 66.7 for quarter dose). However, a quarter dose of Horizon 250 EW did not show any substantial change in repellency (90.7%). Further investigations in field conditions will be done. © 2019 International Bee Research Association.",2021///,2021,10.1080/00218839.2019.1702322,60,2,,,270.0,276.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077094569&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2019.1702322&partnerID=40&md5=93b60324a99d0646928752f79561faf4,Scopus,"['attractiveness', 'feeding stations', 'free-choice trials', 'fungicides', 'honey solution', 'insect-proof fly-through hall', 'insecticides', 'toxicity']",,0,,0,204

Traps were placed outside the fields, at the field edges, and 10 and 30 m into the fields. We collected 756 bees representing 58 species, with Lasioglossum spp. comprising 73% of all captured bees. We found seven Bombus spp., of which B. impatiens was the only known visitor of potato flowers in our region. The majority of the bees (68%) were collected at the field edges and in the field margins. Blue vane traps caught almost four-times as many bees and collected 30% more species compared to bowl traps. Bee communities did not differ across trap locations but they were different among trap types. We tested B. impatiens visitation to neonicotinoid treated and untreated potato flowers in field enclosures. The amount of time bees spent at flowers and the duration of visits were not significantly different between the two treatments. Our results demonstrate that a diverse assemblage of bees is associated with an agroecosystem dominated by potatoes despite the apparent lack of pollinator resources provided by the crop. We found no difference in B. impatiens foraging behavior on neonicotinoid-treated compared to untreated plants.",2017/03//,2017,10.3390/insects8010030,8,1,2075-4450,WOS:000398717700029,,,,,,,0,,0,205

In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes, bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed. Based on these results we can conclude that a split application of Actara applied in drip irrigation to the soil/substrate has no effect on the bumble-bees used in tomatoes for pollination.",2005///,2005,,70,4,,,569.0,579.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745798661&partnerID=40&md5=d8a930dc5880ca2de44efbbf6727867e,Scopus,,,0,,0,206
191,JOUR,Autumn intermediate crops and development of honey-bee colonies,"['Gallot, M.', 'Buchwalder, G.', 'Beuret, B.', 'Cecilio, J.-M.', 'Guinemer, M.', 'Marigo, P.', 'Frosini, S.', 'Charrière, J.-D.']",Agrarforschung Schweiz,"Establishing an autumn vegetation cover following the grain harvests is common practice in the farming community. Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. © 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

96,JOUR,Influence of pesticide use in fruit orchards during blooming on honeybee mortality in 4 experimental apiaries,"['Calatayud-Vernich, P', 'Calatayud, F', 'Simó, E', 'Suarez-Varela, MM', 'Picó, Y']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Samples of dead honey bees (Apismellifera L.) were collected periodically from4 different locations during citrus and stone fruit trees blooming season to evaluate the potential impact of agrochemicals on honey bee death rate. For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental hives entrance located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against varroosis in the experimental hives, was detected in 94% of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80% of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68% dimethoate, and 32% imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223 ng/g respectively. Influence of these pesticides on acute honey beemortalitywas demonstrated by comparing coincidence between death rate and concentrations of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and imidacloprid.

163,JOUR,Is pollinator visitation of Helianthus annuus (sunflower) influenced by cultivar or pesticide treatment?,"['Stejskalová, M.', 'Konradyová, V.', 'Suchanová, M.', 'Kazda, J.']",Crop Protection,"Beneficial insects, such as Apis mellifera (honey bees) and Bombus sp. (bumble bees), play important roles in the environment as pollinators, and they are directly affected by agronomical practices, such as pesticide spraying or the selection of crop cultivar. Sunflower is an important resource for these pollinators, and its yield is highly dependent on pollination. Six sunflower hybrid cultivars (ES Biba, Gonzalo, Drake, Vellox, NK Neoma, and P63LE10) were used to compare the visitation rates (VR) of pollinators during flowering in three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). From this set, cultivar P63LE10 was selected to evaluate how pesticide treatments (mixture of two insecticide products containing acetamiprid and pirimicarb, respectively, and two fungicide products containing propiconazole plus prochloraz and dimoxystrobin plus boscalid, respectively) affect pollinator visitation. The amount of pesticide residue in sunflower inflorescences was analyzed to determine the content over the duration of the experiments. The sunflower cultivar P63LE10 was significantly the most attractive to both groups of pollinators in 2017. This cultivar was visited by the highest number of honey bees also in the other years. For bumble bees, cultivar P63LE10, along with cultivars NK Neoma and Vellox, had the highest visitation rates in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, plants treated by the fungicide dimoxystrobin plus boscalid had the highest visitation rates for both groups of pollinators. For bumble bees plants treated with this fungicide were significantly more visited (VR 23.1 ± 2.1%) than these treated with insecticide with pirimicarb (16.4 ± 2%) and the untreated control (17.9 ± 1.7%), and for honey bees plants treated with dimoxystrobin plus boscalid were significantly more visited (VR 24 ± 4.5%) than all other treatments except with acetamiprid (20.5 ± 3.5%). The residues of tested pesticides were found in blooms for the whole time of the experiment (range of values for 2016 and 2017 [ng/g]: acetamiprid 144–6, 3360–56; pirimicarb 177–12, 223–10; prochloraz 380–6, 1970–912; propiconazole 324–17, 1024–1018; boscalid 216–154, 9600–1319; dimoxystrobin 452–137, 6560–911). The influence of cultivar was more important than pesticide treatment in the selection of a preferred food source by pollinators. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.cropro.2018.08.018,114,,,,83.0,89.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051674523&doi=10.1016%2fj.cropro.2018.08.018&partnerID=40&md5=4b9adee90fe1ffa5e60ccac04c9ae74b,Scopus,,,0,,0,209
192,JOUR,Agri-environment schemes enhance pollinator richness and abundance but bumblebee reproduction depends on field size,"['Geppert, C', 'Hass, A', 'Földesi, R', 'Donkó, B', 'Akter, A', 'Tscharntke, T', 'Batary, P']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pollinators have experienced a dramatic decrease world-wide due to agricultural intensification. In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",2020/09//,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13682,57,9,0021-8901,WOS:000543973300001,1818.0,1828.0,,,,,0,,0,210
183,JOUR,Native vegetation embedded in landscapes dominated by corn and soybean improves honey bee health and productivity,"['Zhang, G', 'Murray, CJ', 'Clair, ALS', 'Cass, RP', 'Dolezal, AG', 'Schulte, LA', 'Toth, AL', ""O'Neal, ME""]",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Balancing demand for food while supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in landscapes committed to crop production may require integrating conservation with agriculture. Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

Dead honey bees were only collected and analyzed when significant mortality episodes occurred and pesticide content in beeswax of each experimental apiary was evaluated at the beginning of the study. Samples were extracted by a modified QuEChERS procedure and screened for pesticides residues by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pesticide hazard in the samples was evaluated through the hazard quotient approach (HQ). Beebread was widely contaminated with coumaphos and amitraz degradate 2, 4-dimethylphenylformamide (DMF), miticides detected in 94 and 97% of samples respectively. However, insecticides sprayed during citrus bloom like chlorpyrifos (up to 167 ng g −1)and dimethoate (up to 34 ng g −1)were the main responsible of the relevant pesticide hazard in this matrix. Pesticide levels in live bees were mostly residual, and pesticide hazard was low. Beeswax of the apiaries, contaminated by miticides, revealed a low pesticide hazard to honey bee colonies. Acute mortality episodes occurred only in the two apiaries located near agricultural settings. Dead bees collected during these episodes revealed high levels (up to 2700 ng g −1)of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, omethoate and imidacloprid.
