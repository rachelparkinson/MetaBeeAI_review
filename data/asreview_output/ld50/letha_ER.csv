In Brazil, stingless bees are responsible for 40% to 90% of tree species pollination, depending on the considered ecosystem. However, their survival has been threatened since the country has been standing out as a big consumer of pesticides. Many of the pesticides used are considered toxic to bees, including imidacloprid. Although the bees are not the target of these substances, they are highly vulnerable to contamination. Thereby, the objective of this study was to establish the mean lethal dose (LD50) and the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid for the M. Scutellaris. In order to carry out this experiment, bees were collected and the test was performed according to OECD's protocol (1998a, 1998b), developed for A. mellifera. For the determination of LD50 and LC50, data was analyzed through the Probit method. The topical LD50 established in this study was 2.41 ng/bee for 24 hours and 1.29 ng/bee for 48 hours. The oral LC50 was 2.01 ng i.a./ŒºL for 24 hours and 0.81 ng i.a./ŒºL for 48 hours. Thus, it is important to establish management methods which take this higher susceptibility into account to protect native species.",2015///,2015,10.13102/sociobiology.v62i4.792,62,4,578,582,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953716373&doi=10.13102%2fsociobiology.v62i4.792&partnerID=40&md5=aae2b84354f37183e15489b22f97bb39,Scopus,,,,,,1,

Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25 medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50 were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively. For Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, topical and oral LD50 were 0.244 mu g/bee and 0.056 mu g/bee, respectively. For Spinosad, the oral LD50 corresponded to 0.28 mu g/bee; it was not possible to establish the LD50 for the contact route. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Index of Relative Toxicity indicated that all three active ingredients are highly toxic.

633,JOUR,Low concentrations of imidacloprid affect the survival of Tetragona clavipes in a short period of exposure (24¬†h),"['de Oliveira, A.A.', 'Carvalho, L.O.', 'dos Santos, H.V.R.', 'de Oliveira, L.R.G.R.', 'Saraiva, A.S.']",Apidologie,"Neonicotinoid pesticides are widely used to control insect pests in agriculture and livestock production. However, they have been found to negatively affect bees, especially Apis mellifera. Despite this, little research has been conducted on the impact of neonicotinoids on other bee species, including native ones. This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI). The Tetragona clavipes (bee native to Brazil) were exposed to eight concentrations of IMI-based insecticide, through contaminated food or mist (350 ¬µL/min) for 24¬†h. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, LC90-24¬†h in acute topical effect (ATE) and¬†acute residual effect (ARE)¬†of IMI-based insecticide against bees were calculated. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, and LC90-24¬†h in ARE were found to be more toxic compared to ATE. In summary, the study highlights that even low levels of IMI can significantly reduce bee survival within 24¬†h. The urgency to tackle the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on native bee populations is evident. Preserving bees is crucial for ensuring sustainability, food security, and ecosystem integrity.

After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively). The responses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterases (CaEs-1-3), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were assessed. The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP. Thus, this set of honeybee biomarkers appears to be a promising tool to evaluate environmental and honeybee health, and it could generate fingerprints to characterize exposures to pesticides.

Separate groups of bees were left for 24 h to feed on 50% sucrose solution containing different concentrations of the tested insecticides, and the lethal concentration that caused 50% mortality (LC50) was estimated. The inhibitory effects on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities as biochemical indicators were determined in vivo after 24 h in head, thorax, and abdomen of surviving bees obtained after treatments with a view to explore the possible mode of action of these compounds. Results indicated that exposure to spinosad showed toxicity to honey bees with LC50 value of 7.34 mg L-1, followed by oxymatrine (LC50 = 10.68 mg L -1), while chlorfluazuron was the least acutely toxic of the tested compounds (LC50 = 2,526 mg L-1). Oxymatrine and spinosad at the same tested concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg L-1) significantly inhibited AChE activity in different organs of honey bee workers, and high inhibition percentage was obtained with the enzyme isolated from the thorax. However, chlorfluazuron at 400, 1,000, 2,000, and 4,000 mg L -1 caused high inhibition of AChE activity isolated from the head (39.65% and 44.22% at 2,000 and 4,000 mg L-1, respectively). In addition, the toxic effects of the tested compounds on activity of ATPase indicated that spinosad caused the highest inhibitory effect in different organs compared with oxymatrine at the same concentrations, and high inhibition was found with ATPase isolated from the head.

In the last years, several studies have reported severe secondary effects on various bee species, including exotic and native bees. In this study, lethal (mortality) and sublethal (locomotor activity) effects of insecticides and acaricides used in strawberries in Brazil (abamectin, novaluron, spinetoram, and thiamethoxam) were evaluated on the native stingless beesMelipona quadrifasciataandTetragonisca fiebrigi. The results showed that the effects varied significantly according to the pesticide, type of exposure (oral or topical), and bee species. Through oral exposure,M. quadrifasciatawas more susceptible to all insecticides except for abamectin, while in topical exposure,T. fiebrigiwas more sensitive. Thiamethoxam followed by spinetoram and abamectin were the most lethal, regardless of species or exposure route; novaluron was not harmful at the highest tested dose. The locomotor activity of bees was altered in the presence of sublethal doses (LC(10)and LC50) of all insecticides. Spinetoram and abamectin can be as much as toxic as thiamethoxam againstM. quadrifasciataandT. fiebrigiin laboratory experiments.

Experimental and molecular modeling approaches,"['Ali, H.M.', 'Abdel-Aty, B.', 'El-Sayed, W.', 'Mariy, F.M.', 'Hegazy, G.M.', 'Mohamed, R.A.', 'Zoghly, H.M.']",Chemosphere,"Although the neonicotinoid insecticides have good selectivity towards insects rather than vertebrates, they have severe effects on honeybee production and pollination activities. Therefore, the effects of imidacloprid (IMI), the most used neonicotinoid, on the two main bioreceptors, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (nAChRŒ±1) of honeybees were examined to identify their roles in honeybee toxicity and possible binding sites which assist in selecting and designing neonicotinoids. In vivo, IMI showed a high inhibitory effect on AChE (IC50 5.63 mg/L); however, the effect was much lower in vitro experiment (IC50 719 mg/L). This result induced us to examine the IMI effect on AChE gene expression which revealed that the AChE-2 gene expression was severely affected by IMI explaining the observed high enzyme inhibition. In addition, although toxicity increased by increasing exposure to IMI (LC50 2.9 mg/L after 4h and 0.75 mg/L after 48h), AChE was not elevated (IC50 5.63 and 5.52 mg/L respectively). Besides, Despite resuming most enzyme activity (77% during 2 h and 84.14% after 4 h), a high mortality level was observed with LC50 2.9 mg/L. These results reinforced that the observed high toxicity is a multifactor process. Accordingly, Molecular modeling and docking of IMI into honeybee AChE and nAChRŒ±1were also performed to examine their possible interactions and identify the important binding sites. Results models indicated that the first two binding sites in AChE were found in the esteratic subunit in the active site explaining the observed in vitro inhibition. In nAChRŒ±1, four of the highest five free energy binding sites are located in the large TM3-TM4 loop and one in the extracellular loops. Consequently, the present work revealed that IMI toxicity is attributed to various factors including direct interaction with both AChE and nAChRŒ±1 as well as downregulating AChE-2 gene expression. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141899,356,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189431305&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.141899&partnerID=40&md5=0d59fc4d5808c83501fe2317b4746c96,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'nicotinic receptor', 'Imidacloprids', 'mortality', 'Toxicity', 'gene expression', 'down regulation', 'Honeybee', 'unclassified drug', 'animal tissue', 'in vitro study', 'metabolism', 'LC50', 'Gene expression', 'genetics', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'insect protein', 'nAChR', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'enzyme activity', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'Models, Molecular', 'molecular docking', 'molecular model', 'binding site', 'Insect Proteins', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Genes expression', 'AChE', 'animal model', 'NAChR', 'in vivo study', 'enzyme', 'nervous system', 'Binding energy', 'Alfa subunit', 'Alpha subunit', 'Binding sites', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding-sites', 'enzyme active site', 'Enzyme activity', 'enzyme inhibition', 'Enzyme inhibition', 'experimental toxicity', 'Free energy', 'Molecular modeling', 'nicotinic receptor alpha1', 'Transmembranes']",,,,,1,

Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and >81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (>36, >49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee). The urea metabolite and 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited LD50 values of >99 500 and >121 500ng per bee, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the [3H]imidacloprid binding site in honeybee head membrane preparations is consistent with that anticipated for a nAChR. IC50 values for the displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by several metabolites such as olefine, 5-OH-, 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, urea and 6-CNA were 0.45, 24, 6600, > 100 000, and > 100 000nM, respectively.

We therefore assessed the susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life span, and reproduction. The highest concentration of deltamethrin (17 mg a.i./L) reduced feeding. Workers treated with deltamethrin had shortened life spans and produced fewer males. Flubendiamide (2000 mg a.i./L) and spinetoram (0.8 mg a.i./L) caused no sublethal effects.

Therefore, we conducted a series of 96-h contact toxicity tests with blue orchard mason bees (Osmia lignaria) using three neonicotinoids, two pyrethroids, and two macrocyclic lactones. Neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and clothianidin) were most toxic with LD50 values ranging from 2.88 to 26.35 ng/bee, respectively.

Additionally, three of seven pesticides (43%) resulted in significantly different mass normalized LD50 values for male and female O. lignaria. These results indicate that non-Apis pollinators may be highly susceptible to pesticides originating from beef cattle feed yards, necessitating consideration of more stringent regulatory protections than those based on A. mellifera pesticide sensitivity. ¬© 2020 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111681,208,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096681977&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111681&partnerID=40&md5=ce6552dc57071201233a00da02827cbe,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'pyrethroid pesticide', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (parameter)', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'thiamethoxam', 'acute toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'male', 'Male', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'macrolide', 'Female', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'dose response', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'ecotoxicity', 'physiological response', 'Toxicity Tests, Acute', 'Apis', 'Models, Theoretical', 'theoretical model', 'bifenthrin', 'permethrin', 'sex difference', 'abamectin', 'ivermectin', 'lactone', 'Lactones', 'macrocyclic compound', 'Macrocyclic Compounds', 'calculation', 'Great Plains']",,,,,1,

Tetragonisca angustula and Scaptotrigona xanthotricha are species that have been used since ancient times for beekeeping. Currently these and other species have been exposed to agronomic practices, among which the use of synthetic pesticides used for crop protection stands out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of the insecticides thiamethoxam and fipronil, which are used in agriculture in several countries in the tropical and subtropical belt in order to establish the risk that these products represent to the survival of these two species. The oral and topical LD50 was obtained by Probit analysis. Comparisons with the LD50s of other stingless bees and Apis mellifera were realized. Although further studies are required to calculate the real risk of the two compounds, the results showed an evident susceptibility of both species. We concluded that it is essential to use tools and practices that reduce the risk, and perform toxicological evaluations of new and existing pesticides on stingless bees. ¬© 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia1.

We investigated the susceptibility of Tetragonisca fiebrigi to sublethal concentrations of insecticides fipronil, malathion, and thiamethoxam (administered through contact and ingestion) by determining the LC50 values after 24 hours of exposure and analyzing changes in the activity of esterase isoenzymes and the chromatin in brain cells. The LC50 values showed that all three insecticides were highly toxic through contact and ingestion. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the relative EST-4 (carboxylesterase) activity in T. fiebrigi was partially inhibited by malathion and fipronil ingestion. Moreover, the EST-4 band intensity was increased following high-concentration thiamethoxam (contact) exposure, indicating the increased relative activity of this isoenzyme to detoxify the compound. In the cytochemical analysis of brain cells, the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) points for the control stingless bees and malathion ingestion-exposed and thiamethoxam-exposed (contact and ingestion) stingless bees were in the range of 0.20-0.30 M MgCl2, whereas that for malathion contact-exposed bees was 0.15 M MgCl2, indicating chromatin relaxation and suggesting an increase in gene expression.

However, studies comparing the toxicity of pesticides to different individuals and species are lacking, making it difficult to evaluate their short- and long-term effects on colonies and populations of these insects. In this work, we tested the lethality of compounds from the main pesticide groups on stingless bees of the species Melipona beecheii Bennett, Trigona nigra Provancher, and Nannotrigona perilampoides Cresson. The LD50 (in micrograms per bee) for each pesticide was calculated for callow workers and foragers of the three species as well as for gynes and drones of M. beecheii. The results showed that all species were highly susceptible to the evaluated compounds. Nicotinoid pesticides were the most toxic, followed in descending order by permethrin, diazinon, and methomyl. We found evidence of a relationship between the body weight of the species and their LD50 for permethrin and methomyl (r = 0.91 and 0.90, respectively) but not for diazinon (r = -0.089). An analysis of contingency tables showed that within each species, callow workers had higher mortalities than foragers (P < 0.01). In M. beecheii at similar pesticide dose more males died compared with females [œá(0.01),1 = 10.16]. However, gynes were less resistant than workers [œá(0.01),1 = 8.11].

Bees are effective pollinators in increasing the production of agricultural commodities. The stingless bee Tetragonula laeviceps (Apidae: Meliponini) is widely cultivated and found around plantations. The insecticides used in the toxicity test were imidacloprid 200 g/L, fipronil 50 g/L, lambda-cyhalothrin 25 g/L, profenofos 500 g/L, and chlorantraniliprole 50 g/L followed by a semi-field test using imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides on the cucumber plant. The LC50 value showed that exposure to imidacloprid, fipronil, and profenofos insecticides caused toxic effects on T. laeviceps by contact and orally. Lambda-cyhalothrin was found harmful on contact exposure, in contrast, chlorantraniliprole was harmful through oral. Classification of insecticide toxicity based on LD50 contact for imidacloprid, fipronil, lambda-cyhalothrin, and profenofos were very toxic and needed a risk assessment. However, chlorantraniliprole was classified as moderately toxic and low risk. In semi-field test results, imidacloprid and fipronil insecticides caused a significant decrease in the leave-return and bee-visiting activity on cucumber flowers. These insecticides also produced a low average yield of fruit weight.

Trigona spinipes populations can be negatively impacted by insecticides commonly used for pest control in crops. However, this species has been neglected in toxicological studies. Here we observed the effects of seven insecticides on the survival of bees that had fed directly on insecticide-contaminated food sources or received insecticides via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates. The effects of insecticides on flight behavior were also determined for the compounds considered to be of low toxicity. RESULTS: Imidacloprid, spinosad and malathion were categorized as highly toxic to T. spinipes, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin, methomyl and chlorfenapyr were of medium to low toxicity and interfered with two aspects of flight behavior evaluated here. Chlorantraniliprole was the only insecticide tested here that had no significant effect on T. spinipes survival, although it did interfere with one aspect of flight capacity. A single bee that had ingested malathion, spinosad or imidacloprid, could contaminate three, four and nineteen other bees, respectively via trophallaxis, resulting in the death of the recipients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the ecotoxicology of a range of insecticides that not only negatively affected T. spinipes survival, but also interfered with flight capacity, a very important aspect of pollination behavior. The toxicity of the insecticides was observed following direct ingestion and also via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates, highlighting the possibility of lethal effects of these insecticides spreading throughout the colony, reducing the survival of non-foraging individuals.

Currently, the existence of bee populations is in danger of decreasing. One of the reasons was the inappropriate use of pesticides. The pesticide groups that influence bee behavior and mortality are neonicotinoid and pyrethroid. This study sought to determine the attractiveness and toxic effect of imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and deltamethrin (pyrethroid) insecticides on T. laeviceps. The experiments were conducted on May to July 2022 at Insect Physiology and Toxicology Laboratory, Department of Plant Protection, Faculty of Agriculture, Bogor Agricultural University. The olfactory response of T. laeviceps was carried out using a Y-tube olfactometer with odor sources including imidacloprid (200 ppm), deltamethrin (12.5 ppm), mineral water and honey. Toxicity bioassays of T. laeviceps were carried out by topical, residual, and oral applications at five insecticide concentrations. Bees were more attracted to honey and water than imidacloprid 200 ppm or deltamethrin 12.5 ppm, while the attractiveness between imidacloprid 200 ppm and deltamethrin 12.5 ppm did not show a significant difference. The toxic effect of imidacloprid on T. laeviceps was greater than deltamethrin for the three different bioassays of insecticides. These two active ingredients were classified as highly toxic (LD50 <2 Œºg/bee) based on EPA classification. The implication of these results is the farmer should not spray the insecticide particularly imidacloprid and deltamethrin on their chili plantation during flowering stages. ¬© 2023, International Society for Southeast Asian Agricultural Sciences.

However, the field-realistic toxicity of formulated premix insecticides comprised of multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to O. lignaria has not been assessed. Here, we use a customized spray tower in a laboratory setting to assess adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to four formulated pesticide mixtures: thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin (TLC), imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin (IBC), chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (CLC) and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram (MS) by directly spraying anesthetized bees in Petri dishes. Sepa-rately, adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to formulated imidacloprid (I), beta-cyfluthrin (BC) and their 1:1 binary combination (IBC) was assessed using the same experimental method. Resulting mortality in each study was screened up to 96 h post-treatment to determine acute whole-body contact toxicity. In the first study, TLC and IBC resulted in statistically higher mortality at 24 and 48 h than the two other insecticide combinations tested. The CLC and MS combinations were slower acting and the highest mortality for O. lignaria exposed to these mixtures was recorded at 96 h. We did observe significant differences in toxicity between CLC and MS. In the second study, exposure to the 1:1 binary combination of IBC caused overall significantly higher mortality than exposure to I or BC alone. Both active ingredients alone, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of mortality to the 1:1 binary combination treatment at the 96 h observation reading, indicating increased speed of kill, but not necessarily increased toxicity.

Therefore, we assessed the acute topical toxicity and generated LD50 values for three insecticides: Dimethoate (62.08 ng a.i./bee), permethrin (50.01 ng a.i./bee), and imidacloprid (12.82 ng a.i/bee). The variation in the mass of individual bees had a significant but small effect on these toxicity estimates. Overall, the toxicity of these insecticides to M. rotundata were within the 10- fold safety factor currently used with A. mellifera toxicity estimates from tier I trials to estimate risk to other bee species. Therefore, tier I pesticide risk assessments with solitary bees may not be necessary, and efforts could be directed to developing more realistic, higher-tier pesticide risk assessment trials for solitary bees.  ¬© 2021 Ansell et al.",2021///,2021,10.7717/peerj.10744,9,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101927968&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.10744&partnerID=40&md5=2533b125b854744c7c680fd3d14a966d,Scopus,"['imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'mortality', 'Imidacloprid', 'body mass', 'LD50', 'dose response', 'permethrin', 'dimethoate', 'Dimethoate', 'Megachile rotundata', 'Megachilidae', 'Solitary bees', 'parasitoid', 'dry mass', 'muscle spasm', 'righting reflex', 'Permethrin']",,,,,1,

The economic contribution of the insect‚Äôs pollinators to world agriculture is estimated at billions of dollars. However, non-judicious choice of pesticides and absence of good plant protection practices, represent a real danger to bees. The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of three insecticides commonly used in cotton protection on bees Apis mellifera adansonii in Benin. Materials and Methods: In this context, bees were taken from hives and transported to the laboratory. Active ingredients and different doses used were as followed: Emamectin benzoate, beta-cyfluthrin+imidacloprid and lamdex+chlorpyrifos at doses of: 2150 nanograms per bee, 125 nanograms per bee, 75, 50, 25, 12.5√ó103, 6, 2.5 and 1.25-0.96 ng per bee, depending on the active ingredient. Each treatment included three replications consisting of 25 bees. Bees were anaesthetized with ether before treatment. Each bee received by topical application on the pronotum, 1 ŒºL of the formulation. Results: Observations were made after 2, 10, 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that, even the lowest doses of the pesticides: 0.96, 7.25 and 21.5 ng per b showed mortality higher than 90% to bees, 48 h after application. An insecticide with active ingredients including beta-cyfluthrin (45 g L‚Äì1), which is a pyrethroid and Imidacloprid (100 g L‚Äì1), a neonicotinoid actually forbidden in many European countries showed very high toxicity to honey bees, indicating values of the LD50 varying from 19.9 ng per bee for 10 h exposure to 1.1√ó10‚Äì2 ng per bee for 18 h and 5√ó10‚Äì4 ng per bee for 36 h. Conclusion: Results of the study indicated the urgent need of good plant protection practices in the frame of sustainable agriculture and bee‚Äôs preservation and conservation. Promotion of strategies as part of the dissemination of good agricultural practices in plant protection is a guarantee which should ensure sustainable agriculture and environmental, human and biodiversity protection. These studies showed the urgency of the integrated plant protection in order to promote good agricultural practices for honey bee‚Äôs protection. ¬© 2016 Deo Gracias Zoclanclounon et al.",2016///,2016,10.3923/je.2016.161.169,13,05-Jun,161,169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991730426&doi=10.3923%2fje.2016.161.169&partnerID=40&md5=f44798c0db3a1f50c059a34cf4d7bb24,Scopus,,,,,,1,

Foraging honey bees may be killed when they are directly exposed to foliar sprays, or they may take contaminated pollen back to hives that maybe toxic to other adult bees and larvae. To assess acute toxicity against the honey bee, we used a modified spray tower to simulate field spray conditions to include direct whole-body exposure, inhalation, and continuing tarsal contact and oral licking after a field spray. A total of 42 formulated pesticides, including one herbicide and one fungicide, were assayed for acute spray toxicity to 4-6-d-old workers. Results showed significantly variable toxicities among pesticides, with LC50s ranging from 25 to thousands of mg/liter. Further risk assessment using the field application concentration to LC1 or LC99 ratios revealed the risk potential of the 42 pesticides. Three pesticides killed less than 1% of the worker bees, including the herbicide, a miticide, and a neonicotinoid. Twenty-six insecticides killed more than 99% of the bees, including commonly used organophosphates and neonicotinoids. The remainder of the 13 chemicals killed from 1-99% of the bees at field application rates. This study reveals a realistic acute toxicity of 42 commonly used foliar pesticides.

However, pesticide application is still recognized as one of the main stress factors causing a decline in the global population of bees. In all ERA procedures, the effects of pesticides on the honey bee species Apis mellifera are used as a reference for the effects on all different bee species. To evaluate if tropical native bees are protected by the current risk assessment procedures and to propose improvements to the methods, we assessed the ecological risk of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid posed to native and exotic bee species. The risk was assessed through a low (TIER I) and an intermediate (TIER II) level of analysis. For TIER I the USEPA BeeREX model was used and for TIER II the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach was adopted. For the imidacloprid exposure conditions, four different crops were taken into consideration; bean, passion fruit, sunflower and tomato. The imidacloprid risk on native species was assessed both by extrapolating the effects obtained to Apis species, and by using ecotoxicological data from tests performed with native species. In TIER I, the risks calculated through empirical data showed that more than 50% of the non-Apis species presented risk levels of 28‚Äì180% higher than those obtained with the extrapolation factor used in the Brazilian pesticide regulation. In TIER II, the SSDs showed that most of the native bees are more sensitive to imidacloprid than the Africanized A. mellifera. This is the first study in which an ERA of a pesticide was conducted on tropical bee species. Here we also present some gaps and perspectives for future studies aiming to improve the risk assessment of pesticides in terrestrial environments. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113127,212,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126866576&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2022.113127&partnerID=40&md5=a06459446fbc7f9b2b077adf6aedaa61,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'plant seed', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'pesticide residue', 'nectar', 'Neonicotinoid', 'LD50', 'Pollinators', 'Brazil', 'pesticide application', 'population decline', 'ecotoxicity', 'environmental risk', 'model', 'sunflower', 'native species', 'Native species', 'tomato', 'Risk quotient', 'calculation', 'BeeREX model', 'bean', 'Brazilian bees', 'passion fruit', 'SSD curve']",,,,,1,

In contrast to single applications of plant protection products (PPP), the effects of tank mixtures of two or more PPP on honey bees are not routinely assessed in the risk assessment of plant protection products. However, tank mixes are often common practice by farmers. Mixtures of practically non-toxic substances can lead to synergistic increase of toxic effects on honey bees, observed for the first time in 19921 in combinations of pyrethroids and azole fungicides. 2004 Iwasa et al. already reported that ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides strongly increase the toxicity of neonicotinoids in laboratory for the contact exposure route. Furthermore, in agricultural practice additives, adjuvants and fertilizers may be added to the spray solution. For these additives usually no informations on potential side effects on bees are available when mixed with plant protection products. Therefore, it is considered necessary to investigate possible additive or synergistic impacts and evaluate potentially critical combinations to ensure protection of bees. Here, we investigated the effects on bees of combinations of insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers under controlled laboratory conditions. A spray chamber was used to evaluate effects following contact exposure by typical field application rates.

The bees responded inconsistently; L. paahaumaa were 36 and 194 times more susceptible to oral and topically applied imidacloprid than A. mellifera, but showed comparable sensitivity to dimethoate. Furthermore, the proposed safety factor of ten applied to honey bee endpoints did not cover the interspecific sensitivity difference.

671,JOUR,Inert agricultural spray adjuvants may increase the adverse effects of selected insecticides on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) under laboratory conditions,"['Wernecke, A.', 'Eckert, J.H.', 'Forster, R.', 'Kurlemann, N.', 'Odemer, R.']",Journal of Plant Diseases and Protection,"Currently, more than 360 spray adjuvants are registered in Germany (September 2021). Unlike plant protection products (PPPs), adjuvants are not subjected to regulatory risk assessment. In practice, numerous combinations of PPPs and adjuvants are therefore possible. Thus, tank mixtures containing insecticides that are classified as non-hazardous to bees up to the highest approved application rate or concentration may raise pollinator safety concerns when mixed with efficacy increasing adjuvants and applied in bee-attractive crops. This study analyzes whether selected ‚ÄúPPP‚Äìadjuvant‚Äù combinations result in increased contact mortality and pose an elevated risk to honey bees. To answer this question, we chose six common spray adjuvants of different classes for laboratory screening. These were then tested in a total of 30 tank mixtures, each with a neonicotinoid (acetamiprid), pyrethroid (lambda-cyhalothrin), diamide (chlorantraniliprole), carbamate (pirimicarb), and butenolide (flupyradifurone) formulation. We adapted an acute contact test (OECD Test Guideline 214) to our needs, e.g., by using a professional spray chamber for more realistic exposures. Our results showed that, in total, 50% of all combinations significantly increased the mortality of caged honey bees in comparison with individual application of insecticides. In contrast, none of the adjuvants alone affected bee mortality (Cox proportional hazard model, p > 0.05). With four of the five insecticide formulations, the organosilicone surfactant Break-Thru¬Æ S 301 significantly increased bee mortality within 72¬†h (for all insecticides except chlorantraniliprole). Furthermore, acetamiprid yielded the highest and second highest mortality increases from a tank mixture with the crop oil surfactant LI 700¬Æ (hazard ratio = 28.84, p < 0.05) and the organosilicone Break-Thru¬Æ S 301 (hazard ratio = 14.66, p < 0.05), respectively.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Japanese orchard bees, Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). The pesticides were acetamiprid (Assail 30SG), Œª-cyhalothrin (Warrior II), dimethoate (Dimethoate 4EC), phosmet (Imidan 70W), and imidacloprid (Provado 1.6F). At least 5 doses of each chemical, diluted in distilled water, were applied to freshly-eclosed adult bees. Mortality was assessed after 48 hr. Dose-mortality regressions were analyzed by probit analysis to test the hypotheses of parallelism and equality by likelihood ratio tests. For A. mellifera, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was imidacloprid, Œª-cyhalothrin, dimethoate, phosmet, and acetamiprid. For O. cornifrons, the decreasing order of toxicity at LD50 was dimethoate, Œª-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and phosmet. Interaction of imidacloprid or acetamiprid with the fungicide fenbuconazole (Indar 2F) was also tested in a 1:1 proportion for each species. Estimates of response parameters for each mixture component applied to each species were compared with dose-response data for each mixture in statistical tests of the hypothesis of independent joint action. For each mixture, the interaction of fenbuconazole (a material non-toxic to both species) was significant and positive along the entire line for the pesticide. Our results clearly show that responses of A. mellifera cannot be extrapolated to responses of O.cornifrons, and that synergism of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides occurs using formulated product in mixtures as they are commonly applied in apple orchards. ¬© 2013 Biddinger et al.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0072587,8,9,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84883618794&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0072587&partnerID=40&md5=54dc2effda0f2c31c1bc794cf1df754c,Scopus,,,,,,1,

Most binary mixtures of CLO with other pesticides exerted additive and antagonistic effects. However, all the ternary mixtures containing CLO and TET (except for CLO+TET+THD) elicited synergistic responses to bees.

For honey bees subjected to pesticide spray, toxicity is assessed by thorax contact to account for all possible contact exposures. In the present study, the authors tested 6 active substances with different hydrophobicity. For the first time, the authors demonstrated that it is possible to induce mortality by pesticide contact with only the wings of the honey bee. The toxicities induced by contact with the wings and thorax were similar, with the wing median lethal dose (LD50) being 0.99 to 2.23 times higher than that of the thorax. This finding demonstrates that the wings represent a relevant route of exposure in the honey bee. In a second approach, the authors estimated the air volume displaced by the wings during 1 beating cycle to be 0.51¬±0.03cm3, which corresponds to a volume of 116.8¬±5.8cm3s-1 at a wing beat frequency of 230 Hz. The authors then tested realistic scenarios of exposure for bees flying through a pesticide cloud at different concentrations. In the worst-case scenario, the dose accumulated during the flight reached 525ngbee-1s-1.

Acute dermal toxicity tests by applying thiamethoxam solution (pL) dissolved in acetone on the dorsal side of thoracic region revealed median lethal dose (dermal; 24 h) as 93.97 ng g-1 against A. mellifera where as, for A. c. cerana, it was 86.51 ng g-1 with corresponding log likelihood ratio as 1.40 showing that both the values were at par with each other. In oral toxicity studies, starved honey bee foragers were fed with various concentrations of thiamethoxam in 50% sucrose water solution. Median lethal toxicity values at 24 h against A. mellifera and A. c. cerana were 67.61 and 31.43 ng g-1, respectively. The log likelihood value of 2.78 showed there exists a significant difference among the two values i.e. A. c. cerana was more susceptible (Sensitivity ratio = 2.51) to thiamethoxam than A. mellifera.

584,JOUR,A new method to assess the acute toxicity toward honeybees of the abrasion particles generated from seeds coated with insecticides,"['Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Girolami, V', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background Large amounts of insecticide-containing dusts produced from abrasion of the seed dressing can be released into the atmosphere during sowing operations. Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1990s for several crops, are the leading products for seed-coating treatments in many countries. Neonicotinoid containing dusts can be effectively intercepted by bees in flight over the sowing field, inducing lethal acute effects, so that restrictions in the use of the main neonicotinoids have been adopted in the European Union. This led to the consequent introduction of replacement insecticides for seed-coating, i.e. methiocarb and thiacloprid, despite the lack of information on both the toxicity and the exposure scenarios for honeybees. Results In this study, a laboratory apparatus was developed in order to quantify the toxicity of the dusts produced from the abrasion of the seed coating. This quantification is based on (i) an airstream transporting coating particles into an exposure chamber; (ii) exposure of bees to reproducible and measurable concentrations of insecticide, and (iii) direct measurement of the exposure dose on single bees. The method allowed us to perform in vivo experiments of honeybee exposure to provide toxicity data in more realistic exposure conditions. In fact, the formulation rather than the active principle alone can be tested, and the exposure is through dusts rather than a solution so that specific absorption behavior can be studied in representative environmental conditions. The method was used to quantify the acute toxicity (LD50) of dusts obtained from the abrasion of corn seeds coated with clothianidin, thiacloprid and methiocarb. Conclusions Our results show that, surprisingly, the replacement insecticide methiocarb has a toxicity (LD50 = 421-693 ng/bee) in the same order of magnitude as clothianidin (LD50 = 113-451 ng/bee) through this specific exposure route, while thiacloprid (LD50 = 16.9 center dot 10(3) ng/bee) has a significantly lower acute toxicity. Moreover, dusts containing methiocarb and clothianidin show a significant increase in toxicity when, after exposure, bees are kept under high humidity conditions. This suggests that the method here presented can be used to obtain complementary toxicity data in the risk assessment procedure for the authorization of new seed-coating insecticides or new formulations.",2020/07/06/,2020,10.1186/s12302-020-00372-z,32,1,,,,,"['ecotoxicology', 'Neonicotinoids', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'clothianidin', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'pesticide residue', 'thiacloprid', 'Acute toxicity', 'coating', 'maize', 'seed', 'sowing', 'Zea mays', 'toxicity test', 'Honeybees', 'Seed coating', 'abrasion', 'Abrasion dusts', 'Exposure measurement', 'Methiocarb', 'Pollinator insects', 'Systemic insecticides']",2190-4707,WOS:000545648100001,,,1,

Demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicides can potentiate insecticides by impairing the production of detoxification enzymes. As both DMI fungicides and insecticides can be used near or during crop bloom, the combination may be hazardous if exposed to pollinators. Using pesticides used in blueberry or apple production, we conducted laboratory bioassays to test how combinations of field-relevant concentrations of DMI fungicides and insecticides affected honey bee (Apis mellifera) survival. We found propiconazole, a DMI fungicide, potentiated the toxicity of the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid.

We also found that the DMI fungicide flusilazole potentiated spinetoram but not acetamiprid. A fungicidal formulation combining pyraclostrobin and boscalid did not potentiate either insecticide.

607,JOUR,Mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid and cyproconazole on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Lv, L.', 'Li, W.', 'Li, X.', 'Wang, D.', 'Weng, H.', 'Zhu, Y.-C.', 'Wang, Y.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Pesticide exposure remains one of the main factors in the population decline of insect pollinators. It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L‚àí1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L‚àí1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees. Our study also provides important guidance for the rational application of pesticide mixtures to protect pollinators in agricultural production effectively. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161700,870,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147246760&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.161700&partnerID=40&md5=9ac6a44f6016d8544a9e03a7c7b2a5c4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'adult', 'Honey bee', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicology', 'gene expression', 'male', 'thiacloprid', 'apoptosis', 'down regulation', 'Thiacloprid', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'fungicide', 'LC50', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'upregulation', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'Agriculture', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'synergism', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'biological marker', 'enzyme activity', 'occupational exposure', 'Population statistics', 'biomarker', 'physiological stress', 'innate immunity', 'Toxic effect', 'cyproconazole', 'Chemical contamination', 'homeostasis', 'signal transduction', 'Enzymes', 'working memory', 'cytochrome', 'enzyme', 'egg laying', 'Biomarker', 'theoretical study', 'Industrial poisons', 'Bee toxicology', 'Cyproconazole', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'lung function', 'Mixture effect', 'Mixture effects', 'Synergetic toxicity', 'Synergetics', 'toxicity assay']",,,,,1,

In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of botanical extracts with homemade preparations used in agroecological crops and their constituents on the bees Apis mellifera and Partamona helleri. Toxicity bioassays of adult bees were done by means of oral exposure and ingestion, using the insecticide imidacloprid as a positive control. Dietary consumption, respiration rate and bee flight were evaluated as sublethal parameters. Although some extracts were toxic to bees, survival was always higher compared to the results obtained with the imidacloprid, which was lethal to 100% of bees. In dietary consumption, P. helleri consumed less (5 mg/bee) in 3 h than A. mellifera (11 mg/bee), and P. helleri consumed less (7 mg/bee) in 24 h than A. mellifera (22 mg/bee). There was no difference in consumption of food containing plant extracts or food containing water only. We did not detect any adverse effects of the botanical extracts on bee respiration rates or flight. The major constituent of N. tabacum is nicotine (8.4‚Äì15.1%), in A. americana it is Œ≤-caryophyllene (11.3%), and in A. colubrina, lupeol (12.2%).

816,JOUR,Concentration- and time-dependent toxicity of commonly encountered pesticides and pesticide mixtures to honeybees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Bommuraj, V', 'Chen, Y', 'Birenboim, M', 'Barel, S', 'Shimshoni, JA']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Honeybees are exposed to a wide range of pesticides for long periods via contaminated water, pollen and nectar. Some of those pesticides might constitute health hazards in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Time-dependent toxicity profiles for many applied pesticides are lacking, despite the fact that such profiles are crucial for toxicological evaluations. Therefore, we sought to determine the time-dependent toxicities of pesticides/pesticide metabolites frequently found in Israeli beehives, namely, amitraz metabolites, N'-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-N-methylformamidine (DMPF) and N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-formamide (DMF), coumaphos, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, acetamiprid and dimethoate (toxic reference). By applying accepted methodological approaches such as the modified Haber's rule (product of concentration and exposure duration leads to a constant effect) and comparisons between cumulative doses at different time points, we determined the time-dependent toxicities of these pesticides. We also studied the mixture toxicities of frequently occurring pesticide combinations and estimated their potential contributions to the overall toxicities of neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid was the only pesticide that complied with Haber's rule. DMPF, dimethoate and imidacloprid exhibited time-diminished-toxicities. In contrast, DMF and acetamiprid exhibited time-reinforced toxicities. Neither the binary mixtures nor the tertiary mixtures of DMF, DMPF and coumaphos at 10 times their environmentally relevant concentrations potentiated the neonicotinoids' toxicities. DMPF and imidacloprid were found to present the greatest hazard to honeybees, based on their 50% lethal cumulative dose and 50% lethal time. Amitraz's instability, its low detection frequency and high toxicity profile of its metabolite, DMPF, lead us to the conclusion that DMPF constitutes the actual toxic entity responsible for amitraz's toxic effect.

Although research has demonstrated synergistic effects of some sterol biosynthesis inhibiting (SBI) fungicides on the toxicity of certain insecticides to bees, a high degree of variability exists in the relatively few SBI fungicide-insecticide interactions tested. Furthermore, most research has been conducted on honey bees, Apis mellifera, limiting our understanding of pesticide synergisms in native wild bees. We tested the effects of the SBI fungicides difenoconazole, myclobutanil, and fenhexamid on acute contact toxicity of the insecticides thiamethoxam (neonicotinoid) and bifenthrin (pyrethroid) to the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens. Based on range-finding trials, we selected a single dosage of each pesticide, with insecticides approximating LD20 values and fungicides approximating their maximum sublethal levels. We found that the triazole SBI fungicide difenoconazole interacted synergistically with bifenthrin, with a maximum synergy ratio of 1.48, while the triazole myclobutanil interacted synergistically with both bifenthrin and thiamethoxam, with maximum synergy ratios of 11.0 and 2.38, respectively. However, the hydroxyanilide SBI fungicide fenhexamid did not exhibit a synergistic effect on either insecticide. Our results suggest that certain SBI fungicides, and potentially those from particular SBI classes, may be particularly harmful to bumble bee health when co-exposure to insecticides occurs, despite their low toxicity when experienced in isolation. ¬© 2019, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2019///,2019,10.1007/s13592-019-00681-0,50,5,733,744,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071485946&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-019-00681-0&partnerID=40&md5=6f50a62cd9153a403518b9bb190c6a35,Scopus,,,,,,1,

Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony. Our data suggest that the microcolony study is only appropriate to assess brood effects to bumble bees for substances with low toxicity to adults, as demonstrated with diflubenzuron.

815,JOUR,Synergistic toxicity and physiological impact of thiamethoxam alone or in binary mixtures with three commonly used insecticides on honeybee,"['Wang, Y.', 'Zhang, W.', 'Shi, T.', 'Xu, S.', 'Lu, B.', 'Qin, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Apidologie,"As one of the most widely used insecticides, thiamethoxam (Th) plays an important role in agriculture pest control but is hazardous to the health of honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica). In agricultural practice, several types of insecticides are often applied simultaneously, but their synergistic effects on honeybees remain elusive. Here, we treated honeybees with various binary mixtures of insecticides in which a sublethal dose of Th was mixed with three other common insecticides: Œª-cyhalothrin (Œª-cy), Œ≤-cypermethrin (Œ≤-cy), and abamectin (Ab). The mortality rates of the groups treated with the insecticide mixtures were higher than that obtained with the pesticides alone. Specifically, the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab combinations exerted a synergistic effect (P < 0.05) on bees and resulted in significantly higher mortality than that obtained with the single treatments. However, the Th + Œ≤-cy mixture had no synergistic effect (P > 0.05) on bees, and the mortality rate of this group was almost identical to those of the groups administered these pesticides alone. Furthermore, the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab mixtures significantly suppressed the activity and expression of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), which are key detoxification enzymes in insects. This result suggests that the Th + Œª-cy and Th + Ab combinations at a given concentration adversely affect the survival of honeybees.

19,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Environmental Entomology,"Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

Mortality was tested in another experiment using exposure at the same concentrations with two differing soil moisture levels (20% and 40%). Nesting activity was reduced by 42% for females exposed at 390 ppb and by 66% for females exposed at 780 ppb. Females treated at 780 ppb produced 40% fewer nest cells per day. Sex ratios of F1 generation were skewed toward male in the 50 ppb treatment group with 50% fewer females. The number of cells and pre-pupae per nest, as well as the weight of pre-pupal cocoons did not vary among exposure levels. There were no mortality effects at 20% soil moisture for any level of imidacloprid, but at 40%, mortality of females was >50% at all levels of imidacloprid.

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L.

Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10Œºgl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent.

If two species are similarly sensitive to a toxin their dose-response relationships will be similar. We propose a method to facilitate comparison between dose-response relationships, namely the response-response relationship, which can be applied to any biomarkers whose responses to the same pollutant are measured across a similar range of doses. We apply the method to bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) and honey bees (Apis mellifera) exposed to a dietary pesticide, imidacloprid, and we investigate both lethal and sublethal biomarkers. Results: We found cross-species similarity in dose-dependent responses, but only in certain sublethal biomarkers. In honey bees, sublethal biomarkers were more sensitive than mortality. In bumble bees, fecundity was the most sensitive biomarker. Conclusion: Our results provisionally suggest the existence of cross-species generalities. The greater sensitivity of sublethal biomarkers than mortality suggests that testing protocols which are overly focussed on mortality may underestimate the ecological impacts of toxic pollutants.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.010,437,,55,60,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200005,,,1,

While the causes of these losses are numerous and the interaction between them is very complex, the role of insecticides has garnered much attention. As a result, there is a need to better understand the risk of insecticides to bees, leading to more studies on both toxicity and exposure. While much research has been conducted on insecticides and bees, there have been very limited studies to elucidate the role that bee genotype and age has on the toxicity of these insecticides. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in insecticide sensitivity between honey bees of different genetic backgrounds (Carniolan, Italian, and Russian stocks) and assess if insecticide sensitivity varies with age. We found that Italian bees were the most sensitive of these stocks to insecticides, but variation was largely dependent on the class of insecticide tested. There were almost no differences in organophosphate bioassays between honey bee stocks (<1-fold), moderate differences in pyrethroid bioassays (1.5 to 3-fold), and dramatic differences in neonicotinoid bioassays (3.4 to 33.3-fold). Synergism bioassays with piperonyl butoxide, amitraz, and coumaphos showed increased phenothrin sensitivity in all stocks and also demonstrated further physiological differences between stocks. In addition, as bees aged, the sensitivity to phenothrin significantly decreased, but the sensitivity to naled significantly increased.

These treatments overlapped the residue levels found in pollen and nectar of many crops and landscape plants, which have higher residue levels than seed-treated crops (less than 10 ppb, corn, canola and sunflower). At 6 weeks, queen mortality was significantly higher in 50 ppb and 100 ppb and by 11 weeks in 20 ppb-100 ppb neonicotinyl-treated colonies. The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37% I, 56% C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears that only a few workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest. The majority of the workers sat immobilized for weeks on the floor of the flight box without moving to fed at sugar syrup feeders. Neonicotinyl residues were lower in wax pots in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided. At 10 (14) ppb I and 50 (39) ppb C, fewer males were produced by the workers, but queens continued to invest in queen production which was similar among treatments. Feeding on imidacloprid and clothianidin can cause changes in behavior (reduced worker movement, consumption, wax pot production, and nectar storage) that result in detrimental effects on colonies (queen survival and colony weight).

One recurring concern is that the current frameworks may be biased towards assessing risks to the honey bee. This paradigm requires extrapolating toxicity information across bee species. Most research effort has therefore focused on quantifying differences in sensitivity across species. However, our understanding of how responses to pesticides may vary within a species is still very poor. Here we take the first steps towards filling this knowledge gap by comparing acute, lethal hazards in sexes and castes of the eusocial bee Bombus terrestris and in sexes of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis after oral and contact exposure to the pesticides sulfoxaflor, Amistar (azoxystrobin) and glyphosate. We show that sensitivity towards pesticides varies significantly both within and across species. Bee weight was a meaningful predictor of pesticide susceptibility. However, weight could not fully explain the observed differences, which suggests the existence of unexplored mechanisms regulating pesticide sensitivity across bee sexes and castes.

Agrochemical concentrations in PM to which pollinators were exposed were based on concentrations observed in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM including a ‚Äúmean‚Äù treatment and a ‚Äúmax‚Äù treatment reflective of reported mean and maximum PM-bound agrochemical concentrations, respectively. In general, pollinators in the mean and max treatments experienced significantly higher mortality compared with controls. Honeybees were most sensitive to pyrethroids, mason bees were most sensitive to neonicotinoids, and painted lady butterfly larvae were most sensitive to macrocyclic lactones. Overall, pollinator mortality was quite low relative to established toxic effect levels derived from traditional pollinator contact toxicity tests. Furthermore, pollinator mortality resulting from exposure to individual agrochemicals via PM was less than that reported to occur at beef cattle feedyards, highlighting the importance of mixture toxicity to native and managed pollinator survival and conservation.

750,JOUR,A novel laboratory method for simulating pollinator exposure to agrochemical-laden particulate matter,"['Green, F.B.', 'Peterson, E.M.', 'Smith, P.N.']",Ecotoxicology,"Environmental transport and deposition of particulate matter (PM) associated with toxic chemicals has begun to receive attention as a source of risk to pollinators. For example, dust arising from manipulations of insecticide-treated seed has potential to exert toxic effects among non-target insects. Similarly, synthetic steroid growth promoters, antibiotics and multiple insecticides and parasiticides detected in fugitive beef cattle feedyard PM may also negatively impact pollinators since many of these chemicals have been detected on wildflowers and pollinators collected near beef cattle feedyards. Therefore, there is a need to assess risk to pollinators posed by deposition of agrochemical-laden PM, both in the field and the laboratory. Unfortunately, established laboratory methods for simulating PM exposure or toxicity associated with contaminated PM are few and highly situation-specific. Herein we describe development and use of a PM circulation system that can be employed to evaluate toxicity of agrochemical-contaminated PM in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Two model organisms (honeybees (Apis mellifera) and mason bees (Osmia lignaria)) were exposed to agrochemical-free PM in the circulator system, and post-exposure mortality was compared with controls. No significant differences in mortality between exposed and control bees were observed. Next, honeybees and mason bees were exposed to PM spiked with an insecticide known to exert toxic effects to pollinators (thiamethoxam). Bees experienced significantly higher mortality when exposed to thiamethoxam-laden PM at environmentally relevant concentrations as compared to bees exposed to agrochemical-free PM. These results confirm the validity of these methods for use in controlled laboratory PM toxicity tests and offer a source of positive and negative control groups for laboratory and field experiments examining exposure of pollinators to potentially toxic agrochemical-laden PM. This method facilitates generation of more realistic toxicity data than standard contact toxicity tests when pollinator exposure scenarios involve particulate-based agrochemicals or other toxic chemicals. ¬© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02660-9,32,4,544,551,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85159114441&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-023-02660-9&partnerID=40&md5=52816e6741feb52e552357e5ad7304f9,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'thiamethoxam', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'Thiamethoxam', 'toxicity testing', 'male', 'agrochemical', 'Pollinators', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'mortality rate', 'Insecta', 'particulate matter', 'Particulate Matter', 'toxicity test', 'Mason bees', 'bovine', 'Cattle', 'Honeybees', 'Particulate matter', 'insect', 'health impact assessment', 'toxic material', 'Toxicity testing methods']",,,,,1,unspecified mortality

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2‚Äì5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health. N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid insecticides are much less toxic to honeybees and bumble bees than N-nitroguanidine compounds. Manjon et al. show that this results from differences in their efficiency of metabolism by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, demonstrating their role as key determinants of bee sensitivity to this insecticide class. ¬© 2018 The Author(s)",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.045,28,7,1137,1.14E+08,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044610718&doi=10.1016%2fj.cub.2018.02.045&partnerID=40&md5=658fa8eb09e437446fa21b5f090a43ed,Scopus,,,,,,1,unspecified sensitivity

Data were used to parameterise a dynamic energy budget model (DEBtox) to further examine potential survival effects up to 30 day and 90 day summer and winter worker lifespans. Honeybees were most sensitive to insecticides (clothianidin > dimethoate >> tau-fluvalinate), then trace metals/metalloids (cadmium, arsenic), followed by the fungicide propiconazole and herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). LC(50)s calculated from DEBtox parameters indicated a 27 fold change comparing exposure from 48 to 720 hours (summer worker lifespan) for cadmium, as the most time-dependent chemical as driven by slow toxicokinetics. Clothianidin and dimethoate exhibited more rapid toxicokinetics with 48 to 720 hour LC50s changes of <4 fold.

For example, recent work has shown that cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides, including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this, exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration. Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators. ¬© 2019 Beadle et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2019///,2019,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007903,15,2,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061562980&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1007903&partnerID=40&md5=2e2bbb319513299a2211bd88ed4c830a,Scopus,,,,,,1,acute toxicity unspecified
779,JOUR,Influence of varroa mite (Varroa destructor) management practices on insecticide sensitivity in the honey bee (Apis mellifera),"['Rinkevich, F.D.', 'Danka, R.G.', 'Healy, K.B.']",Insects,"Since Varroa mites may cause devastating losses of honey bees through direct feeding, transmitting diseases, and increasing pathogen susceptibility, chemical and mechanical practices commonly are used to reduce mite infestation. While miticide applications are typically the most consistent and efficacious Varroa mite management method, miticide-induced insecticide synergism in honey bees, and the evolution of resistance in Varroa mites are reasonable concerns. We treated colonies with the miticide amitraz (Apivar¬Æ), used IPM practices, or left some colonies untreated, and then measured the effect of different levels of mite infestations on the sensitivity of bees to phenothrin, amitraz, and clothianidin. Sensitivity to all insecticides varied throughout the year among and within treatment groups. Clothianidin sensitivity decreased with increasing mite levels, but no such correlation was seen with phenothrin or amitraz. These results show that insecticide sensitivity is dynamic throughout the 5 months test. In-hive amitraz treatment according to the labeled use did not synergize sensitivity to the pesticides tested and this should alleviate concern over potential synergistic effects. Since IPM practices were largely ineffective at reducing Varroa mite infestation, reliance on chemical methods of Varroa mite management is likely to continue. However, miticides must be used judiciously so the long term effectiveness of these compounds can be maximized. These data demonstrate the complex and dynamic variables that contribute to honey bee colony health. The results underscore the importance of controlling for as many of these variables as possible in order to accurately determine the effects of each of these factors as they act alone or in concert with others. ¬© 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2017///,2017,10.3390/insects8010009,8,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85009726572&doi=10.3390%2finsects8010009&partnerID=40&md5=b790e3c5ad271f79807654c464e2e0e2,Scopus,,,,,,1,unspecified sensitivity

They may also encounter mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus fungi infesting pollen in beebread. Moreover, bees are exposed to agricultural pesticides, particularly in-hive acaricides used against the parasite Varroa destructor. They cope with these and other xenobiotics primarily through enzymatic detoxificative processes, but the regulation of detoxificative enzymes in honey bees remains largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used several approaches to ascertain effects of dietary toxins on bee susceptibility to synthetic and natural xenobiotics, including the acaricide tau-fluvalinate, the agricultural pesticide imidacloprid, and the naturally occurring mycotoxin aflatoxin. We administered potential inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes, the principal biochemical system for Phase 1 detoxification in insects, to investigate how detoxification is regulated. The drug phenobarbital induces P450s in many insects, yet feeding bees with phenobarbital had no effect on the toxicity of taufluvalinate, a pesticide known to be detoxified by bee P450s. Similarly, no P450 induction, as measured by tau-fluvalinate tolerance, occurred in bees fed xanthotoxin, salicylic acid, or indole-3-carbinol, all of which induce P450s in other insects. Only quercetin, a common pollen and honey constituent, reduced tau-fluvalinate toxicity. In microarray comparisons no change in detoxificative gene expression was detected in phenobarbital-treated bees. However, northern blot analyses of guts of bees fed extracts of honey, pollen and propolis showed elevated expression of three CYP6AS P450 genes. Diet did not influence tau-fluvalinate or imidacloprid toxicity in bioassays; however, aflatoxin toxicity was higher in bees consuming sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup than in bees consuming honey. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest that regulation of honey bee P450s is tuned to chemicals occurring naturally in the hive environment and that, in terms of toxicological capacity, a diet of sugar is not equivalent to a diet of honey.",2012/02/03/,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0031051,7,2,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000302178400026,,,1,unspecified toxicity

When worker bees were exposed to temperatures of 4, 27, 40, 45 and 50. ¬∞C for 1. h, decreased survival occurred only at 50. ¬∞C. Further, increased levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90, but not hsp40, were detected, and reached a maximum at 45. ¬∞C, particularly in the hypopharyngeal glands and fat bodies. Artificial ingestion of two flower-thinning agents containing either 0.1% boron and zinc, or 1% sulfur increased hsp70 and grp78 levels at different rates without affecting hsp40 and hsp90 levels, and had no effect on workers' mortality. However, ingestion of imidacloprid solution (0.5-50. ppm) increased mortality in workers and decreased the levels of hsp70, grp78, and hsp90 in a dose-dependent manner. Our results showed that the responses of honey bees to each hsp are differential and highly specific to different stresses.

We found that drones (haploid males) were more sensitive to cold and imidacloprid exposure than workers (sterile, diploid females), but the cocktail was not toxic at the concentrations tested. We corroborated this lack of cocktail toxicity with in-hive exposures via pollen feeding. We then used quantitative proteomics to investigate protein expression profiles in the hemolymph of topically exposed workers and drones, and found that 34 proteins were differentially expressed in exposed drones relative to controls, but none were differentially expressed in exposed workers.

631,JOUR,Insights into the degradation and toxicity difference mechanism of neonicotinoid pesticides in honeybees by mass spectrometry imaging,"['Zhang, Y', 'Chen, D', 'Du, MY', 'Ma, LL', 'Li, P', 'Qin, R', 'Yang, JR', 'Yin, ZB', 'Wu, XZ', 'Xu, HH']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Honeybees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and flowering plants, whereas they are confronting decline around the world due to the overuse of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids. The mechanism behind the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on honeybees has attracted considerable interest, yet it remains unknown due to the limited insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in honeybees. Herein, we demonstrated the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDIMSI) for the spatiotemporal visualization of neonicotinoids, such as N-nitroguanidine (dinotefuran) and Ncyanoamidine (acetamiprid) compounds, administered by oral application or direct contact, in the whole-body section of honeybees. The MSI results revealed that both dinotefuran and acetamiprid can quickly penetrate various biological barriers and distribute within the whole-body section of honeybees, but acetamiprid can be degraded much faster than dinotefuran. The degradation rate of acetamiprid is significantly decreased when piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is applied, whereas that of dinotefuran remains almost unchanged. These two factors might contribute to the fact that dinotefuran affords a higher toxicity to honeybees than acetamiprid. Moreover, the toxicity and degradation rate of acetamiprid can be affected by co-application with tebuconazole. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the discrepant toxicity between dinotefuran and acetamiprid does not lie in the difference in their of various barriers of but in the degradation rate of neonicotinoid pesticides within honeybee tissues. Moreover, new perspectives are given to better understand the causes of the current decline in honeybee populations posed by insecticides, providing guidelines for the precise use of conventional agrochemicals and the rational design of novel pesticide candidates.

However, studies have reported that anthropogenic actions, such as the use of pesticides, negatively affect bee survival and behavior. We tested the effect of a commercially available pesticide mix containing two pesticide classes, a neonicotinoid and a pyrethroid, on the social behavior of the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata (Lepeletier, 1863).

A major concern in the confection of bee diets is whether specific ingredients, such as GMO grain, or contaminants such as pesticides that are applied to crops, negatively impact bee health. We measured hemolymph protein levels and the lifespan of honey bees fed on diets containing non-hybrid (IAC-Airan), hybrid (AG 7088) or transgenic (AG 8088YG) maize, the seeds of which had been treated with fipronil, imidacloprid or left untreated. Corn from these plantings was harvested, dried and finely ground, and then used for the preparation of corn-based diets. Groups of 100 newly emerged bees were placed in cages, where the diets were offered ad libitum. Honey bee lifespan was similar for all the corn diets, though shorter than for bees fed beebread and longer than for bees fed only honey. Total protein in the hemolymph of bees fed with transgenic maize was 15% lower than in bees fed on non-hybrid maize; lipophorin and vitellogenin, were more reduced, by over 30%. Irrespective of corn variety, imidacloprid resulted in over 25% lower levels of lipophorin compared with the control. Lower storage and transport protein levels would compromise the ability of the bees to rear brood and develop an adequate immune response to pathogen challenge.

Here, the authors combine a systems biology approach and laboratory experiments to show that the immune suppressive effect of the pathogen deformed wing virus can be responsible for the disparity amongst honey bee experiments. While there is widespread concern regarding the impact of pesticides on honey bees, well-replicated field experiments, to date, have failed to provide clear insights on pesticide effects. Here, we adopt a systems biology approach to gain insights into the web of interactions amongst the factors influencing honey bee health. We put the focus on the properties of the system that depend upon its architecture and not on the strength, often unknown, of each single interaction. Then we test in vivo, on caged honey bees, the predictions derived from this modelling analysis. We show that the impact of toxic compounds on honey bee health can be shaped by the concurrent stressors affecting bees. We demonstrate that the immune-suppressive capacity of the widespread pathogen of bees, deformed wing virus, can introduce a critical positive feed-back loop in the system causing bistability, i.e., two stable equilibria. Therefore, honey bees under similar initial conditions can experience different consequences when exposed to the same stressor, including prolonged survival or premature death. The latter can generate an increased vulnerability of the hive to dwindling and collapse.

We studied the effects of T. mercedesae and imidacloprid on the survival, food consumption and midgut bacterial diversity of Apis mellifera in the laboratory. Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine the bacterial composition in the honey bee midgut.

However, exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids represents a major problem for bee health, necessitating strategies that can improve agricultural sustainability and pollinator health. Here we report a simple and scalable solution, through ingestible hydrogel microparticles (IHMs), which can capture neonicotinoids in vitro and in the bee gastrointestinal tract to mitigate the harmful effects of pesticides. Using the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) as a model species and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, we demonstrated by means of lethal and sublethal assays the substantial benefits of IHM treatments. Under lethal exposure of imidacloprid, bumblebees that received IHM treatment exhibited a 30% increase in survival relative to groups without IHM treatment. After a sublethal exposure of 5 ng, IHM treatment resulted in improved feeding motivation and a 44% increase in the number of bees that engaged in locomotor activity. Wingbeat frequency was significantly lower after a single 5 or 10 ng imidacloprid dose; however, IHM treatment improved wingbeat frequency. Overall, the IHMs improved bumblebee health, and with further optimization have the potential to benefit apiculture and reduce risk during crop pollination by managed bees. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1038/s41893-024-01432-5,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203274290&doi=10.1038%2fs41893-024-01432-5&partnerID=40&md5=7e7aef2280c9237440440fa49f42f7e4,Scopus,"['Insecticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Imidacloprids', 'Pesticide effects', 'Pesticides exposures', 'In-vitro', 'Simple++', 'Agricultural economy', 'Agricultural sustainability', 'Crop cultivation', 'Micro particles', 'Scalable solution']",,,,,1,unpsecified lethality

Despite many studies have revealed that honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) larvae are posting a high risk on exposure to pesticides, but the toxicology information of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid on bee larvae remain limited. Results: The no observed adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of chlorothalonil and acetamiprid for honey bee larvae were 4¬†Œºg/mL and 2¬†Œºg/mL, respectively. Except for CarE, the enzymic activities of GST and P450 were not influenced by chlorothalonil at NOAEC, while chronic exposure to acetamiprid slightly increased the activities of the three tested enzymes at NOAEC. Further, the exposed larvae showed significantly higher expression of genes involved in a series of different toxicologically relevant process following, including caste development (Tor (GB44905), InR-2 (GB55425), Hr4 (GB47037), Ac3 (GB11637) and ILP-2 (GB10174)), immune system response (abaecin (GB18323), defensin-1 (GB19392), toll-X4 (GB50418)), and oxidative stress response (P450, GSH, GST, CarE).

Therefore, the sublethal effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on the survival and morphological parameters of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris were investigated in the present study. Cells from both non-target organs (Malpighian tubules and midgut) and target organs (brain) were analyzed for morphological alterations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The findings showed that when M. scutellaris foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100 = 0.000543 ng a. i./ŒºL), longevity was not reduced but brain function was affected, even with the non-target organs attempting to detoxify. The cellular damage in all the organs was mostly reflected in irregular nuclei shape and condensed chromatin, indicating cell death. The most frequent impairments in the Malpighian tubules were loss of microvilli, disorganization of the basal labyrinth, and cytoplasmic loss. These characteristics are related to an attempt by the cells to increase the excretion process, probably because of the high number of toxic molecules that reach the Malpighian tubules and need to be secreted. In general, damages that compromise the absorption of nutrients, excretion, memory, and learning processes, which are essential for the survival of M. scutellaris, were found.

In social insects, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of reproductives, i.e. males and queens, and efficient collaborative brood care by workers. Therefore, interactive effects between malnutrition and environmental pollution on sperm and feeding glands (hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs)) would provide mechanisms for population declines, unless buffered against due to their fitness relevance. However, while negative effects for bumble bee colony fitness are known, the effects of malnutrition and insecticide exposure singly and in combination on individuals are poorly understood. Here we show, in a fully-crossed laboratory experiment, that malnutrition and insecticide exposure result in neutral or antagonistic interactions for spermatozoa and HPGs of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, suggesting strong selection to buffer key colony fitness components. No significant effects were observed for mortality and consumption, but significant negative effects were revealed for spermatozoa traits and HPGs. The combined effects on these parameters were not higher than the individual stressor effects, which indicates an antagonistic interaction between both. Despite the clear potential for additive effects, due to the individual stressors impairing muscle quality and neurological control, simultaneous malnutrition and insecticide exposure surprisingly did not reveal an increased impact compared to individual stressors, probably due to key fitness traits being resilient.

These chemicals can have detrimental effects on bees' physiology, behaviour and reproduction. Floral nectar also contains secondary chemistry with its own effects on bee health. How nectar secondary chemistry may act additively or synergistically with neonicotinoids is unknown. Here, we asked how an acute exposure to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid (IMD) affected the longevity, immune function and behaviour of bumble bee Bombus impatiens workers maintained on diets enriched with one of three nectar secondary metabolites (NSMs; the alkaloid caffeine, the terpenoid thymol or the cardiac glycoside digoxin). A factorial design allowed us to assess the potential for additive and interactive effects of each NSM and IMD combination on multiple health outcomes. Without IMD exposure, different dietary NSMs each had positive effects on life span (caffeine), immune function (digoxin) and activity levels (caffeine, thymol), although these came with trade-offs. A single sublethal IMD exposure overshadowed these NSM effects, and in two cases, an NSM-enriched diet magnified the negative effects of pesticide exposure. In summary, we show that even a single acute exposure to a pesticide has the potential to reshape interactions between pollinators and plants mediated by nectar secondary chemistry.

We found that extensive foragers (A. mellifera) experienced the highest pesticide risk-additive toxicity-weighted concentrations. However, only intermediate (B. terrestris) and limited foragers (O. bicornis) responded to landscape context-experiencing lower pesticide risk with less agricultural land. Pesticide risk correlated among bee species and between food sources and was greatest in A. mellifera-collected pollen-useful information for future postapproval pesticide monitoring. We provide foraging trait- and landscape-dependent information on the occurrence, concentration and identity of pesticides that bees encounter to estimate pesticide risk, which is necessary for more realistic risk assessment and essential information for tracking policy goals to reduce pesticide risk. Analysing pesticide residues in pollen and nectar collected by three bee species along a land-use gradient, the authors show that extensive foragers like Apis mellifera have higher pesticide risk than species that forage at intermediate or limited ranges, irrespective of landscape context.",2023/04//,2023,10.1038/s41559-023-01990-5,7,4,547,+,,,,2397-334X,WOS:000941104400002,,,0,
638,JOUR,Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Young Adult Honeybee Behaviour,"['Go√±alons, C', 'Farina, WM']",PLOS ONE,"Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015/10/21/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000363248400070,,,0,

In laboratory experiments, we tested whether the stingless bee Tetragonula hockingsi avoids insecticide in sucrose solutions and how T. hockingsi responds to insecticide and heat stress combined. We found that T. hockingsi neither preferred nor avoided sucrose solutions with either low (2.5 √ó 10 -4 ng Œºl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 √ó 10 -4 ng Œºl -1 fipronil) or high (2.5 √ó 10 -3 ng Œºl -1 imidacloprid or 1.0 √ó 10 -3 ng Œºl -1 fipronil) insecticide concentrations when offered alongside sucrose without insecticide. In our combined stress experiment, the smallest dose of imidacloprid (7.5 √ó 10 -4 ng) did not significantly affect thermal tolerance (CT max).

Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control, 0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg-1, during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment. At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild (0.2-0.8 mg kg-1) we detected minimal negative effects to bumble bee colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at 8.0 mg kg-1 spinosad, about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a 'worst case' field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg-1 were slower foragers on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad treated colonies. Inclusion of similar sub-lethal assays to detect effects of pesticides on pollinators would aid in development of environmentally responsible pest management strategies. ¬© 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005///,2005,10.1002/ps.1058,61,7,619,626,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-21244438023&doi=10.1002%2fps.1058&partnerID=40&md5=065515d234468618ae230bc31e399229,Scopus,,,,,,0,lethality but assumed irrelevant for LD50

In worst case laboratory studies using glass plates, an intrinsic level of toxicity to predatory mites (Typhlodromus pyri) and parasitic wasps (Aphidius rhopalosiphi) was observed. In laboratory studies with bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) insects either dosed topically or fed sucrose solutions containing spinosad were also adversely affected. When tested in higher tier studies (extended laboratory or semi-field), spinosad was seen to be highly selective to many important beneficial species. Spinosad when used according to good agricultural/horticultural practice, has been shown to be compatible with predatory mites (T.pyri, Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius californicus), predatory heteroptera (Orius insidiosus, O. laevigatus and Macrolophus caliginosus), coccinellidae (Hippodamia convergens and Coccinella septempunctata) and neuroptera (Chrysoperla cornea and C. rufibularis). Parasitic hymenoptera are particularly sensitive to spinosad. However, toxic effects are short lived due to the low persistence of spinosad. This means that species such as A. colemani can be soon introduced to a glasshouse after application (1-2 weeks). Semi-field studies with bumble bees have also been conducted. Spinosad was applied when bees were not flying. Bees were allowed to forage on the treated plants when spray deposits had dried. The findings from these studies indicated that, when used in this way, spinosad was completely safe to foraging worker bees. On inspection of the hives, it was seen that no significantly adverse effects on queen or brood had occurred. It can be concluded that spinosad is highly selective to beneficials and pollinators making it an ideal insect control product for use within glasshouse IPM programmes.",2000///,2000,,65,,393,400,,,,0368-9697,WOS:000169941300045,,,0,

This raises the question of whether data for honey bees are a good proxy for other bee species. This issue is not new and has resulted in several publications in which the sensitivity of bee species is compared based on the values of the 48-h median lethal dose (LD50) from acute test results. When this approach is used, observed differences in sensitivity may result both from differences in kinetics and from inherent differences in species sensitivity. In addition, the physiology of the bee, like its overall size, the size of the honey stomach (for acute oral tests), and the physical appearance (for acute contact tests) also influences the sensitivity of the bee. The recently introduced Toxicokinetic‚ÄìToxicodynamic (TKTD) model that was developed for the interpretation of honey bee tests (Bee General Uniform Threshold Model for Survival [BeeGUTS]) could integrate the results of acute oral tests, acute contact tests, and chronic tests within one consistent framework. We show that the BeeGUTS model can be calibrated and validated for other bee species and also that the honey bee is among the more sensitive bee species. In addition, we found that differences in sensitivity between species are smaller than previously published comparisons based on 48-h LD50 values. The time-dependency of the LD50 and the specifics of the bee physiology are the main causes of the wider variation found in the published literature.

Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/ŒºL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees.

Due to economi-cal constraints and process efficiency PPP mixtures are commonly used in agricultural practices. However, some-times interactions among agrochemicals lead to undesir-able additive and synergistic effects. Especially mixtures of pyrethroids or neonicotinoids with azole fungicides, which inhibit sterol biosynthesis, have a synergistic potential of negatively affecting honey bees. For such mixtures, regulatory restrictions are already in place. These synergistic effects are associated with azole fungicides inhibiting the main detoxification enzyme P450, which hinders the bee to detoxify the insecticide.

Defining them is thus one of the main challenges of a risk assessment scheme design. In the light of the scientific publications on the subject, the existing risk coefficients and methodologies used for the toxicity evaluation under international guidelines result questionable. Results: LD50 values have shown to be variable. Prolonged effects following single contact can sometimes be observed when measuring the acute toxicity. The trigger value (10) of the risk coefficient results as inadequate. The toxicity derived from the exposure to substances continuously available for bees at sub-lethal doses needs to be evaluated separately, given the wide differences between acute and chronic lethal effects of pesticides. Conclusions: The observation period of the mortality tests should be lengthened as long as mortality increases, and while control mortality remains acceptable. Whenever active substances can pollute bees' food sources, first tier tests should include laboratory tests: (1) on adult bees with: (a) acute toxicity tests; (b) chronic toxicity tests; (c) behavioural tests; and (2) larvae toxicity tests.

Bees displayed no visible tremors or convulsions except for a small sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, and only at 100ppb syrup. Imidacloprid shortened the captive longevities of the solitary bees. Tolerant bee species lived ‚àº10 to 12 days in the bioassays and included two social and one solitary species: Halictus ligatus, Apis mellifera and Ptilothrix bombiformis (rose mallow bees), respectively. No other bee species tolerated imidacloprid as well as honey bees did, which exhibited no appreciable mortality and only modest paralysis across concentration. In contrast, native bees either lived shorter lives, experienced longer paralysis, or endured both. Overall, longevity decreased with concentration linearly for social bees and non-linearly for solitary species. The percentage of a bee's captive lifespan spent paralyzed increased logarithmically with concentration for all species, although bumble bees suffered longest. Of greatest concern was comparable debilitation of agriculturally valuable solitary bees at both low and high sublethal rates of imidacloprid. ¬© 2023 Public Library of Science.

The pollination carried out by the honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is crucial in increasing the productivity of the melon (Cucumis melo L.). The main objective of this study was to assess if insecticides applied in the cultivation of cantaloupe melon exhibit significant levels of toxicity toward A. mellifera. We tested the toxicity of azadirachtin, pyriproxyfen, chlorantraniliprole, and imidacloprid, which are commonly sprayed to manage melon pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), the pickleworm Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll) and the melonworm Diaphania hyalinata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Three treatments were carried out, 0.0x, 0.1x and 1.0x the concentration recommended by the manufacturer for the control of those pests. Repellency tests, analysis of mortality through contact and ingestion, and flight tests were performed. The insecticide imidacloprid caused mortality rates above 90% in all tested exposure pathways, displaying high residue persistence on plants. Although not causing significant mortality in the ingestion test, pyriproxyfen caused significant mortality after exposure through contact, and change in flight ability. Azadirachtin caused mortality in the ingestion test and impaired the flight ability of bees, while chlorantraniliprole only impaired the flight ability. Moreover, bees were not repelled by these insecticides, suggesting that they may collect contaminated food in the field while foraging. Altogether, ecofriendly, alternative pest control options should be developed, as well as the adoption of more selective insecticides, in order to reduce the non-target effects on honeybees and guarantee their pollination services.",2020/01//,2020,10.1007/s10646-019-02145-8,29,1,97,107,,,,0963-9292,WOS:000515814700009,,,0,

Global concerns about declining bee populations due to agrochemical pollutants have, however, been biased towards the honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. Here, we analysed the unintended effects of commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, and a fungicide mixture of thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil on color preference, respiration rates and group locomotory activities of both P. helleri and A. mellifera. Our results revealed that P. helleri foragers that were not exposed to pesticides changed their color preference during the course of a year. By contrast, we found that pesticide exposure altered the color preference of stingless bees in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, imidacloprid decreased the overall locomotion of both bee species, whereas the fungicide mixture increased locomotion of only stingless bees. The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl). Our findings emphasize the importance of P. helleri as a model for Neotropical wild pollinator species in pesticide risk assessments, and also the critical importance of including groups of agrochemicals that are often considered to have minimal impact on pollinators, such as fungicides. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146432,779,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102623983&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.146432&partnerID=40&md5=e5fa57184c7f0df30994ae0bf9927166,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'Crops', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'Imidacloprids', 'Pesticide effects', 'Meliponinae', 'Neotropics', 'stingless bee', 'Honey bee', 'locomotion', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'color', 'Color', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'nontarget organism', 'fungicide', 'Locomotion', 'agriculture', 'behavioral response', 'Behavioral response', 'Behavioral responses', 'breathing rate', 'chlorothalonil', 'Chlorothalonil', 'Color preferences', 'Exposed to', 'Fungicide exposure', 'Fungicides', 'Meliponini, apis mellifera', 'Meliponini, Apis mellifera', 'Mixtures', 'Native plants', 'Partamona helleri', 'preference behavior', 'respiration', 'Respiration rate', 'Respiratory Rate', 'thiophanate methyl']",,,,,0,

Although most neonicotinoids are highly toxic to bees, some of them are relatively safe. To explore the molecular mechanism of these differences in toxicity, homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were applied to study the interactions between Apis mellifera (Œ±8)2(Œ≤1)3 nAChR and high bee-toxic neonicotinoid (imidacloprid, IMI), medium bee-toxic (thiacloprid, THI) and low bee-toxic butenolides (flupyradifurone, FPF).

In recent years, managed honeybee colonies have decreased rapidly. The application of pesticides is hypothesized to be an important route leading to colony loss. Herein, a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was used to determine eight highly detectable pesticides (carbendazim, prochloraz, pyrimethanil, fenpropathrin, chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acetamiprid) in rape flowers. A field experiment was conducted at the recommended dose to evaluate the contact exposure risk posed to honeybees for 0-14 days after treatment. The initial residue deposits of neonicotinoids and fungicides among these compounds were 0.4-1.3 mg/kg and 11.7-32.3 mg/kg, respectively, and 6.4 mg/kg for fenpropathrin and 4.2 mg/kg for chlorpyrifos.

618,JOUR,Are honeybees suitable surrogates for use in pesticide risk assessment for non-Apis bees?,"['Thompson, HM', 'Pamminger, T']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Historically, bee regulatory risk assessment for pesticides has centred on the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), primarily due to its availability and adaptability to laboratory conditions. Recently, there have been efforts to develop a battery of laboratory toxicity tests for a range of non-Apis bee species to directly assess the risk to them. However, it is not clear whether the substantial investment associated with the development and implementation of such routine screening will actually improve the level of protection of non-Apis bees. We argue, using published acute toxicity data from a range of bee species and standard regulatory exposure scenarios, that current first-tier honeybee acute risk assessment schemes utilised by regulatory authorities are protective of other bee species and further tests should be conducted only in cases of concern. We propose similar analysis of alternative exposure scenarios (chronic and developmental) once reliable data for non-Apis bees are available to expand our approach to these scenarios. In addition, we propose that in silico (simulation) approaches can then be used to address population-level effects in more field-realistic scenarios. Such an approach could lead to a protective, but also workable, risk assessment for non-Apis species while contributing to pollination security in agricultural landscapes around the globe.

RESULTS: Bees exposed to imidacloprid displayed a significant dose-dependent reduction in consumption at 10 and 100 Œºg L-1, which was reversed when untreated feed was offered. No consistent avoidance/antifeedant response to nectar substitute with thiamethoxam was detected at the more field-realistic dose rates of 1 and 10 Œºg L-1, and exposure to the very high 100 Œºg L-1 dose rate was followed by 100% mortality of experimental insects.

Guttation fluid may contain neonicotinoid residues after plant uptake from seed treatments. To clarify the relevance of the guttation fluid as a water source for honey bee colonies and to assess potential associated risks under conditions of agronomic practice, various studies were performed in key broad acre crops such as maize, sugar beet, potato (in-furrow application), winter barley and oilseed rape by placing honeybee colonies adjacent to freshly emerged fields for several weeks and by following up potential lethal and sub-lethal effects, as well as potential effects on colony performance. Results: Guttation droplets contained peak residue levels theoretically capable of harming individual honeybees (i.e. several hundred ppm). Residue levels, however, generally decreased with time, as expected based on the physiological process involved. The temporal coincidence of honeybee flight activity and the presence of guttation droplets were generally limited to early morning hours and to a much lesser extent to evening hours. Spatially, honeybees were found to predominately collect water, if any, in the direct vicinity of the hives. Water collection generally ceased within a couple of metres distance to the hives, which renders distance to the crop to be a significant exposure factor, and in turn renders dew and guttation from off-crop vegetation to be more relevant to water collecting honeybees than guttation from the crop. Mortality events, if any, were scarce and generally matched in treatments and in controls. The absolute numbers of dead bees involved in these rare cases were so low that they did not translate into any colony level effects or impacts on bee health or overwintering success, nor on adverse effects on honey production of the involved colonies. Conclusions: Given the overall body of data, the associated intensity of the assessments in each study as well as the worst-case exposure conditions employed, it can be concluded that exposure of honeybee colonies to guttation fluid, excreted from neonicotinoid seed-treated crop plants, did not pose an unacceptable acute or chronic risk to honeybee colony development or survival, and does not adversely interfere with bee keeping practices. Overall, guttation water from seed treated crop plants was found not to be a significant exposure route for honeybees.",2015///,2015,,450,,160,167,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000381782400029,,,0,

The overall weight of evidence indicates that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to IMI from its use as a seed treatment. Exposures via dusts from currently used seed coatings present a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure is via uptake in plants that are a source of pollen or nectar for honeybees. There were few higher-tier observational (ecoepidemiological) studies conducted with IMI. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable, but the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion‚Äìthat IMI had no adverse effects on viability of the honeybee colony.

Phytochemicals, e.g., quercetin, have been demonstrated to increase the pesticide tolerance of Apis mellifera Linnaeus (Hymenoptera: Apidae), which is helpful to develop strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to pollinators. In this study, we hypothesized phytochemicals could reduce the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on Apis cerana Fabricius. The lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana workers were investigated. The results showed that A. cerana workers chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid had a significantly shorter longevity by 10.81 d compared with control. Acute exposure to imidacloprid at 100 Œºg/liter impaired the sucrose responsiveness and memory retention of the workers, and 20 Œºg/liter reduced the sucrose responsiveness. The treatment with 37.8 mg/liter quercetin for 24 h could increase the longevity of A. cerana workers when chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid, and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin feeding treatment alleviated the impairment of sucrose responsiveness. However, workers treated with 151.2 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter quercetin had a significantly shorter longevity compared to that of bees chronically exposed to 100 Œºg/liter imidacloprid without quercetin treatment. Our results suggested that quercetin treatment could produce a biphasic influence on the lethal effects of imidacloprid on A. cerana. Quercetin at 37.8 mg/liter and 75.6 mg/liter in the diet before pesticide exposure was able to reduce the lethal and sublethal effects of imidacloprid, respectively, providing potential strategies to reduce the pesticides hazards to native honey bees (A. cerana).  ¬© 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

741,JOUR,"Time-dependent effects on bumble bees of dietary exposures to farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil)","['Mulvey, J.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Farmland bees encounter insecticides in their diet when visiting the flowers of pesticide-treated crops with residues in nectar and pollen. A sustained exposure to even trace residues could be severely harmful if the ingested substance has a long biological half-life and its toxicity therefore intensifies over time, which is termed time-reinforced toxicity (TRT). Bumble bees are important farmland pollinators, but their susceptibility to TRT from insecticides has not been established previously. This study therefore investigated the potential for three farmland insecticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam and fipronil) to generate TRT in bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) by dietary exposure in the laboratory using lethality as an endpoint under both fixed-dose and pulsed-dose regimes. RESULTS: The insecticides varied in toxic effect. Fipronil exposures produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity (days of exposure survived) and strong TRT with no evidence of clearance-based recovery. Thiamethoxam exposures also produced a dose-dependent reduction in longevity, but with moderate TRT and evidence of some clearance-based recovery. Imidacloprid exposures produced a hormesis with reduced longevity only at the highest doses and an absence of TRT. CONCLUSION: Our study further confirms the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. Our findings suggest that regulatory oversight of pesticides will better safeguard bee health by testing the active ingredients of farmland agrochemicals for their capacity to produce TRT in these ecologically important nontarget organisms. Our study demonstrates the potential for certain dietary insecticides at trace levels to harm farmland bumble bees during sustained exposures because of their capacity to cause time-reinforced toxicity. ¬© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2020 Society of Chemical Industry",2020///,2020,10.1002/ps.5838,76,8,2846,2853,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084042182&doi=10.1002%2fps.5838&partnerID=40&md5=8fb2e37720e159166211042ced5ab260,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Apoidea', 'toxicity', 'thiamethoxam', 'agricultural land', 'nectar', 'longevity', 'Thiamethoxam', 'neonicotinoids', 'Bombus terrestris', 'fipronil', 'pyrazole derivative', 'Pyrazoles', 'dietary intake', 'Bombus (genus)', 'pollinators', 'diet', 'Diet', 'Farms', 'dietary exposure', 'Dietary Exposure', 'time dependent behavior', 'time reinforcement']",,,,,0,
808,JOUR,Exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to three different active ingredients and two application methods for olive pest control,"['Varikou, K', 'Garantonakis, N', 'Birouraki, A']",ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS,"A potential cause of bumblebee losses on farmland is probably the toxic effects of insecticides used against crop pests. The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is a major pest of olive trees in Mediterranean countries, so spray treatments (cover and bait sprays) are applied for this and other minor pests starting in early spring. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three pesticide spraying solutions (alpha-cypennethrin, dimethoate, and spinosad) and control methods used against olive fruit flies and other olive tree pests, on adult buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The results indicated that exposing worker bumblebees to enviromnentally realistic levels of these active ingredients in the laboratory resulted in high mortality rates of 34% (alpha-cypermethrin, cover spray) and 54% (alpha-cypermethrin, bait spray) at the end of the three-day exposure period. Bumblebees are probably at a high risk of mortality when they forage in olive groves with dry residues of a bait solution of a-cypennethrin (which resulted in 54% mortality in this study). Spinosad and dimethoate posed a lower risk of mortality for bumblebees. However, when the tested chemicals were applied to the whole tree canopy and without the bait attractant, the recorded mortality for dimethoate and a-cypennethrin was 8% and 34%, respectively. This study contributes to optimizing the use of the tested active ingredients as well as the applied control methods against managed pests, because it inflicts definite damage to populations of bumble bees and other non-target pollination.",2019///,2019,10.1127/entomologia/2019/0706,39,1,53,60,,,,0171-8177,WOS:000478952500006,,,0,
572,JOUR,Combined effects of three insecticides with different modes of action on biochemical responses of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis,"['Misiewicz, A.', 'Filipiak, Z.M.', 'Kadyrova, K.', 'Bednarska, A.J.']",Chemosphere,"Bees are simultaneously exposed to a variety of pesticides, which are often applied in mixtures and can cause lethal and sublethal effects. The combined effects of pesticides, however, are not measured in the current risk assessment schemes. Additionally, the sublethal effects of pesticides on a variety of physiological processes are poorly recognized in bees, especially in non-Apis solitary bees. In this study, we used a full-factorial design to examine the main and interactive effects of three insecticide formulations with different modes of action (Mospilan 20 SP, Sherpa 100 EC, and Dursban 480 EC) on bee biochemical processes. We measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) activities, as well as a nonenzymatic biomarker associated with energy metabolism, i.e., ATP level. All studied endpoints were affected by Sherpa 100 EC, and the activities of AChE and EST as well as ATP levels were affected by Dursban 480 EC. Moreover, complex interactions between all three insecticides affected ATP levels, showing outcomes that cannot be predicted when testing each insecticide separately. The results indicate that even if interactive effects are sometimes difficult to interpret, there is a need to study such interactions if laboratory-generated toxicity data are to be extrapolated to field conditions. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142233,359,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192861222&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.142233&partnerID=40&md5=121d53bf051e8c1b855252a72def5418,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pyrethroid', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'toxicity', 'Sublethal effects', 'adult', 'mortality', 'Toxicity', 'body mass', 'Pollinators', 'Pollinator', 'metabolism', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'enzyme activity', 'Combined effect', 'physiological process', 'physiological response', 'biomarker', 'chlorpyrifos', 'Metabolism', 'Esters', 'antagonistic effect', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'energy metabolism', 'esterase', 'Esterase', 'Esterases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Enzymes', 'biochemistry', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Peptides', 'ATP', 'ATP level', 'factorial design', 'Glutathione S-Transferase', 'Glutathione S-transferases', 'Interactive effect', 'Mixture toxicity', 'Mode of action']",,,,,0,

Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98Œºgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98Œºg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98Œºgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11Œºgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100,1,153,158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892602774&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2013.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=ec4e0e2e11fd0cfd95e2ea6500fb0294,Scopus,,,,,,0,
561,JOUR,Quantifying exposure of wild bumblebees to mixtures of agrochemicals in agricultural and urban landscapes,"['Bot√≠as, C', 'David, A', 'Hill, EM', 'Goulson, D']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

17,JOUR,Sub-lethal effects of dietary neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on honey bee queen fecundity and colony development,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Scientific Reports,"Many factors can negatively affect honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) health including the pervasive use of systemic neonicotinoid insecticides. Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-Term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure. ¬© The Author(s) 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep32108,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984690386&doi=10.1038%2fsrep32108&partnerID=40&md5=e4a56e5fa82ba7e8148aa6852c92504d,Scopus,,,,,,0,

To explore potential colony-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide at field-relevant concentrations, honey bee colonies were fed 5- and 20-ppb concentrations of clothianidin in sugar syrup while control colonies were fed unadulterated syrup. Two experiments were conducted in successive years at the same site in southern Arizona, and one in the high rainfall environment of Mississippi. Across all three experiments, adult bee masses were about 21% lower among colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin than the untreated control group, but no effects of treatment on brood production were observed. Average daily hive weight losses per day in the 5-ppb clothianidin colonies were about 39% lower post-treatment than in the 20-ppb clothianidin colonies, indicating lower consumption and/or better foraging, but the dry weights of newly-emerged adult bees were on average 6‚Äì7% lower in the 5-ppb group compared to the other groups, suggesting a nutritional problem in the 5-ppb group. Internal hive CO2 concentration was higher on average in colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin, which could have resulted from greater CO2 production and/or reduced ventilating activity. Hive temperature average and daily variability were not affected by clothianidin exposure but did differ significantly among trials. Clothianidin was found to be, like imidacloprid, highly stable in honey in the hive environment over several months. ¬© 2021, The Author(s).",2021///,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-83958-8,11,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101546346&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-021-83958-8&partnerID=40&md5=704247c519c5ee0f9232adb78c03da65,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'carbon dioxide', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'clothianidin', 'drug effect', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'physiology', 'social behavior', 'Social Behavior', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles']",,,,,0,

However, limited information is available on the pesticide effects on solitary bees, especially in Neotropical countries. In this scenario, this study evaluated the survival and histopathological effects caused by the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) in the midgut and parietal fat body of the solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male newly-emerged bees were orally exposed for 48 h to the pesticides, or alone or in combination, under laboratory conditions. The exposure to the insecticide reduced the survival of males, while the mixture reduced survival in both sexes. Acetamiprid promoted a reduction in the number of regenerative nests in the midgut, alterations of fat body cells by increasing carbohydrates in trophocytes, and reduction of oenocyte size, and increased the frequency of pericardial cells in the advanced activity stage. Both pesticides caused changes in HSP70 immunolabelling of midgut from males at the end of pesticide exposure. Comparatively, the effects on males were stronger than in females exposed to the same pesticides. Therefore, acetamiprid alone and in mixture with fungicide azoxystrobin can be harmful to males and females of Neotropical solitary bee C. analis showing lethal and sublethal effects at a concentration likely to be found in the environment. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124712,360,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201012084&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124712&partnerID=40&md5=473fb0290f046c3ad77add42df7197ea,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'Pesticide', 'survival', 'adult', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'midgut', 'Survival', 'antibody labeling', 'Fat body', 'fungicide', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'histopathology', 'Pyrimidines', 'fat pad', 'chemical pollutant', 'Azoxystrobin', 'RNA interference', '% reductions', 'sex difference', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'fertility', 'aubergine', 'cell adhesion', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP', 'gender', 'Hsp70', 'Limited information', 'Malpighiales', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid']",,,,,0,

Accumulating evidence has shown that pesticides, including neonicotinoids, can have a range of adverse effects on bumble bee health. Most laboratory studies that assess the effects of chronic neonicotinoid exposure on bumble bees use syrup as the delivery vehicle, rather than pollen. However, in the field, it is likely that bumble bees are exposed to neonicotinoids in both nectar (syrup) and pollen. To examine the potential for different effects based on the vehicle, we compared two studies of chronic exposure to the neonicotinoid acetamiprid in Bombus impatiens microcolonies. We examined correlations between microcolony endpoints and identified associations between the timing of colony pollen and syrup consumption and drone production. Furthermore, in line with previous results, we found that average drone weight was affected at a range of doses only when microcolonies were exposed to acetamiprid via pollen. In general, our analyses point to the importance of the treatment vehicle and suggest that critical effects on developing brood could be missed when neonicotinoid exposure occurs only through syrup.  ¬© 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.",2022///,2022,10.1093/ee/nvac026,51,3,613,620,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132453934&doi=10.1093%2fee%2fnvac026&partnerID=40&md5=2728846ff34afcdae226195959cfc3e8,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bumble bee', 'drone', 'Hymenoptera', 'microcolony', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'pollinator', 'risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'sublethal']",,,,,0,

In part, the lack of consensus reflects a shortage of information on field-realistic levels of exposure. Here, we quantify concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides and fungicides in the pollen of oilseed rape, and in pollen of wildflowers growing near arable fields. We then compare this to concentrations of these pesticides found in pollen collected by honey bees and in pollen and adult bees sampled from bumble bee colonies placed on arable farms. We also compared this with levels found in bumble bee colonies placed in urban areas. Pollen of oilseed rape was heavily contaminated with a broad range of pesticides, as was the pollen of wildflowers growing nearby. Consequently, pollen collected by both bee species also contained a wide range of pesticides, notably including the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, flusilazole, metconazole, tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin and the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In bumble bees, the fungicides carbendazim, boscalid, tebuconazole, flusilazole and metconazole were present at concentrations up to 73. nanogram/gram (ng/g). It is notable that pollen collected by bumble bees in rural areas contained high levels of the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (mean 18. ng/g) and thiacloprid (mean 2.9. ng/g), along with a range of fungicides, some of which are known to act synergistically with neonicotinoids.

Despite being important pollinators, solitary ground-nesting bees are inadequately represented by pesticide risk assessments reliant almost exclusively on honeybee ecotoxicology. Here we evaluate the effects of realistic exposure via squash crops treated with systemic insecticides (Admire-imidacloprid soil application, FarMore FI400-thiamethoxam seed-coating, or Coragen-chlorantraniliprole foliar spray) for a ground-nesting bee species (Hoary squash bee,¬†Eucera pruinosa) in a 3-year semi-field experiment. Hoary squash bees provide essential pollination services to pumpkin and squash crops and commonly nest within cropping areas increasing their risk of pesticide exposure from soil, nectar, and pollen.

No measurable impacts on bees from exposure to squash treated with thiamethoxam as a seed-coating or foliage sprayed with chlorantraniliprole were found. Our results demonstrate important sublethal effects of field-realistic exposure to a soil-applied neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bee behaviour and reproductive success.

5,JOUR,Effects of a chronic dietary exposure of the honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) to imidacloprid,"['Schmuck, R']",ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY,"Previous studies have shown that imidacloprid and insecticidally active imidacloprid plant metabolites are rapidly metabolized by honeybees. Accordingly, no striking differences were expected between the acute and the chronic dietary toxicity of imidacloprid to honeybees. More recently, however, an unexpectedly high chronic dietary toxicity to honeybees was reported for imidacloprid and imidacloprid plant metabolites, and a novel pharmacologic mechanism unrelated to the parent toxophor was postulated. In an extensive literature survey, no further evidence was found for the reported high difference between the acute and the chronic dietary toxicity of imidacloprid and its plant metabolites to honeybees. The majority of data indicated a dietary no observed lethal-effect concentration >0.04 and 0.02 mg/L 50% sucrose solution, respectively, for an acute and a chronic dietary exposure of honeybees to either imidacloprid or its plant metabolites. Findings of chronic feeding studies with those plant metabolites where the toxophor had already been cleaved did not support the hypotheses of a novel pharmacologic mechanism unrelated to the parent toxophor. No increased treatment-related mortality or behavioral abnormalities were recorded in four independent research facilities during a 10-day dietary exposure of honeybees of different ages to sucrose solutions spiked with the respective metabolites at 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.010 mg/L 50% sucrose solution.",2004/10//,2004,10.1007/s00244-004-3057-6,47,4,471,478,,,,0090-4341,WOS:000224753800006,,,0,
782,JOUR,Botanical and synthetic pesticides alter the flower visitation rates of pollinator bees in Neotropical melon fields,"['Tschoeke, PH', 'Oliveira, EE', 'Dalcin, MS', 'Silveira-Tschoeke, MCAC', 'Sarmento, RA', 'Santos, GR']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The ecological and economic contributions of pollinator bees to agricultural production have been threatened by the inappropriate and excessive use of pesticides. These pesticides are often applied in areas with ecological peculiarities (e.g., the Neotropical savannah-like region termed as Cerrado) that were not considered during the product development. Here, we conducted field experiments with melon (i.e., Cucumis melo L.) plants cultivated under Brazilian Cerrado conditions and evaluated the impacts of botanical (i.e., neem-based insecticide) and synthetic (i.e., the pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil) pesticides on the flower visitation rates of naturally occurring pollinator bees. Our results revealed that both honey bees (i.e., Apis mellifera L) and non-Apis bees visited melon flowers and the intensity of bee visitation was moderately correlated with yield parameters (e.g., number of marketable fruits and fruit yield). Pesticide treatments differentially affected bee species. For instance, Plebeia sp. bees were not affected by any pesticide treatment, whereas both A. mellifera and Halictus sp. bees showed reduced visitation intensity after the application of deltamethrin or neem-based insecticides. Fungicide treatment alone did not influence the bee's visitation intensity. Deltamethrin-treated melon fields produced significantly lighter marketable fruits, and the melon yield was significantly lower in melon fields treated with the neem-based insecticide. Thus, our findings with such pollinator bees reinforce the idea that field applications of botanical pesticides may represent as risky as the applications of synthetic compounds, indicating that these alternative products should be submitted to risk assessments comparable to those required for synthetic products.

748,JOUR,Reduced species richness of native bees in field margins associated with neonicotinoid concentrations in non-target soils,"['Main, A.R.', 'Webb, E.B.', 'Goyne, K.W.', 'Mengel, D.']","Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","Native bees are in decline as many species are sensitive to habitat loss, climate change, and non-target exposure to synthetic pesticides. Recent laboratory and semi-field assessments of pesticide impacts on bees have focused on neonicotinoid insecticides. However, field studies evaluating influences of neonicotinoid seed treatments on native bee communities of North America are absent from the literature. On four Conservation Areas of Missouri, we sampled row-cropped (treated, n = 15) and reference (untreated, n = 9) agricultural fields, and their surrounding field margins for neonicotinoids in soil and non-target vegetation (i.e., native wildflowers). Wildflowers were further collected and screened for the presence of fungicides. Concurrently, we sampled native bees over three discrete time points throughout the agricultural growing season to assess potential impacts of seed treatment use on local bee populations over time. Neonicotinoids were detected in 87% to 100% of treated field soils and 22% to 56% of reference field soils. In adjacent field margin soils, quantifiable concentrations were measured near treated (53% to 93% detection) and untreated fields (33% to 56% detection). Fungicides were detected in < 40% of wildflowers, whereas neonicotinoids were rarely detected in field margin vegetation (< 7%). Neonicotinoid concentrations in margin soils were negatively associated with native bee richness (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.21, P < 0.05). Field margins with a combination of greater neonicotinoid concentrations in soil and fungicides in wildflowers also contained fewer wild bee species (Œ≤ = ‚àí0.21, P < 0.001). By comparison, bee abundance was positively influenced by the number of wildflower species in bloom with no apparent impact of pesticides. Results of this study indicate that neonicotinoids in soil are a potential route of exposure for pollinator communities, specifically ground-nesting species. Importantly, native bee richness in non-target field margins may be negatively affected by the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in agroecosystems. ¬© 2019",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.agee.2019.106693,287,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073119095&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2019.106693&partnerID=40&md5=0bfbf3f855693a266ebf3b63d62d22a7,Scopus,,,,,,0,
36,JOUR,Risk assessment for side-effects of neonicotinoids against bumblebees with and without impairing foraging behavior,"['Mommaerts, V.', 'Reynders, S.', 'Boulet, J.', 'Besard, L.', 'Sterk, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Ecotoxicology,"Bombus terrestris bumblebees are important pollinators of wild flowers, and in modern agriculture they are used to guarantee pollination of vegetables and fruits. In the field it is likely that worker bees are exposed to pesticides during foraging. To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2010///,2010,10.1007/s10646-009-0406-2,19,1,207,215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77249087124&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-009-0406-2&partnerID=40&md5=0a4b49f9dcca309b6d08542d84bf255f,Scopus,,,,,,0,
806,JOUR,Extrapolating Acute Contact Bee Sensitivity to Insecticides Based on Body Weight Using a Phylogenetically Informed Interspecies Scaling Framework,"['Pamminger, T.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Plant protection products, including insecticides, are important for global food production but can have adverse effects on nontarget organisms including bees. Historically, research investigating such effects has focused mainly on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), whereas less information is available for non-Apis bees. Consequently, a comprehensive hazard (sensitivity) assessment for the majority of bees is lacking, which in turn hinders accurate risk characterization and consequently bee protection. Interspecies sensitivity extrapolation based on body weight might be a way to improve the situation, but in the past such approaches often ignored the phylogenetic background of the species used, which in turn potentially reduces the robustness of such results. Published acute contact sensitivity data (median lethal dose per bee) of bees to insecticides, their body weight, and their phylogenetic background were used to build interspecies scaling models to predict bee sensitivity based on their weight. The results indicate that 1) bee body weight is a predictor of acute contact bee sensitivity to a range of insecticides, and 2) phylogeny (nonindependence of data points) needs to be considered in cross-species analysis, although it does not always confound the observed effects.

727,JOUR,Phylogenomic and functional characterization of an evolutionary conserved cytochrome P450-based insecticide detoxification mechanism in bees,"['Haas, J.', 'Hayward, A.', 'Buer, B.', 'Maiwald, F.', 'Nebelsiek, B.', 'Glaubitz, J.', 'Bass, C.', 'Nauen, R.']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"The regulatory process for assessing the risks of pesticides to bees relies heavily on the use of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, as a model for other bee species. However, the validity of using A. mellifera as a surrogate for other Apis and non-Apis bees in pesticide risk assessment has been questioned. Related to this line of research, recent work on A. mellifera has shown that specific P450 enzymes belonging to the CYP9Q subfamily act as critically important determinants of insecticide sensitivity in this species by efficiently detoxifying certain insecticide chemotypes. However, the extent to which the presence of functional orthologs of these enzymes is conserved across the diversity of bees is unclear. Here we used a phylogenomic approach to identify > 100 putative CYP9Q functional orthologs across 75 bee species encompassing all major bee families. Functional analysis of 26 P450s from 20 representative bee species revealed that P450-mediated detoxification of certain systemic insecticides, including the neonicotinoid thiacloprid and the butenolide flupyradifurone, is conserved across all major bee pollinator families. However, our analyses also reveal that CYP9Q-related genes are not universal to all bee species, with some Megachilidae species lacking such genes. Thus, our results reveal an evolutionary conserved capacity to metabolize certain insecticides across all major bee families while identifying a small number of bee species where this function may have been lost. Furthermore, they illustrate the potential of a toxicogenomic approach to inform pesticide risk assessment for nonmanaged bee species by predicting the capability of bee pollinator species to break down synthetic insecticides. copyright ¬© 2022 the Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1073/pnas.2205850119,119,26,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85132610042&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.2205850119&partnerID=40&md5=579780eeca3117a78142229699456780,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'bee pollination', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'thiacloprid', 'animal cell', 'metabolism', 'phylogeny', 'Phylogeny', 'genetics', 'bioinformatics', 'cytochrome P450', 'detoxification', 'butenolide', 'prediction', 'genetic analysis', 'biochemical analysis', 'Megachilidae', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'species identification', 'gene identification', 'genetic conservation', 'gene sequence', 'phylogenomics', 'toxicogenomics', 'Biological Evolution', 'cytochrome P450 family 3', 'evolution', 'gene locus', 'orthology', 'P450', 'synteny']",,,,,0,

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls.

One conspicuous threat to bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary imidacloprid between zero and 125 Œºg L -1 and examined the effects on ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the range of 1 lg L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third. In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage, microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood. We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the fecundity of bumble bee queens. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10646-012-0927-y,21,7,1937,1945,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868128229&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-012-0927-y&partnerID=40&md5=890b4ccf728569521f0bac26b6f3d864,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Bumble bees are important wild pollinators that are widely exposed to dietary neonicotinoids by foraging in agricultural environments. In the laboratory, we tested the effect of a pulsed exposure (14 days 'on dose' followed by 14 days 'off dose') to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on the amount of brood (number of eggs and larvae) produced by Bombus terrestris L. bumble bees in small, standardised experimental colonies (a queen and four adult workers). During the initial 'on dose' period we observed a dose-dependent repression of brood production in colonies, with productivity decreasing as dosage increased up to 98 Œºg kg-1 dietary imidacloprid. During the following 'off dose' period, colonies showed a dose-dependent recuperation such that total brood production during the 28-day pulsed exposure was not correlated with imidacloprid up to 98 Œºg kg-1.

However, these bees may be exposed to pesticides during foraging, which can affect both individuals and their colonies. One example comes from the use of pyraclostrobin (a fungicide) and thiamethoxam (an insecticide) for pest control in pepper crops, which F. varia visits. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined sublethal effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) (0.000543 ng a.i./¬µL) and pyraclostrobin (PYR) (1.5 ng i.a./¬µL) on the morphology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of F. varia workers. Results showed that both pesticides, regardless of the exposure time (through feeding during 48 h or 96 h), disturbed the morphology of the analyzed organs. Specifically, F. varia exposed orally to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin, either alone or in combination, exhibited a higher rate of damage to the midgut (e.g., vacuolization, apocrine secretion, and cellular elimination) compared to the bees in the control groups, both after 48 h and 96 h of exposure. In Malpighian tubules, vacuolation is the only damage present. As the observed morphological alterations likely compromise the excretion and absorption functions, exposure to pyraclostrobin and thiamethoxam may lead to disturbances at both the individual and colony levels.

15,JOUR,Assessment of chronic sublethal effects of imidacloprid on honey bee colony health,"['Dively, G.P.', 'Embrey, M.S.', 'Kamel, A.', 'Hawthorne, D.J.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",PLoS ONE,"Here we present results of a three-year study to determine the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on whole honey bee colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 Œºg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 Œºg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 Œºg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 Œºg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 Œºg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. ¬© 2015, Public Library of Science.

Caffeine alone or with 2.0¬†ng/mL imidacloprid also stimulated the activity of glutathione peroxidase but did not alter the effect of the insecticide on the catalase activity. A significant reduction in the concentration of the thiol group of proteins was observed in the two imidacloprid-fed groups, and the addition of caffeine protected these groups. Imidacloprid increased the malondialdehyde concentration while the addition of caffeine partially decreased this effect. Food intake was higher for bees treated with 2.0¬†ng/mL imidacloprid. Our results show that imidacloprid increased the food intake resulting in oxidative damage, which was partially reversed by caffeine.

Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life-history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis. We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male-biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non-Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness-related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long-term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life-cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model. ¬© 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.",2014///,2014,10.1111/afe.12041,16,2,119,128,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898032154&doi=10.1111%2fafe.12041&partnerID=40&md5=14ae763ede7ad931d27086e2731bfa60,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Assuming bees can forage naturally on pesticide-contaminated or noncontaminated areas, we investigated whether water supply influences the choice between neonicotinoid-dosed or nondosed feeders and on mortality of the stingless bee, Melipona scutellaris (Latreille, Hymenoptera, Apidae). At the field concentration, there was no significant mortality; however, the bees were not able to distinguish the feeders. In the cages containing high-concentration feeders, with water supply, the bees preferred nondosed food, and with no water, the mortality increased.

One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation.

834,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee autogrooming behavior against the tracheal mite Acarapis woodi,"['Sakamoto, Y.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Maeda, T.', 'Goka, K.']",Ecotoxicology,"The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most common and important pollinator of crops worldwide. Honey bees are damaged by destructive parasitic mites, but they also have evolved a behavioral immune system to remove them. Exposures to neonicotinoids, however, can cause significant behavioral effects because these compounds alter the central role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in insect brains. In this study, we assessed the effects of three neonicotinoids that have a high toxicity to bees‚Äîimidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin‚Äîon the behavioral immune system of honey bees. We used A. mellifera and the endoparasitic mite Acarapis woodi as a behavioral immune system model because A. mellifera can effectively remove the mite by autogrooming. Our results did not demonstrate an effect of neonicotinoid application on whether bees show autogrooming or on mite removal, but the time to initial autogrooming became shorter and the number of autogrooming attempts increased. As opposed to previous studies, our findings indicate that the honey bee response to parasitic mites becomes more sensitive after exposure to neonicotinoids.

Effects of imidacloprid food stores contaminants were examined in subtropical colonies that experience reduced brood rearing and foraging during overwintering. Colonies were given treatment sugar syrup containing 0 ppb (control), 20 ppb (field relevant), or 100 ppb (above field relevant) imidacloprid over six weeks to simulate contaminated fall nectar. Colonies were evaluated immediately (post-treatment) and 10 weeks (mid-winter) after treatment to compare proximal and latent effects. Post-treatment 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies while 0 ppb colonies more brood than 20 ppb or 100 ppb colonies. Mid-winter 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies and 0 ppb colonies more brood than 100 ppb colonies. Colonies experienced seasonal declines in stored pollen but no treatment effects. Lower 100 ppb colony performance was associated with reduced effort rather than lifespan. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking revealed that workers had similar adult lifespans across treatments; however, 100 ppb workers engaged in activities outside the colony for less time than 0 ppb workers. Imidacloprid exposure affected queen but not worker nutritional physiology. Nurses retained well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (as indicated by head protein) across treatments. Mid-winter queens from 0 ppb colonies had marginally higher ovary protein than queens from 100 ppb colonies and more ovary lipids than queens from 20 ppb colonies. However, queen nutrient stores in non-reproductive tissues (fat bodies) did not differ across treatments. Queens from different treatments were attended by comparable numbers of retinue workers and had similar gland contents of four QMP (Queen Mandibular Pheromone) components essential to queen care.

731,JOUR,tau-Fluvalinate and other pesticide residues in honey bees before overwintering,"['Erban, T.', 'Vaclavikova, M.', 'Tomesova, D.', 'Halesova, T.', 'Hubert, J.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: Pesticides have often been linked to honey bee colony losses, which occur mainly over winter. In this study, we investigated residues in nine colonies at a model agricultural research site during the period before wintering. Moreover, we applied the acaricide tau-fluvalinate to the colonies via a strip formulation. The pesticide content was determined by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in bees from brood comb initially collected in mid-September immediately prior to the start of tau-fluvalinate treatment and 30 later at the time of tau-fluvalinate strip removal. RESULTS: In addition to commonly analyzed pesticides, we detected two plant growth regulators, chlormequat and metazachlor, in the bee colonies. Whereas thiacloprid, chlormequat and acetamiprid decreased after 30 days and contributed considerably to differences between sample time points, other pesticides appeared to be rather stable. Interestingly, we identified diazinon, which has been banned in the European Union since 2007. The residues of methiocarb sulfoxide and imidacloprid-urea in the absence of their parent compounds indicate historical environmental contamination that can be identified by the detection of residues in a bee colony. tau-Fluvalinate was detected only after the 30-day treatment at an average (¬± SD) concentration of 1.29 ¬± 1.93 ng/bee, ranging from 0.06 to 7.13 ng/bee. CONCLUSION: The multidimensional behavior of pesticides in a bee colony was indicated. Although the research area is used for agriculture, the measured pesticide level was relatively low. The recorded concentrations of tau-fluvalinate should not be dangerous to bees, as the values were ‚àº 200‚Äì5000-fold lower than the reported median lethal dose (LD50) values. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2019///,2019,10.1002/ps.5446,75,12,3245,3251,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066014324&doi=10.1002%2fps.5446&partnerID=40&md5=50de8a4665b1ace96fa7a1935d03ee09,Scopus,,,,,,0,
762,JOUR,Functional orthologs of honeybee CYP6AQ1 in stingless bees degrade the butenolide insecticide flupyradifurone,"['Xiao, XZ', 'Haas, J', 'Nauen, R']",ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY,"Flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel butenolide insecticide binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), has been shown to be less acutely toxic to western honey bees (Apis mellifera) than other insecticides such as neonicotinoids sharing the same target-site. A previous study revealed that this is due to enhanced oxidative metabolism of FPF, mediated by three cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), including CYP6AQ1. Therefore, we followed a toxicogenomics approach and investigated the potential role of functional CYP6AQ1 orthologs in FPF metabolism from eight different bee species, including stingless bees (Tribe: Meliponini). We conducted a phylogenetic analysis on four stingless bee species, including Frieseomelitta varia, Heterotrigona itama, Melipona quadrifasciata and Tetragonula carbonaria to identify CYP6AQ1-like functional orthologs. Three non-Meliponini, but tropical bee species, i.e., Ammobates syriacus, Euglossa dilemma and Megalopta genalis were analyzed as well. We identified candidate P450s in all (neo)tropical species with greater than 61% and 67% predicted protein sequence identities when compared to A. mellifera CYP6AQ1 and Bombus terrestris CYP6AQ26, respectively. Heterologous expression in High Five insect cells of these functional orthologs revealed a common coumarin substrate profile and a preference for the O-debenzylation of bulkier substrates. Competition assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (BOMFC) with these enzymes indicated inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by increasing concentrations of FPF. Furthermore, UPLC-MS/ MS analysis revealed the capacity of all CYP6AQ1-like orthologs to metabolize FPF by hydroxylation in vitro at various levels, indicating a conserved FPF detoxification potential in different (neo)tropical bee species including Meliponini. This research, employing a toxicogenomics approach, provides important insights into the potential of stingless and other tropical bee species to detoxify FPF, and highlights the significance of investigating the detoxification mechanisms of insecticides in non-Apis bee species by molecular tools to inform risk assessment and conservation efforts.",2023/12//,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115719,268,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'nicotinic receptor', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'liquid chromatography', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'acute toxicity', 'stingless bee', 'Bombus terrestris', 'animal cell', 'unclassified drug', 'Pollinators', 'in vitro study', 'metabolism', 'bioassay', 'phylogeny', 'Phylogeny', 'genetics', 'cytochrome P450', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'flupyradifurone', 'butenolide', 'Flupyradifurone', 'Meliponini', 'amino acid sequence', 'inhibition', 'degradation', 'insect cell', 'aerobic metabolism', 'fluorescent dye', 'coumarin', 'Cytochrome P450', 'debenzylation', 'heterologous expression', 'hydroxylation', 'phylogenetics', 'toxicogenomics', 'Toxicogenomics']",0147-6513,WOS:001125945200001,,,0,

Existing designs tend to focus on single crops, even though highly mobile bees routinely forage across crop boundaries. We created fields of pollinator-dependent watermelon surrounded by corn, regionally important crops in the Midwestern US. These fields were paired at multiple sites in 2017-2020 with the only difference being pest management regimes: a standard set of conventional management (CM) practices vs. an integrated pest management (IPM) system that uses scouting and pest thresholds to determine if/when insecticides are used. Between these two systems we compared the performance (e.g., growth, survival) of managed pollinators-honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)-along with the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators. Compared to CM fields, IPM led to higher growth and lower mortality of managed bees, while also increasing the abundance (+ 147%) and richness (+ 128%) of wild pollinator species, and lower concentrations of neonicotinoids in the hive material of both managed bees.

Here, we combined physiological experiments with a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to understand the molecular basis of genetic variation that responds to sublethal imidacloprid at different exposure durations in A. cerana. We found that LC5 dose of imidacloprid had a negative impact on climbing ability and sucrose responsiveness in A. cerana. When bees were fed with LC5 dose of imidacloprid, the enzyme activities of P450 and CarE were decreased, while the GSTs activity was not influenced by the pesticide exposure. The dynamic transcriptomic profiles of A. cerana workers exposed to LC5 dose of imidacloprid for 1 h, 8 h, and 16 h were obtained by high-throughput RNA-sequencing. We performed the expression patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through trend analysis, and conducted the gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis with DEGs in up-and down-regulated pattern profiles. We observed that more genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and structural molecule activity are down-regulated; while more up-regulated genes were enriched in terms associated with response to stimulus, transporter activity, and signal transducer activity. Additionally, genes related to the phenylalanine metabolism pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and mTOR signaling pathway as indicated in the KEGG analysis were significantly up-related in the exposed bees.

CpTI (Cowpea Trypsin Inhibitor) cotton cultivar CCRI41 is increasingly used in China and potential side effects on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. have been documented recently. Two studies have assessed potential lethal and sublethal effects in young bees fed with CCRI41 cotton pollen but no effect was observed on learning capacities, although lower feeding activity in exposed honey bees was noted (antifeedant effect). The present study aimed at providing further insights into potential side effects of CCRI41 cotton on honey bees. Emerging honey bees were exposed to different pollen diets using no-choice feeding protocols (chronic exposure) in controlled laboratory conditions and we aimed at documenting potential mechanisms underneath the CCRI41 antifeedant effect previously reported. Activity of midgut proteolytic enzyme of young adult honey bees fed on CCRI41 cotton pollen were not significantly affected, i.e. previously observed antifeedant effect was not linked to disturbed activity of the proteolytic enzymes in bees' midgut. Hypopharyngeal gland development was assessed by quantifying total extractable proteins from the glands. Results suggested that CCRI41 cotton pollen carries no risk to hypopharyngeal gland development of young adult honey bees. In the two bioassays, honey bees exposed to 1 % soybean trypsin inhibitor were used as positive controls for both midgut proteolytic enzymes and hypopharyngeal gland proteins quantification, and bees exposed to 48 ppb (part per billion) (i.e. 48 ng g -1) imidacloprid were used as controls for exposure to a sublethal concentration of toxic product.

684,JOUR,Using the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera L.) Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,"['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription‚Äìquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

567,JOUR,The effect of dietary neonicotinoid pesticides on non-flight thermogenesis in worker bumble bees (Bombus terrestris),"['Potts, R.', 'Clarke, R.M.', 'Oldfield, S.E.', 'Wood, L.K.', 'Hempel de Ibarra, N.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"For bumble bees (genus Bombus), the capacity for non-flight thermogenesis is essential for two fundamental processes undertaken by adult workers, namely recovery from torpor after chilling and brood incubation. Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose‚Äìresponse relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104,,33,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034786241&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2017.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=2ec6d258462a734f7451789afb4ab060,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services. Pesticide risk assessments should include bee species other than honeybees and assess a range of behaviours to elucidate the impact of sublethal effects.

775,JOUR,Effects of Provision Type and Pesticide Exposure on the Larval Development of Osmia lignaria (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),"['Kopit, A.M.', 'Klinger, E.', 'Cox-Foster, D.L.', 'Ramirez, R.A.', 'Pitts-Singer, T.L.']",Environmental Entomology,"Wild and managed bee populations are in decline, and one of many environmental causes is the impact of pesticides on developing bees. For solitary bees, delayed larval development could lead to asynchronous adult emergence, unhealthy and inefficient adult pollinators, and decreased brood production and survival. We examined a methodology for testing Osmia lignaria Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) larval responses to pesticide exposure using a laboratory bioassay. We created two provision types: a homogenized blend of O. lignaria provisions from an apple orchard and homogenized almond pollen pellets collected by honey bees plus sugar water. Pesticides were administered to the provisions to compare toxic effects. We recorded larval developmental durations for second-fifth instar and for fifth instar to cocoon initiation for larvae fed provisions treated with water (control) or doses of three pesticides and a representative spray-tank mixture (acetamiprid, boscalid/pyraclostrobin, dimethoate, and acetamiprid plus boscalid/pyraclostrobin). All larvae survived to cocoon initiation when only water was added to provisions. Impacts of pesticide treatments significantly differed between the apple and almond homogenates. The greatest treatment effects occurred when the homogenized almond provision was mixed with acetamiprid alone and when combined with boscalid/pyraclostrobin. Optimizing bioassays through the use of appropriate larval food for exposing solitary bee larvae to agrochemicals is crucial for assessing risks for pollinators. ¬© 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2022///,2022,10.1093/ee/nvab119,51,1,240,251,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125734326&doi=10.1093%2fee%2fnvab119&partnerID=40&md5=58e901d822661f53ec85cd225efb46a0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Hymenoptera', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'survival', 'larva', 'Larva', 'pesticide residue', 'Pollen', 'bioassay', 'larval development', 'emergence', 'lethal dose', 'orchard', 'cocoon', 'solitary bee', 'almond', 'Prunus dulcis']",,,,,0,

The objective of this study was to investigate the potential impact of maize grown from imidacloprid-treated seeds on honey bee mortality. A survey of 16 apiaries was carried out, and all maize fields treated or not with imidacloprid were located within a radius of 3,000 m around the observed apiaries. Samples of honey, beeswax, and bees were collected in three colonies per apiary and analyzed for pesticide contain by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We first found a significant correlation between the number of colonies per apiary and the mortality rates in an apiary. In addition, this mortality rate was inversely correlated with the surface of maize fields treated and not with imidacloprid, suggesting that this pesticide do not interact with bees' fitness. Moreover, a very large number of our samples contained acaricides either prohibited or ineffective against Varroa destructor (Anderson & Trueman) (Acari: Varroidae), suggesting that the treatment methods used by the beekeepers to be inadequate for mite control.

From each experimental site, young workers and foraging bees were taken monthly from May to October and analyzed for four enzymatic biomarkers: acetylcholinesterase (AChE), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The results revealed time- and site-specific effects in respect to control site, confirming the role of biomarkers as diagnostic and early-warning tools for multi-stress sources on honeybees. In the electromagnetic-stress site, the effect of an over-activation of all analyzed biomarkers was observed at the end of the season. According to other literature findings, this event was related to a behavioral over-activation in a period in which bees should prepare themselves for overwintering. This finding poses potential problems for winter survival. In the pesticide-stress site, different pesticide-induced responses were identified.

Yet, such effects may vary between pesticides, dosage, application timing and pollinator assemblage in the study area. Understanding such diversity of effects is essential to enable integrated pest management practices that minimize negative impacts on pollinators. Here, we use a controlled experiment to compare different strategies of pesticide application in tomato crops: no application, low-intensity applications (every 7 days) and high-intensity application (every 3-4 days) with the last being the usual practice used by farmers in the study region. We focus on imidacloprid that is a neonicotinoid insecticide commonly used in Brazil. We show the negative effects of imidacloprid on the pollinator visitation rate of tomato flowers varied between flower visitor species. While the bee Paratrigona lineata was negatively affected by the imidacloprid application, no effects were detected when analysing all other bees as a group, indicating a null net effect. Although some studies have shown this insecticide is extremely harmful to bees' health, others showed that some bees do not avoid it, which may explain our results. However, the visitation rate recovery for P. lineata was only detected in the less than the more intensive treatment after imidacloprid applications ceased. The fact that no differences in fruit production were detected between treatments (including control blocks) could result from a null net effect of the negative effects on pollinators and positive effects on pest control.

For instance, rapid and accurate analytical procedures are currently required to better assess the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honeybee health. Since their introduction in agriculture, neonicotinoid insecticides have been blamed for being highly toxic to honeybees, possibly at the nanogram per bee level or lower. As a consequence, most of the analytical methods recently optimized have focused on the analysis of ultratraces of neonicotinoids using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques to study the effects of sublethal doses. However, recent evidences on two novel routes-seedling guttations and seed coating particulate, both associated with corn crops-that may expose honeybees to huge amounts of neonicotinoids in the field, with instantly lethal effects, suggest that selected procedures need optimizing. In the present work, a simplified ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection method for the determination of neonicotinoids in single bees has been optimized and validated. The method ensures good selectivity, good accuracy, and adequate detection limits, which make it suitable for the purpose, while maintaining its ability to evaluate exposure variability of individual bees. It has been successfully applied to the analysis of bees in free flight over an experimental sowing field, with the bees therefore being exposed to seed coating particulate released by the pneumatic drilling machine.",2013/01//,2013,10.1007/s00216-012-6338-3,405,02-Mar,1007,1014,,,,1618-2642,WOS:000313650800048,,,0,
643,JOUR,Food consumption and food exchange of caged honey bees using a radioactive labelled sugar solution,"['Brodschneider, R.', 'Libor, A.', 'Kupelwieser, V.', 'Crailsheim, K.']",PLoS ONE,"We measured the distribution of sugar solution within groups of caged honey bees (Apis mellifera) under standard in vitro laboratory conditions using 14C polyethylene glycol as a radioactive marker to analyze ingestion by individual bees after group feeding. We studied the impact of different experimental setups by varying the number of bees, age of bees, origin of bees, duration of experiment, the amount of available diet, and the influence of the neurotoxic pesticide imidacloprid in the diet on the feeding and food sharing behavior (trophallaxis). Sugar solution was non-uniformly distributed in bees in 36 out of 135 cages. As a measure of the extent to which the sugar diet was equally distributed between caged bees, we calculated the (inner 80%) intake ratio by dividing the intake of the 90th percentile bee by the intake of the 10th percentile bee. This intake ratio ranged from 1.3 to 94.8 in 133 individual cages, further supporting a non-uniform distribution of food among caged bees. We can expect a cage with 10 or 30 bees containing one bee that ingests, on average, the 8.8-fold of the bee in the same cage ingesting the smallest quantity of food. Inner 80% intake ratios were lower in experiments with a permanent or chronic offering of labelled sugar solution compared to temporary or acute feedings. After pooling the data of replicates to achieve a higher statistical power we compared different experimental setups. We found that uniform food distribution is best approached with 10 newly emerged bees per cage, which originate from a brood comb from a single colony. We also investigated the trophallaxis between caged honey bees which originally consumed the diet and newly added bees. Color marked bees were starved and added to the cages in a ratio of 10:5 or 20:20 after the initial set of bees consumed all the labelled sugar solution. The distribution of the labelled sugar solution by trophallaxis within 48 hours to added bees was 25% (10:5) or 45% (20:20) of the initial sugar solution. Imidacloprid at its median lethal dose (LD50) in the sugar solution reduced this post-feeding food transmission to 27% (20:20). Our results show that differences in food intake exist within caged bees that may lead to differential exposure that can influence the interpretation of toxicity tests. ¬© 2017 Brodschneider et al.

The global decline of insects is therefore a cause for concern, and the role of chemical pesticides must be examined carefully. The lethal effects of insecticides are well understood, but sub-lethal concentrations have not been studied in sufficient detail. We therefore used the western honeybee Apis mellifera as a model to test the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin on the movement, biosensory abilities and odor-dependent conditioning of insects, titrating from lethal to sub-lethal doses. Bees treated with sub-lethal doses showed no significant movement impairment compared to untreated control bees, but their ability to react to an aversive stimulus was inhibited. These results show that clothianidin is not only highly toxic to honeybees, but can, at lower doses, also disrupt the biosensory capabilities of survivors, probably reducing fitness at the individual level.

662,JOUR,Melatonin enhances the antioxidant capacity to rescue the honey bee Apis mellifera from the ecotoxicological effects caused by environmental imidacloprid,"['Li, Z.', 'Duan, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Qin, Q.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees. Melatonin secretion may be a defense mechanism to mitigate imidacloprid toxicity. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113622,239,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134600223&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2022.113622&partnerID=40&md5=dfb131e5e7edc48e5b87ea1ce00d95a6,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'survival', 'mortality', 'gene expression', 'Imidacloprid', 'animal cell', 'apoptosis', 'caspase 3', 'catalase', 'gene', 'unclassified drug', 'animal tissue', 'midgut', 'metabolism', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'detoxification', 'tissue injury', 'enzyme activity', 'pilot study', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'cytotoxicity', 'animal model', 'oxidative stress', 'cell damage', 'antioxidant', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Oxidative stress', 'melatonin', 'hormone synthesis', 'Antioxidants', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'glutathione', 'malonaldehyde', 'Pilot Projects', 'antioxidant activity', 'lipid peroxidation', 'CYP4G11 gene', 'Antioxidant', 'apoptosis inducing factor', 'Caspase 3', 'cytochrome P450 4G11', 'gene induction', 'guaiacol peroxidase', 'hormone release', 'intestine cell', 'Melatonin', 'thioredoxin reductase']",,,,,0,

Cholinergic pesticides and their extensive use have been correlated to the decline of pollinators and there is evidence that pesticides act as neuroendocrine disruptors affecting the metabolism of neuropeptides. However, there is a big absence of studies with quantitative results correlating the effect of pesticide exposure with changes on neuropeptides insects, and most of them are conducted under laboratory conditions, typically with individual active ingredients. In this study, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate pesticide effects on honey bees through the analysis of (neuro)peptides. The workflow consists of a rapid extraction method and liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole for preselected neuropeptides. For non-target analysis, high resolution mass spectrometry, multivariate analysis and automatic identification of discriminated peptides using a specific software and protein sequence databases. The analytical method was applied to the analysis of target and non-target (neuro)peptides in honey bees with low and high content of a wide range of pesticides to which have been exposed in field conditions. Our findings show that the identification frequency of target neuropeptides decreases significantly in honey bees with high concentration of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ‚â• 500 Œºg kg‚àí1) in comparison with the honey bees with low content of pesticides (pesticide concentrations ‚â§ 20 Œºg kg‚àí1). Moreover, the principal component analysis in non-target search shows a clear distinction between peptide concentration in honey bees with high level of pesticides and honey bees with low level. The use of high resolution mass spectrometry has allowed the identification of 25 non-redundant peptides responsible for discrimination between the two groups, derived from 18 precursor proteins. It has been shown a correlation between pesticide exposure and a decrease of some neuropeptides and other head peptides in honey bees. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.envpol.2017.12.091,235,,750,760,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041685050&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2017.12.091&partnerID=40&md5=af5b9fa3b3bedf115c723cb3cb6917f4,Scopus,,,,,,0,

The challenges of navigating and learning to manipulate many different flowers underline the critical role learning plays for the foraging success and survival of bees. We assessed the impacts of both acute and chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of a widely applied neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on bumblebee odour learning and memory. Although bees exposed to acute doses showed conditioned responses less frequently than controls, we found no difference in the number of individuals able to learn at field-realistic exposure levels. However, following chronic pesticide exposure, bees exposed to field-realistic levels learnt more slowly and their short-term memory was significantly impaired following exposure to 2.4 ppb pesticide. These results indicate that field-realistic pesticide exposure can have appreciable impacts on learning and memory, with potential implications for essential individual behaviour and colony fitness.",2015/11/16/,2015,10.1038/srep16508,5,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000364667600001,,,0,

Clothianidin,"['Solomon, K.R.', 'Stephenson, G.L.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess higher tier studies on the effects of clothianidin (CTD) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25¬†¬µg CTD/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse effect-dose (NOAED) of 7.3¬†ng/bee/d for all responses measured. Based on a NOAEC of 19.7¬†¬µg/kg pollen, the NOAED for honeybee larvae was 2.4¬†ng/bee larva/d. For exposures via dust, a no-observed-adverse effect rate of 4¬†g CTD/ha was used to assess relevance of exposures via deposition of dust. The overall weight of evidence suggested that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to CTD from its use as a seed treatment. For exposures via dust, dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, there were no exposures greater than the NOAED for CTD in nectar and pollen, indicating a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure was via uptake in plants. Analysis of effect studies in the field indicated a consistent lack of relevant effects, regardless of the way CTD was applied. For exposures via dust, there were no adverse effects because of these applications and there were no exposures greater than the NOAED for CTD in nectar and pollen. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicated no adverse effects on colony viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that clothianidin, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388567,20,06-Jul,346,364,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034257521&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388567&partnerID=40&md5=afa907f79283fc5a9db2c5fbfedb1a4e,Scopus,,,,,,0,

In this study, we investigated the effects of stereoisomeric dinotefuran on honeybee social behavior. We found that honeybees exhibit a preference for consuming food containing S-dinotefuran, actively engage in trophallaxis with S-dinotefuran‚Äìconsuming peers, and consequently acquire higher levels of S-dinotefuran compared with R-dinotefuran. In comparison to R-dinotefuran, S-dinotefuran stimulates honeybees to elevate their body temperature, thereby attracting more peers for trophallaxis. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant enrichment of thermogenesis pathways due to S-dinotefuran exposure. Additionally, metabolome data indicated that S-dinotefuran may enhance body temperature by promoting lipid synthesis in the lysine degradation pathway. Consequently, body temperature emerges as a key factor influencing honeybee social behavior. Our study is the first to highlight the propensity of S-dinotefuran to raise honeybee body temperature, which prompts honeybee to preferentially engage in trophallaxis with peers exhibiting higher body temperatures. This preference may lead honeybees to collect more dinotefuran-contaminated food in the wild, significantly accelerating dinotefuran transmission within a population. Proactive trophallaxis further amplifies the risk of neonicotinoid pesticide transmission within a population, making honeybees that have consumed S-dinotefuran particularly favored within their colonies. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the higher risk associated with neonicotinoid use compared with other pesticides. ¬© 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.pestbp.2023.105594,196,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171593234&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2023.105594&partnerID=40&md5=57ef4a690eba7dc013b00e77a4ca3ae7,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'dinotefuran', 'Dinotefuran enantiomer', 'Honeybees', 'Social behavior', 'Thermogenesis pathway', 'Transcriptomic and metabolome']",,,,,0,

While bees in the field get rarely exposed to lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids applied as seed coating, sublethal levels found in pollen and nectar may affect bee population development. We assessed a realistic and a worst-case scenario of clothianidin exposure to mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) by conducting a small-scale field and semi-field experiment at sites planted with winter oilseed rape. Flight activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were assessed at three locations. We also analysed clothianidin residues in bee-collected pollen and nectar. We detected clothianidin at low concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7¬†¬µg/kg for bumblebees and 4.7¬†¬µg/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10¬†g clothianidin/kg seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population development.

In light of the current situation, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of thiamethoxam on the development of the reproductive system and physiology in the honey bee queen. Two experimental groups of honey bee queen larvae were treated with thiamethoxam during artificial rearing, applied via artificial feed in two cycles. In the first rearing cycle, honey bee larvae received a single treatment dose (4.28¬†ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells), while the second honey bee queen rearing cycle received a double treatment dose (total of 8.56¬†ng thiamethoxam/queen larva on the 4th and 5th day after larvae grafting in artificial queen cells). After emerging, queens were anesthetized and weighed, and after mating with drones were anesthetized, weighed, and sectioned. Ovary mass and number of stored sperm were determined. Body weight differed between untreated and treated honey bee queens.

570,JOUR,Planting of neonicotinoid-coated corn raises honey bee mortality and sets back colony development,"['Samson-Robert, O.', 'Labrie, G.', 'Chagnon, M.', 'Fournier, V.']",PeerJ,"Worldwide occurrences of honey bee colony losses have raised concerns about bee health and the sustainability of pollination-dependent crops. While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments. ¬© 2017 Samson-Robert et al.",2017///,2017,10.7717/peerj.3670,2017,8,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027370657&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.3670&partnerID=40&md5=d0e9bf37441f530c8a45cca734d704db,Scopus,,,,,,0,

It is increasingly recognized, that some neonicotinoid insecticides have a negative impact on non-target organisms, including important pollinators such as the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honeybee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee viability are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide carbendazim and the herbicide glyphosate. We also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honeybee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: (i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), (ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, which are important for neuronal function.

However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./mu L) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./mu L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, environmental neurotoxic insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the larval food of queens from Plebeia droryana, a species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers. Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression) from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.048,166,,42,47,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053782196&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.09.048&partnerID=40&md5=dc45b81a935968ce1562a21945e04ef6,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Solitary bees are potentially exposed to many insecticides through contaminated pollen and/or nectar. The kinetics of these compounds in solitary bees is, however, unknown, limiting the use of these important pollinators in pesticide regulations. Here, the toxicokinetics (TK) of chlorpyrifos (as Dursban 480 EC), cypermethrin (Sherpa 100 EC), and acetamiprid (Mospilan 20 SP) was studied for the first time in Osmia bicornis females at sublethal concentrations (near LC20s). The TK of the insecticides was analysed in bees continuously exposed to insecticide-contaminated food in the uptake phase followed by feeding with clean food in the decontamination phase. The TK models differed substantially between the insecticides. Acetamiprid followed the classic one-compartment model with gradual accumulation during the uptake phase followed by depuration during the decontamination phase. Cypermethrin accumulated rapidly in the first two days and then its concentration decreased slowly. Chlorpyrifos accumulated similarly rapidly but no substantial depuration was found until the end of the experiment.

The increasing prevalence of CCD is a threat to the economic and nutritional security of all societies that rely on efficient pollination for large monoculture crops. Although there is ample evidence that Varroa mites, pesticides, disease, and climate change contribute to CCD, only a few studies have investigated the contribution of synergism across multiple factors to the development of CCD and CCD-like symptoms. However, there is increasing acknowledgement in the scientific community that synergism across different factors affects honey bee colony health and behavior.

The experimental maize crops were adjacent to the other flowering agriculture plants. Honey bee colonies were placed in three differently protected maize fields throughout the blooming period, and thereafter they were transferred to a stationary apiary. Samples of pollen loads, bee bread, and adult bees were collected and analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. To ensure high specificity and sensitivity of detection of the analyzed pesticides, a modified QuEChERS extraction method and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used. Clothianidin was detected only in the samples of pollen loads. Their residue levels ranged from 10.0 to 41.0 ng/g (average 27.0 ng/g). Imidacloprid was found in no investigated sample. No negative effects of neonicotinoid seed-treated maize on the development and long-term survival of honey bee colonies were observed. The low proportion of Zea mays pollen in total bee-collected pollen during the maize flowering period was noted. The findings suggest that maize plants are less attractive forage for honey bees than phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum Mill.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), goldenrod (Solidago L.), and vegetation from Brassicaceae family.

However, they are less studied than managed bees, mainly regarding the harmful effects of pesticides present in agroecosystems commonly visited by them. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of residual doses of imidacloprid and pyraclostrobin, alone and in combination, on the fat body (a multifunctional organ) of the neotropical solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes by means of morphological and histochemical evaluation of oenocytes and trophocytes. Males and females of newly-emerged adults were submitted to bioassays of acute topical exposure. Experimental groups were essayed: control (CTR), solvent control (ACT), imidacloprid (IMI, 0.0028 ng/ŒºL), pyraclostrobin (PYR, 2.7 ng/ŒºL) and imidacloprid + pyraclostrobin (I + P). The data demonstrated that the residual doses applied in T. diversipes adults are sublethal at 96 h. Both oenocytes and trophocytes cells responded to topical exposure to the pesticides, showing morphological changes. In the IMI group, the bee oenocytes showed the greatest proportion of vacuolization and altered nuclei. The pyraclostrobin exposure increased the intensity of PAS-positive labeling (glycogen) in trophocytes. This increase was also observed in the I + P group. Changes in energy reserve (glycogen) of trophocytes indicate a possible mobilization impairment of this neutral polysaccharide to the hemolymph, which can compromise the fitness of exposed individuals. Also, changes in oenocytes can compromise the detoxification function performed by the fat body.

563,JOUR,Short-term lab assessments and microcolonies are insufficient for the risk assessment of insecticides for bees,"['Van Oystaeyen, A.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Petit, C.', 'Lenaerts, N.', 'W√§ckers, F.']",Chemosphere,"Risk assessment studies addressing effects of agrochemicals on bumblebees frequently use microcolonies. These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128518,273,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092790597&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.128518&partnerID=40&md5=fb8a28fcd64a9319bbbfbef71f5b2696,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'Pesticide effects', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'body weight gain', 'comparative study', 'organism colony', 'reproduction', 'worker (insect)', 'laboratory', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Health', 'thiacloprid', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Bumblebees', 'evaluation study', 'Field conditions', 'Field experiment', 'fitness', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory conditions', 'Laboratory experiments', 'Male', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'Reproduction', 'Risk Assessment']",,,,,0,

In a worst-case scenario set-up the effects on adult and brood mortality of bees with special consideration of the brood development of the bees were assessed. Results: Due to the weather conditions in the first experiment guttation occurred only once, which caused a high mortality and a brood-termination rate of up to 100 % in the worst-case scenario without additional water supply but no clear increase of mortality or brood termination was observed when water was supplied. In the second experiment guttation in maize occurred on 5 of 10 days. The mortality in treated variants with water supply and control variants with untreated seeds was on a similar level and within normal range. The brood-termination rate was in the control below 16 %, in the treatment from 16 to 43 %. Conclusion: In the first experiment in the variant with treated maize and no additional water supply, an artificial and extreme situation a high impact on mortality and also on the brood development was observed, indicating the sensitivity of the test system but representing an unrealistic worst case scenario.

Here, we analysed the interacting effects of plant protection products and low nutritional pollen source on honey bee health under semi-field conditions. We established a healthy honey bee colony in each of 24 tents, planted either with monofloral maize, maize with a diverse flower strip or with monofloral Phacelia tanacetifolia. To evaluate the interaction between exposure to PPPs and nutritional status, a mixture of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide prochloraz was applied. For each colony, we investigated brood capping rate as well as adult longevity, body and head weight, and enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase of newly hatched worker bees. We found a significant reduced capping rate in treated maize compared to flowering strips and Phacelia, but no interaction effect between pesticide treatment and nutritional status on capping rate. The response to treatment on the longevity of adults differed significantly between maize and Phacelia, with flower strips being intermediate, indicating interaction effects of PPP treatment and low pollen quality in maize compared to Phacelia and flowering strip treatments. Head weight of newly hatched worker bees showed significant interaction of nutritional status and treatment of PPPs. PPPs slightly increased body weight in all nutritional statuses, except for Phacelia. Enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase showed significant different responses between maize and Phacelia to PPP exposure, but not between maize and flowering strip.

The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. ¬© 2022 Kim et al.

Sublethal impairments associated with exposure to insecticides, affecting the individual and the colony levels, have led to insecticide moratoria and bans. However, legislation alone is not sufficient and remains a temporary solution to an evolving market of insecticides. Here, we asked whether bees can be prophylactically protected against sublethal cognitive effects of two major neurotoxic insecticides, imidacloprid and fipronil, with different mechanisms of action. We evaluated the protective effect of the prophylactic administration of the flavonoid rutin, a secondary plant metabolite, present in nectar and pollen, and known for its neuroprotective properties. Following controlled or ad libitum administration of rutin, foragers of the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens received oral administration of the insecticides at sublethal realistic dosages. Learning acquisition, memory retention and decision speed were evaluated using olfactory absolute conditioning of the proboscis extension response. We show that the insecticides primarily impair acquisition but not retention or speed of the conditioned proboscis extension response. We further show that the administration of the flavonoid rutin successfully protects the bees against impairments produced by acute and chronic administration of insecticides.

To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 Œºg/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance.

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects.

Male and female individuals of O. cornuta were held in flight cages with fully blooming winter oilseed rape, treated or not with clothianidin. After hibernation, sex ratio of emerging offspring and overwintering mortality was determined. A total of 191 male and 4 female, and 203 male and 2 female O. cornuta emerged in the control and the clothianidin treatment, respectively, thereby clearly showing an extremely male-biased sex ratio. However, there was no significant clothianidin treatment effect.

However, there was no evidence that the 5 ppb dose of the pesticide impacted the ability of bees to handle flowers with different traits. Workers from colonies exposed to Sulfoxaflor were smaller. The effect on worker size may be explained as a consequence of the reduced pollen income per unit of worker foraging. Thus, if the effects of Sulfoxaflor applied directly to crops had the same effect as that observed on commercial bumble bees after our chronic exposure, it might negatively impact colony success due to the impact on pollen collection and the reduction in the size of workers.

However, honeybees are being threatened by highly effective pesticides such as neonicotinoids, which can have detrimental impacts on honeybee foraging in particular. In a colony, nectar and pollen foragers play distinct roles in sustaining the colony. Despite evidence of sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees, little is known about how neonicotinoids affect the foraging behaviour of an entire colony. Here, we conducted a field study using our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated monitoring technology to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field-realistic sub-lethal doses on colony foraging behaviour. A mechanistic simulation model (BEEHAVE) was then used to reproduce and interpret field observations, and further identify the plausible mechanisms underlying the empirical findings. Surprisingly, the field study revealed that imidacloprid greatly reduced pollen foraging but not nectar foraging. In addition, no lethal effects on honeybees were observed. The simulations showed that the time spent by pollen foragers on completing their foraging trips was significantly increased, which subsequently decreased the number of pollen foraging trips per day, thereby reducing pollen foraging at the colony level. This suggests that pollen and nectar foraging may require different energetic costs, cognitive functions, and/or gene expressions, which implies different susceptibilities of pollen and nectar foragers to chemical stressors. As pollen foraging is essential for brood rearing, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids, together with other stressors, may affect colony survival and resilience more than previously thought.",2024/06//,2024,10.1016/j.compag.2024.108966,221,,,,,,"['artificial intelligence', 'Automated monitoring', 'biomonitoring', 'Computational modelling', 'ecological impact', 'Ecology', 'Field studies', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Foraging trips', 'Gene expression', 'honeybee', 'Imidacloprids', 'Insecticides', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'numerical model', 'Oomen study', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'simulation', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects']",0168-1699,WOS:001240235200001,,,0,

This study was motivated by recent massive losses of honey bee colonies, and our objective was to examine the possible relationship between low levels of pesticide residues in apicultural matrices (honey, pollen collected by honey bees, beeswax) and colony health as measured by colony mortality and adult and brood population abundance. When all apicultural matrices were pooled together, the number of pesticide residue detected per sampling period (four sampling periods per year) and per apiary ranged from 0 to 9, with the most frequent being two (29.6%). No pesticide residues were detected during 12.7% of the sampling periods. Residues of imidacloprid and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the most frequently detected in pollen loads, honey, and honey bee matrices. Several pairs of active ingredients were present concurrently within honey bees and in pollen loads but not in beeswax and honey samples. No statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues. When pesticide residues from all matrices were pooled together, a mixed model analysis did not show a significant relationship between the presence of pesticide residues and the abundance of brood and adults, and no statistical relationship was found between colony mortality and pesticide residues. Thus, although certain pesticide residues were detected in apicultural matrices and occasionally with another pesticide residual, more work is needed to determine the role these residues play in affecting colony health. ¬© 2009 Entomological Society of America.",2009///,2009,10.1603/022.038.0302,38,3,514,523,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-68049095951&doi=10.1603%2f022.038.0302&partnerID=40&md5=d9a55020027938b6d28b16c8bcfd49da,Scopus,,,,,,0,

The term ‚Äòcaging stress‚Äô characterizes the effects of depriving honey bees of all hive aspects and conditions. Two cohorts of 1 day old sister bees were subjected to different conditions. One cohort was caged and fed different imidacloprid-tainted sugar solutions and the second was marked and introduced back to its natal hive. Physiological bee parameters and diet behavior were monitored daily for caged bees over several weeks. Bee samples from both cohorts were sampled weekly for RNA sequencing and oxidative stress analyses. Imidacloprid induced significant protein damage and post-ingestive aversion responses in caged bees, leading to lower tainted syrup consumption and higher water intake compared with the controls. No differentially expressed genes were observed among caged bees in regards to imidacloprid treatment. However, significant upregulation in antioxidant genes was recorded in caged bees as compared with hive bees, with overwhelming downregulation in all gene categories in caged bees at week 4. We identified two sets of genes that were constantly regulated in caged bees, including Rsod with unknown function in insects that could potentially characterize caging stress in honey bees. ¬© 2019.

However, these lack micronutrients present in nectar and honey, and thus may nutritionally stress colonies. Given the many stressors faced by honey bees in the environment, we evaluated how honey bees fed supplemental carbohydrates responded in combination with heat (45 ¬∞C), cold (4 ¬∞C), or imidacloprid (0.48 ng/ml) exposure. Bees were fed either honey, SS, HFCS, or HFCS + pollen and then exposed to abiotic stress treatments in the lab. Hive bee mortality was not affected by heat or cold stress, but mortality was greater for bees fed SS in imidacloprid treatments. Levels of stress proteins (superoxide dismutase (SOD), heat shock protein (HSP70), and potentially esterase) were quantified to determine sublethal stress. SOD levels were reduced in SS and HFCS treatments, indicating these diets impaired a response to oxidative stress, particularly at 45 ¬∞C. HSP70 levels were higher in the imidacloprid treatment, with no differences between control and temperature treatments. Diet interacted significantly with stress treatment with generally negative responses to HFCS. There was no effect of diet on esterase levels, though activity was much lower at 4 ¬∞C. In semifield trials, colonies with newly emerged bees fed SS experienced higher rates of worker mortality. In cage and field trials, bees consumed significantly more honey and HFCS + P than SS and HFCS. Together, these results suggest that supplemental carbohydrates contribute to sublethal stress, and natural food sources are preferred. ¬© 2018, ¬© 2018 International Bee Research Association.",2018///,2018,10.1080/00218839.2018.1494912,57,5,682,689,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054476126&doi=10.1080%2f00218839.2018.1494912&partnerID=40&md5=57fbbed4a2d48d0f9932f89ca0ae03d4,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Foragers were orally exposed to the different pesticides alone and in combination for 48 h. Bees fed with contaminated solution walked less, moved slower, presented morphological changes in the fat body, including vacuolization, altered cell shape and nuclei morphology, and exhibited a higher count of altered oenocytes and trophocytes. In all exposed groups, alone and in combination, the number of cells expressing caspase-3 increased, but the TLR4 number of cells expressing decreased compared to the control groups. The intensity of HSP70 immunolabeling increased compared to the control groups. However, the intensity of the immunolabeling of HSP90 decreased in the IMD, GLY, and I + G (IMD + GLY) groups but increased in I +P -exposed bees (IMD + PYR). Alternatively, exposure to PYR and P + G (PYR + GLY) did not affect the immunolabeling intensity.

The active ingredient imidacloprid has action on the nervous system of the insects. However, little has been studied about the actions of the insecticide on nontarget organs of insects, such as the Malpighian tubules that make up the excretory and osmoregulatory system. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid in Malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera. In the tubules of treated bees, we found an increase in the number of cells with picnotic nuclei, the lost of part of the cell into the lumen, and a homogenization of coloring cytoplasm. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolization. We confirmed the increased occurrence of picnotic nuclei by using the Feulgan reaction, which showed the chromatin compaction was more intense in the tubules of bees exposed to the insecticide. We observed an intensification of the staining of the nucleus with Xylidine Ponceau, further verifying the cytoplasmic negative regions that may indicate autophagic activity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry experiments showed TUNEL positive nuclei in exposed bees, implicating increased cell apoptosis after chronic imidacloprid exposure. In conclusion, our results indicate that very low concentrations of imidacloprid lead to cytotoxic activity in the Malpighian tubules of exposed bees at all tested times for exposure and imply that this insecticide can alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013///,2013,10.1002/jemt.22199,76,5,552,558,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875932526&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22199&partnerID=40&md5=095fa40511ee3488e63a065d4d6c8361,Scopus,,,,,,0,

We quantified concentrations of two types of systemic insecticides, neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and butenolides (flupyradifurone), in off-crop nontarget media of hummingbird cloacal fluid, honey bee (Apis mellifera) nectar and honey, and wildflowers before and after regulation of imidacloprid on highbush blueberries in Canada in April 2021. We found that mean total pesticide load increased in hummingbird cloacal fluid, nectar, and flower samples following imidacloprid regulation. On average, we did not find evidence of a decrease in imidacloprid concentrations after regulation. However, there were some decreases, some increases, and other cases with no changes in imidacloprid levels depending on the specific media, time point of sampling, and site type. At the same time, we found an overall increase in flupyradifurone, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid but no change in clothianidin concentrations. In particular, flupyradifurone concentrations observed in biota sampled near agricultural areas increased twofold in honey bee nectar, sevenfold in hummingbird cloacal fluid, and eightfold in flowers after the 2021 imidacloprid regulation. The highest residue detected was flupyradifurone at 665 ng/mL (parts per billion [ppb]) in honey bee nectar. Mean total pesticide loads were highest in honey samples (84 ¬± 10 ppb), followed by nectar (56 ¬± 7 ppb), then hummingbird cloacal fluid (1.8 ¬± 0.5 ppb), and least, flowers (0.51 ¬± 0.06 ppb).

However, if conducted appropriately their contribution is most valuable. In this paper we identify the requirements of a large-scale monitoring study for the assessment of side-effects of clothianidin seed-treated winter oilseed rape on three species of pollinating insects (Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) and present how these requirements were implemented. Two circular study sites were delineated next to each other in northeast Germany and comprised almost 65 km2 each. At the reference site, study fields were drilled with clothianidin-free OSR seeds while at the test site the oilseed rape seeds contained a coating with 10 g clothianidin and 2 g beta-cyfluthrin per kg seeds (Elado¬Æ). The comparison of environmental conditions at the study sites indicated that they are as similar as possible in terms of climate, soil, land use, history and current practice of agriculture as well as in availability of oilseed rape and non-crop bee forage. Accordingly, local environmental conditions were considered not to have had any confounding effect on the results of the monitoring of the bee species. Furthermore, the study area was found to be representative for other oilseed rape cultivation regions in Europe. ¬© 2016, The Author(s).",2016///,2016,10.1007/s10646-016-1724-9,25,9,1630,1647,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988702939&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-016-1724-9&partnerID=40&md5=cc718e7e252a3d930e9c7b8ee314f022,Scopus,,,,,,0,
569,JOUR,A field study examining the effects of exposure to neonicotinoid seed-treated corn on commercial bumble bee colonies,"['Christopher Cutler, G.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.']",Ecotoxicology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to bumble bee declines in North America and Europe. This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ‚Äúconventional‚Äù seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1‚Äì0.8¬†ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96¬†¬±¬†15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127¬†¬±¬†17 workers per hive). The results suggest that exposure during pollen shed to corn grown from neonicotinoid-treated shed poses low risk to B. impatiens. ¬© 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2014///,2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1340-5,23,9,1755,1763,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84909967566&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-014-1340-5&partnerID=40&md5=6c55c1abc68d886cfaf0a7f6c0936e33,Scopus,,,,,,0,

A growing body of research is demonstrating that, through various exposure routes, neonicotinoids can impact a suite of nontarget organisms including beneficial insects such as bees. However, to date, only a few studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoids in field settings. We assessed the relationship between agricultural crop soil neonicotinoid levels and wild bee abundance and diversity at 16 agricultural sites representing different soil neonicotinoid levels. We detected clothianidin at 11 sites, thiamethoxam at three sites; imidacloprid was not detected. Hedgerow and crop soils were consistent in terms of where clothianidin was detected; thiamethoxan was not detected in hedgerow soils. Based on model outcomes, fields with higher levels of soil neonicotinoids exhibited significantly lower wild bee abundance and diversity than those with low or no neonicotinoids detected. Crop soil neonicotinoid level, hedgerow floral resource abundance and crop type were consistent predictors of bee abundance across models; only neonicotinoid level and crop type were significant predictors of diversity. Our results are consistent with recent findings in the midwestern US, and underscore the potential risk of soil neonicotinoids to wild bee populations across regions and crop systems. ¬© 2022 The Royal Entomological Society.",2023///,2023,10.1111/afe.12530,25,1,53,65,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135518372&doi=10.1111%2fafe.12530&partnerID=40&md5=71e0e5ec5002fe41f4a756c61a1806f0,Scopus,"['neonicotinoids', 'ground-nesting bees', 'agroecosystem', 'seed coat', 'wild bee abundance', 'wild bee richness']",,,,,0,

724,JOUR,"Pesticide hazard, floral resource availability and natural enemies interactively drive the fitness of bee species depending on their crop fidelity","['Knauer, A', 'Naef, C', 'Albrecht, M']",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Pesticides, loss of floral resources and parasitism are considered drivers of wild bee decline in agroecosystems, but their interactions are poorly understood under field conditions. Negative impacts are predicted to vary across species of distinct crop fidelity because of the associated consequences for pesticide exposure and dependence on wild flowers. We experimentally established populations of two solitary bee species in apple orchards with distinct pesticide hazard and flower availability in surrounding landscapes. The number of nesting females, their reproduction and offspring survival and parasitism rate were tracked throughout apple bloom. We show that in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta, which showed a strong preference to forage in apple orchards, the number of females remaining at nesting sites towards the end of apple bloom and the overall reproductive success of the released bees declined with pesticide hazard. In contrast, the closely related Osmia bicornis, which showed a lower preference for apple, was not affected by pesticide use in orchards. Floral resource distribution furthermore modulated parasitism rates in both species: while large amounts of locally available resources reduced offspring parasitism, it increased with relatively higher food availability in the landscapes surrounding focal orchards, probably due to the bees foraging on a larger scale and thus longer periods during which nests remained unattended. Our findings provide novel insights into the complex interplay of pesticide exposure, flower availability and parasitism risk driving population dynamics of bees in agroecosystems. They show that in particular the most reliable crop pollinator species are especially harmed by high pesticide use in crops. Our study underpins the key role of reducing pesticide risks for pollinators through effective regulation of potentially hazardous agrochemicals and the promotion of alternative pest regulation approaches along with conserving and restoring flower-rich habitats to sustain pollinator populations in agroecosystems.",2024/04/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171058,922,,,,,,,0048-9697,WOS:001300718300001,,,0,

Among the main drivers of diminishing bee populations is the widespread use of agrochemicals. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the foraging dynamics of bees at agrochemical-contaminated areas, it is essential to consider both environmental conditions and the specific foraging ecology of bee species. For the first time, we conducted a semi-field study to investigate whether stingless bees exhibit a preference for food contaminated with agrochemicals compared to non- contaminated food, under natural weather conditions. Colonies of Plebeia lucii Moure, 2004 were placed in a greenhouse and subjected to a preference test, where bees were given the freedom to choose between contaminated or non-contaminated food sources following a preliminary training period. Within the greenhouse, we placed feeders containing realistic concentrations of an insecticide (acephate: 2 mg a.i./L), a herbicide (glyphosate: 31.3 mg a.i./L), or a mixture of both, alongside non- contaminated food. Environmental variables (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) were monitored throughout the experiment. At higher temperatures, the foragers preferred food containing the mixture of both agrochemicals or uncontaminated food over the other treatments. At lower temperatures, by contrast, the bees preferred food laced with a single agrochemical (acephate or glyphosate) over uncontaminated food or the agrochemical mixture. Our findings indicate that agrochemical residues in nectar pose a significant threat to P. lucii colonies, as foragers do not actively avoid contaminated food, despite the detrimental effects of acephate and glyphosate on bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even minor, natural fluctuations in environmental conditions can alter the colony exposure risk. Despite the interplay between temperature and bees' preference for contaminated food, foragers consistently collected contaminated food containing both agrochemicals, whether isolated or in combination, throughout the whole experiment.",2024/11/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175892,952,,,,,,,0048-9697,WOS:001308859900001,,,0,
783,JOUR,A demographic approach to evaluating the impact of stressors on bumble bee colonies,"['Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecological Entomology,"1. Natural and anthropogenic stressors threaten the sustainability of bumble bees and evaluating their impact is essential to the stewardship of these valuable pollinators. Demographic modelling provides a framework for testing hypotheses about the impacts of stressors, but it has not previously been applied to bumble bees. 2. I therefore formulated a demographic model for a bumble bee colony and then quantified the impact of two stressors, pesticide exposure and spider predation, by perturbing it with their known effects. 3. By simulating a laboratory exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to dietary imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide), I tested whether the observed colony decline was explained solely by a toxic effect on the fecundity of the foundress queen. By simulating field observations of B. terricola Kirby, I tested whether predation by crab spiders reduced colony fitness sufficiently to provide an adaptive explanation for avoidance behaviours seen when bumble bees encounter spiders. 4. In B. terrestris, a dose-appropriate decrease in fecundity predicted the observed colony decline, which implicates this as a principal mechanism of toxicity. In B. terricola, doubling the rate of spider predation reduced a colony's production of new queens by 11%, which implies that spider avoidance is highly adaptive. 5. These analyses illustrate the utility of demographic modelling for quantifying the impacts of stressors on bumble bees. In the future, models of this type could be used to investigate a wider range of stressors and to produce thereby knowledge and tools useful for safeguarding bumble bees and the pollination services that they provide. ¬© 2017 The Royal Entomological Society",2017///,2017,10.1111/een.12376,42,2,221,229,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010338968&doi=10.1111%2feen.12376&partnerID=40&md5=fcbfe7fdce13098497b692b2d9f99794,Scopus,,,,,,0,

32,JOUR,Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees,"['Gill, RJ', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, O', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production(1-3). Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.",2012/11/01/,2012,10.1038/nature11585,491,7422,105,U119,,,,0028-0836,WOS:000310434500039,,,0,

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013///,2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4,,,,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000346774000013,,,0,
583,JOUR,COLONY IMPACT OF PESTICIDE-INDUCED SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON HONEYBEE WORKERS: A SIMULATION STUDY USING BEEHAVE,"['Thorbek, P', 'Campbell, PJ', 'Thompson, HM']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

Considering the ecological and economic relevance of native bees, such as Scaptotrigona postica, and the insufficient studies on the effects of pesticides on their behavior and physiology, improving the current knowledge on this issue is essential. Therefore, this study investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, and glyphosate on the behavior and fat body cells of S. postica. Pesticide ingestion decreased the walking distance and mean velocity of bees compared to the control and solvent control groups. The oenocytes of the control groups were spherical, with central nuclei containing decondensed chromatin, and the trophocytes presented irregular morphology, with cells varying in shape and the cytoplasm filled with vacuoles and granules. However, bees exposed to pesticides showed extensive cytoarchitectural disruption in the fat body, such as vacuolization and shape changes in oenocytes and altered nuclei morphology in trophocytes. Moreover, pesticide exposure increased the number of atypical oenocytes and altered trophocytes, except for the PYR group, which showed a lower number of atypical oenocytes. Caspase-positive labeling significantly increased in all exposed bee groups. Alternatively, TLR4 labeling was significantly decreased in the exposed groups compared to the control groups. There was a significant increase in HSP90 immunolabeling in all exposed groups compared to the control.

Here, a purpose-built thermal‚Äìvisual arena was used in a series of pilot experiments to assess the potential impact of approximate sublethal concentrations of the next generation sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor (5 and 50 ppb) and the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid (500 ppb) and thiamethoxam (10 ppb), on the walking trajectory, navigation and learning abilities of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris audax) when subjected to an aversive conditioning task. The results suggest that only thiamethoxam prevents forager bees from improving in key training parameters (speed and distanced travelled) within the thermal visual arena. Power law analyses further revealed that a speed‚Äìcurvature power law, previously reported as being present in the walking trajectories of bumblebees, is potentially disrupted under thiamethoxam (10 ppb) exposure, but not under sulfoxaflor or thiacloprid exposure.

Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. ¬© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

706,JOUR,Impact of Chronic Exposure to Two Neonicotinoids on Honey Bee Antennal Responses to Flower Volatiles and Pheromonal Compounds,"['Favaro, R.', 'Roved, J.', 'Haase, A.', 'Angeli, S.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Volatile compounds provide important olfactory cues for honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), which are essential for their ecology, behavior, and social communication. In the external environment bees locate food sources by the use of floral scents, while inside the hive, pheromones such as the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) and alarm pheromones serve important functions in regulating colony life and inducing aggressive responses against intruders and parasites. Widely reported alterations of various behaviors in- and outside the hive following exposure to pesticides could therefore be associated with a disturbance of odor sensitivity. In the present study, we tested the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides at field concentrations on the ability of honey bees to perceive volatiles at the very periphery of the olfactory system. Bee colonies were subjected to treatments during the summer with either Imidacloprid or Thiacloprid at sublethal concentrations. Antennal responses to apple (Malus domestica L.) flower volatiles were studied by GC-coupled electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD), and a range of volatiles, a substitute of the QMP, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were tested by electroantennography (EAG). Short-term and long-term effects of the neonicotinoid treatments were investigated on bees collected in the autumn and again in the following spring. Treatment with Thiacloprid induced changes in antennal responses to specific flower VOCs, with differing short- and long-term effects. In the short term, increased antennal responses were observed for benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are common flower volatiles but also constituents of the honey bee sting gland secretions. The treatment with Thiacloprid also affected antennal responses to the QMP and the mandibular alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. In the short term, a faster signal degeneration of the response signal to the positive control citral was recorded in the antennae of bees exposed to Thiacloprid or Imidacloprid. Finally, we observed season-related differences in the antennal responses to multiple VOCs. Altogether, our results suggest that volatile-specific alterations of antennal responses may contribute to explaining several behavioral changes previously observed in neonicotinoid-exposed bees. Treatment effects were generally more prominent in the short term, suggesting that adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure may not persist across generations.

The composition of the microbial community can be used as a biological health indicator and is characterized using biomarker fatty acids. Commonly, gut microorganisms are exposed to pathogens and to an array of chemical and biological pest control methods. RESULTS: We found a strong negative effect on microbial gut community composition when exposed to the bee pest control chemicals oxytetracycline, oxalic acid and imidacloprid, and when inoculated with the bee pest Nosema spp. and the potential bee pest biocontrol agent Lactobacillus plantarum. Results from the in vitro test with bee pest chemicals showed a differential response of Lactobacillus spp. At the community level, some taxonomic groups were more affected depending on treatment, but sharp changes in the microbial structure were caused by compounds generally considered as bee safe. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pests such as Nosema spp. and pest control methods alter the composition of bee gut microorganisms, which may have severe consequences for pathogen defense, physiology and general honey bee health. In addition, L. plantarum has potential as a biocontrol agent against Nosema spp. ¬© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2018 Society of Chemical Industry",2019///,2019,10.1002/ps.5188,75,3,835,843,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054478737&doi=10.1002%2fps.5188&partnerID=40&md5=dd4c2edbf598d0c296af67429fcfeca5,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Studies have yielded contradictory results, and few have examined effects on colony development. Here we report the results of a comprehensive five-year study of the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honey bee colonies. Colonies fed 5 ng/g (ppb) imidacloprid in sugar syrup showed increased brood production, lower temperature variability, higher CO2 production and had more foragers compared to control colonies fed unadulterated syrup, but treatment did not affect adult bee numbers or average hive temperatures, and did not increase food stores, daily food acquisition or colony survivorship. These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids. Effect sizes were generally small but that could be attributed at least in part to variability in uncontrolled factors such as weather. We provide an explanation for the diverse effects of pesticide contamination on honey bees, and an improved understanding of how colonies are impacted. ¬© 2022",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113202,231,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122810885&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2022.113202&partnerID=40&md5=9f868159768d75484512cdbff9840d16,Scopus,"['animal', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'carbon dioxide', 'colony structure', 'contamination', 'controlled study', 'effect size', 'food storage', 'forager', 'Hive CO2', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'lethality', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'low temperature', 'metabolic parameters', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollinator', 'Pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population productivity', 'stimulation', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effect', 'sugar', 'survivorship', 'syrup', 'thermoregulation', 'Thermoregulation', 'weather']",,,,,0,

Imidacloprid (IMP) is a neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture for pest management control. In this study, we investigate the influence of seasonal phenotype and emerging conditions on the diet behavior of bees fed ad libitum two concentrations of IMP. We performed three independent two-choice feeding experiments using summer bees either emerged in the laboratory or in-hive and winter bees. Diet behavior post-ingestive aversion responses to IMP were investigated as well as potential affinity to the physical location and contents of the diets. Caged bees were challenged with a physical rotation of the diet‚Äôs location and their susceptibility to 5 and 20 PPB of IMP was tested. From a behavioral standpoint, our results show that winter bees expressed no affinity to the physical location of the diet but rather to its content and strongly favored IMP-tainted syrup at both 5 and 20 PPB. The opposite was recorded for na√Øve summer bees that emerged in the laboratory, which avoided the tainted syrup at both concentrations, particularly at 20 PPB. Summer bees emerged in-hive, expected to have developed a mature intestinal microbiota through trophallaxis from older bee-mates, were mainly neutral, and showed no affinity to the diet location nor its contents. Our results indicate that the physiological changes associated with seasonal phenotype and initial exposure to older mates have important consequences on the bee diet behavior toward pesticides. ¬© 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s13592-022-00922-9,53,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126201521&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-022-00922-9&partnerID=40&md5=619f04c0658dc8fd00af94b0f78457a0,Scopus,"['imidacloprid', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'concentration (composition)', 'laboratory method', 'diet', 'physiological response', 'seasonal variation', 'Diet behavior', 'Honey bee phenotypes', 'Imidacloprid toxicity', 'phenotype']",,,,,0,
773,JOUR,Modeling disruption of Apis mellifera (honey bee) odorant-binding protein function with high-affinity binders,"['Mayack, BK']",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION,"Chemical toxins pose a great threat to honey bee health because they affect memory and cognition, diminish immunity, and increase susceptibility to infection, resulting in decreased colony performance, reproduction, and survival. Although the behavioral effects of sub-lethal chemical exposure on honey bees have been intensively studied, how xenobiotics affect olfaction, at the molecular level, still needs to be elucidated. In the present work, in silico tools, such as molecular docking, binding free energy calculations, and molecular dynamics simulations are used to predict if environmental chemicals have stronger binding affinities to honey bee antennal odorant-binding protein 14 (OBP14) than the representative floral odors citralva, eugenol, and the fluorescent probe 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine. Based on structural analysis, 21 chemicals from crop pesticides, household appliances, cosmetics, food, public health-related products, and other sources, many of which are pervasive in the hive environment, have higher binding affinities than the floral odors. These results suggest that chemical exposures are likely to interfere with the honey bee's sense of smell and this disruptive mechanism may be responsible for the lower associative learning and memory based on olfaction found in bees exposed to pesticides. Moreover, bees mainly rely on olfactory cues to perceive their environment and orient themselves as well as to discriminate and identify their food, predators, nestmates, and diseased individuals that need to be removed with hygienic behavior. In summary, sub-lethal exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to colony collapse in several ways from the disruption of proper olfaction functioning.",2023/05//,2023,10.1002/jmr.3008,36,5,,,,,,0952-3499,WOS:000943001100001,,,0,
688,JOUR,Contrasting effects of Imidacloprid on habituation in 7- and 8-day-old honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Guez, D.', 'Suchail, S.', 'Gauthier, M.', 'Maleszka, R.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Neurobiology of Learning and Memory,"We examined the effects of sublethal doses (0.1, 1, and 10 ng per animal) of a new neonicotinoid insecticide, Imidacloprid, on habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees (Apis mellifera) reared under laboratory conditions. In untreated honeybees, the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex is age-dependent and there is a significant increase in the number of trials required for habituation in older bees (8-10 days old) as compared to very young bees (4-7 days old). Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4 h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of nicotinic receptors in the honeybee that have different affinities to Imidacloprid and are differentially expressed in 7- and 8-day-old individuals. ¬© 2001 Academic Press.",2001///,2001,10.1006/nlme.2000.3995,76,2,183,191,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034865712&doi=10.1006%2fnlme.2000.3995&partnerID=40&md5=a6cff1a94e1ba3c99e9917430d985061,Scopus,,,,,,0,
745,JOUR,Milkweed in agricultural field margins - A neonicotinoid exposure route for pollinators at multiple life stages,"['Naujokaitis-Lewis, I.', 'Endicott, S.', 'Gaudreault, E.', 'Maisonneuve, F.', 'Robinson, S.A.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Neonicotinoid insecticides move from targeted crops to wildflowers located in adjacent field margins, acting as a potential exposure source for wild pollinators and insect species of conservation concern, including monarch butterflies. Monarchs rely on milkweed over multiple life stages, including as a host plant for eggs and a food source for both larvae (leaves) and adults (flowers). Milkweeds, which are closely associated with field margins, can contain neonicotinoid residues, but previous assessments are constrained to a single plant tissue type. In 2017 and 2018, we sampled milkweeds from 95 field margins adjacent to crop fields (corn, soybean, hay, wheat, and barley) in agricultural landscapes of eastern Ontario, Canada. Milkweeds were sampled during the flower blooming period and leaves and flower tissues were analysed. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid were detected. Maximum concentrations in leaf samples included 10.30 ng/g of clothianidin in 2017, and 24.4 ng/g of thiamethoxam in 2018. Clothianidin and thiamethoxam percent detections in flowers (72 % and 61 %, respectively) were significantly higher than detections in leaves (24 % and 31 %, respectively). Thiamethoxam concentrations were significantly higher in paired flower samples than leaf samples (median 0.33 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g) while clothianidin concentrations also trended higher in flowers (median 0.18‚Äì0.55 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g). Only thiamethoxam showed significant differences between years, and we found no effect of crop type, with hay, soybean and corn fields all yielding 50‚Äì56 % detections in leaves. We found significantly higher concentrations in older milkweed flowers than young flowers or leaves (medians 0.87 ng/g vs <0.18 ng/g and 0.45 ng/g vs <0.07 ng/g for clothianidin and thiamethoxam, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of considering variation in milkweed tissue type and age of flowers in neonicotinoid exposure risk assessments. Efforts to increase milkweed availability in agricultural landscapes should consider how exposure to neonicotinoids can be mitigated. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175622,951,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201778006&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.175622&partnerID=40&md5=8b3cd1aa42bfc1339708ebe260e9614c,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'pesticide', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'clothianidin', 'Pesticide', 'environmental monitoring', 'flower', 'Flowers', 'larva', 'pesticide residue', 'thiamethoxam', 'Insecticide', 'landscape', 'agricultural land', 'butterfly', 'chemistry', 'Thiamethoxam', 'thiacloprid', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'limit of quantitation', 'agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'limit of detection', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'crop', 'acetonitrile', 'life cycle stage', 'Bee', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Canada', 'angiosperm', 'maize', 'rural area', 'plant leaf', 'soybean', 'wheat', 'Agricultural fields', 'species conservation', 'alfalfa', 'crop plant', 'Plant Leaves', 'deciduous plant', 'weed', 'Agricultural landscapes', 'vegetation', 'multifloral honey', 'allopurinol', 'Asclepias', 'crop rotation', 'egg', 'Field margins', 'hay', 'host plant', 'Life stages', 'milkweed', 'Milkweed', 'Monarch', 'Ontario', 'Ontario [Canada]', 'Plant diseases', 'polyethylene', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'refraction index', 'Tissue types']",,,,,0,

Regarding the honey bees, beekeepers can be hampered by decreased production of honey and other bee products. Although the effects of insecticides on bees are widely studied for obvious reasons, there is growing evidence that fungicides, too, are not harmless to bees. However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees. For this reason, we aimed to perform a histopathological diagnosis and cell death immunolabeling in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Africanized honey bee workers throughout continuous oral exposure (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h) to low concentrations of picoxystrobin (9 ppb and 18 ppb), a strobilurin fungicide. Although there were no histopathological effects on the Malpighian tubules, an organ that plays a role in excretion, these effects were observed in the midgut of bees exposed to both concentrations of picoxystrobin. Morphological alterations, as well as positive-labeling for cell death, were observed in the midgut of exposed bees over time (from 24 to 96 h after the beginning of exposure). Although the data have shown evidence of intestinal epithelial renewal in response to cytotoxic effects, i.e., recovery after short-time exposure, this organ may have its nutrient absorption functions compromised in the long-term, which may lead to symptoms of malnutrition and affect the individual's performance, which could, in turn, affect the whole colony.",2020/10/19/,2020,10.1080/00218839.2020.1724678,59,5,834,843,,,,0021-8839,WOS:000514728900001,,,0,

We analyzed the ability of walking Osmia to remember a feeding place in a small environment and found that Osmia remembers the feeding place well after 4 days of training. Uptake of field-realistic amounts of the neonicotinoid clothianidin (0.76 ng per bee) altered the animals' sensory responses to the visual environment and interfered with the retrieval of navigational memory.

Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./ŒºL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level. Therefore, interference of different cellular processes directly affects the health of M. scutellaris by compromising the function of Mt. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158086,850,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136135934&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.158086&partnerID=40&md5=035e984901e7a2b936acba69b8ca1855,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Sublethal effects', 'thiamethoxam', 'Neonicotinoid', 'stingless bee', 'sublethal dose', 'Thiamethoxam', 'gene expression', 'Cell death', 'Genes', 'animal tissue', 'LC50', 'Polymerase chain reaction', 'genetics', 'gene expression profiling', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'differential gene expression', 'Detoxification', 'Transcriptome', 'genetic analysis', 'chemical structure', 'Metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'oxidative stress', 'Transcriptomics', 'cell death', 'Malpighian tubule', 'Malpighian tubules', 'Differentially expressed gene', 'carbon', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Malpighian Tubules', 'polysaccharide', 'Carbon', 'Cellular process', 'De novo assemblies', 'De novo assembly', 'Differentially gene expressed', 'Excretion organ', 'Polysaccharides', 'Tissue regeneration']",,,,,0,
705,JOUR,Honey bee foraging ability suppressed by imidacloprid can be ameliorated by adding adenosine,"['Lin, Y.-C.', 'Lu, Y.-H.', 'Tang, C.-K.', 'Yang, E.-C.', 'Wu, Y.-L.']",Environmental Pollution,"Honey bees are important pollinators in most ecosystem, but they are currently facing many threats, which have led to a reduction in their population. Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid pesticide can impair the memory and learning ability of honey bees, which can eventually lead to a decline in their foraging and homing abilities. In this study, we investigated the homing ability barrier from the perspective of energy supply. We believe that when worker bees experience stress, their energy supply may shift from pro-movement to pro-resistance; this will lead to inadequate energy provision to the flight muscles, causing a reduction in wingbeat frequency and impairing the flight ability of the worker bees. To test this, the worker bees were treated with imidacloprid, and wing beats between the treatment groups were compared. Their glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and ATP contents were also measured, and their genes for energy metabolism and resistance were analyzed. The addition of adenosine improved the ATP content and helped recover the wingbeat frequency of the worker bees. The preliminary results obtained showed that wingbeat frequency and glucose content in the worker bees treated with imidacloprid were significantly lower than those in the control group. This result is consistent with our hypothesis and demonstrates that energy supply imbalances can prevent worker bees from returning to their hives. ¬© 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121920,332,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161702033&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.121920&partnerID=40&md5=e996b704d7601d0d98dc2e1b6f1c5c73,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal behavior', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'honeybee', 'flight', 'Food products', 'Imidacloprids', 'comparative study', 'Apidae', 'Honey bees', 'Honey bee', 'homing behavior', 'Imidacloprid', ""Workers'"", 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'experimental study', 'metabolism', 'frequency analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'physiological response', 'physiological stress', '% reductions', 'Metabolism', 'adenosine', 'Adenosine', 'adenosine triphosphate', 'Adenosine Triphosphate', 'ATP content', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'energy resource', 'Energy resources', 'Energy supplies', 'flight muscle', 'glucose', 'Glucose', 'Glucose content', 'glycogen', 'remediation', 'trehalose', 'wing', 'wingbeat frequency', 'Wingbeat frequency', 'worker bee']",,,,,0,

While these factors have been well studied individually, the experimental designs do not reflect real-world conditions where insecticide exposure and lack of forage occur simultaneously and could interactively suppress pollinator health. Using outdoor enclosures, we tested the effects of insecticides (imidacloprid + lambda-cyhalothrin) and non-crop forage (clover) in a factorial design, measuring the survival, behaviour and performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens), as well as pollination of the focal crop, watermelon. Colony survival was synergistically reduced to 17% in watermelon alone + insecticides (survival was 100% in all other treatments). However, behavioural shifts in foraging were mainly owing to insecticides (e.g. 95% reduced visitation rate to watermelon flowers), while impacts on hive performance were primarily driven by clover presence (e.g. 374% increase in the number of live eggs). Insecticide-mediated reductions in foraging decreased crop pollination (fruit set) by 32%. Altogether, these data indicate that both insecticides and non-crop forage play integral roles in shaping pollinator health in agricultural landscapes, but the relative importance and interaction of these two factors depend on which aspect of 'health' is being considered.  ¬© 2021 The Authors.",2021///,2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.0785,288,1953,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85109830790&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2021.0785&partnerID=40&md5=1e004e9d41f308859ab0f430b6b7fdd4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'flower', 'Flowers', 'forage', 'herbicide', 'agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'Bombus impatiens', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'fruit', 'Fruit', 'agroecosystem', 'pollinator health', 'Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus', 'crop pollination', 'food supplementation', 'Trifolium']",,,,,0,

Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application. Our findings demonstrate a neuronal mechanism that may account for the cognitive impairments caused by neonicotinoids, and predict that exposure to multiple pesticides that target cholinergic signalling will cause enhanced toxicity to pollinators.",2013/03//,2013,10.1038/ncomms2648,4,,,,,,,2041-1723,WOS:000318873900087,,,0,
571,JOUR,Bumblebees are resilient to neonicotinoid-fungicide combinations,"['Schuhmann, A.', 'Schulte, J.', 'Feldhaar, H.', 'Scheiner, R.']",Environment International,"Bumblebees are among the most important wild bees for pollination of crops and securing wildflower diversity. However, their abundance and diversity have been on a steady decrease in the last decades. One of the most important factors leading to their decline is the frequent use of plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture, which spread into forests and natural reserves. Mixtures of different PPPs pose a particular threat because of possible synergistic effects. While there is a comparatively large body of studies on the effects of PPPs on honeybees, we still lack data on wild bees. We here investigated the influence of the frequent fungicide Cantus¬Æ Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan¬Æ (acetamiprid) and their combination on bumblebees. Cognitive performance and foraging flights of bumblebees were studied. They are essential for the provisioning and survival of the colony. We introduce a novel method for testing four treatments simultaneously on the same colony, minimizing inter-colony differences. For this, we successfully quartered the colony and moved the queen daily between compartments. Bumblebees appeared astonishingly resilient to the PPPs tested or they have developed mechanisms for detoxification. Neither learning capacity nor flight activity were inhibited by treatment with the single PPPs or their combination. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108608,186,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189564332&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2024.108608&partnerID=40&md5=9fc756abf41a340efaed788ab5e021fe,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'foraging behavior', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'pesticide', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'learning', 'physiology', 'foraging', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'flight', 'Insecticide', 'mortality', 'cognition', 'bumblebee', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'fungicide', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Synergistic effect', 'agriculture', 'Fungicides', '2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'dimoxystrobin', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'synergism', 'Plant protection products', 'boscalid', 'Fungicide', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'biphenyl derivative', 'catering service', 'Cognitive performance', 'color preference test', 'forest', 'Forest reserves', 'Forestry', 'Natural reserves', 'Niacinamide', 'nicotinamide', 'Novel methods', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'pesticide resistance', 'plant protection product', 'Synergistic effects', 'Wild bee', 'Wild bees']",,,,,0,
604,JOUR,Immune related gene expression in worker honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) pupae exposed to neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor),"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Cizelj, I.', 'Zorc, M.', 'ƒåitar, M.', 'Bo≈æiƒç, J.', 'Glavan, G.', 'Narat, M.']",PLoS ONE,"Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. ¬© 2017 Tesovnik et al.

43,JOUR,Neonicotinoid pesticide exposure impairs crop pollination services provided by bumblebees,"['Stanley, DA', 'Garratt, MPD', 'Wickens, JB', 'Wickens, VJ', 'Potts, SG', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Recent concern over global pollinator declines has led to considerable research on the effects of pesticides on bees(1-5). Although pesticides are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5). Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and the functioning of natural ecosystems.",2015/12/24/,2015,10.1038/nature16167,528,7583,548,+,,,,0028-0836,WOS:000366991900051,,,0,
12,JOUR,Hazards of imidacloprid seed coating to Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) when applied to sunflower,"['Tasei, JN', 'Ripault, G', 'Rivault, E']",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,"Seed coating treatments of sunflower by the systemic insecticide imidacloprid was suspected of affecting honey bees and bumblebees. The hypothesis raised was whether imidacloprid could migrate into nectar and pollen, then modify Rower attractiveness, homing behavior, and colony development. Our greenhouse and field experiments with Bombus terrestris L. were aimed at the following: the behavior of workers foraging on treated and control plants blooming in a greenhouse, the homing rate of colonies placed for 9 d in a treated field compared with colonies in a control field, and the development of these 20 colonies under laboratory conditions when removed from the fields. In the greenhouse, workers visited blooming heads of treated and control plants at the same rate and the mean duration of their visits was similar. In field colonies, analysis of pollen in hairs and pellets of workers showed that in both fields 98% of nectar foragers visited exclusively sunflowers, whereas only 25% of pollen gatherers collected sunflower pollen. After 9 d, in the control and treated field, 23 and 33% of the marked foragers, respectively, did not return to hives. In both fields, workers significantly drifted from the center to the sides of colony rows. During the 26-d period under field and laboratory conditions, the population increase rate of the 20 colonies was 3.3 and 3.0 workers/ d in hives of the control and treated field, respectively. This difference was not significant. New queens were produced in eight colonies in either field. The mean number of new queens per hive was 17 and 24 in the control and treated field, respectively. Their mating rate was the same. It was concluded that applying imidacloprid at the registered dose, as a seed coating of sunflowers cultivated in greenhouse or in field, did not significantly affect the foraging and homing behavior of B. terrestris and its colony development.",2001/06//,2001,10.1603/0022-0493-94.3.623,94,3,623,627,,,,0022-0493,WOS:000169234700004,,,0,

Its flowers constitute important sources for bees and beekeepers take advantage of this and keep their honey bee colonies within or near the plantations for honey production. Nonetheless, these plantations are susceptible to pests, such as the eucalyptus weevil Gonipterus platensis. To control this weevil, some plantations must be treated with pesticides, which might harm non-target organisms. This study aimed to perform a multifactorial assessment of the health status and development of Apis mellifera iberiensis colonies in two similar landscape windows dominated by Eucalyptus globulus plantations - one used as control and the other with insecticide treatment. In each of the two selected areas, an apiary with five hives was installed and monitored before and after a single application of the insecticide acetamiprid (40 g a.i./ha). Colony health and development, resources use, and pesticide residues accumulation were measured. The results showed that the application of acetamiprid in this area did not alter the health status and development of the colonies. This can be explained by the low levels of residues of acetamiprid detected only in pollen and bee bread samples, ~52 fold lower than the sublethal effect threshold. This could be attributed to the low offer of resources during and after the application event and within the application area, with the consequent foraging outside the sprayed area during that period. Since exposure to pesticides in such complex landscapes seems to be dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of resources, we highlight some key monitoring parameters and tools that are able to provide reliable information on colony development and use of resources. These tools can be easily applied and can provide a better decision-taking of pesticide application in intensive production systems to decrease the risk of exposure for honey bees. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157030,844,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133702532&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.157030&partnerID=40&md5=ed6ae1e835fcbede6033369b95c264c8,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pest control', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'environmental monitoring', 'foraging', 'Food products', 'pesticide residue', 'organism colony', 'landscape', 'Honey bee', 'Health', 'nontarget organism', 'pesticide application', 'bioaccumulation', 'decision making', 'Eucalyptus', 'Apis mellifera iberiensis', 'Eucalyptus globulus', 'Field exposure', 'Health status', 'Landscape management', 'monoculture', 'Monoculture plantations', 'plantation', 'Portugal']",,,,,0,

We hypothesized that octopamine (OA), with important functions in reward signaling and learning, can improve the behavior of honey bees under chemical stress. Memory retention and sucrose responsiveness were evaluated using the proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay. The one-day-old bees were exposed separately to diazinon, imidacloprid, paraquat, manganese, and thymol at concentrations of 0.22, 29.04, 55.69, 106.19, and 0.91 ppm, respectively. On the 21st day of exposure, the bees‚Äô responses to memory retention and sucrose responsiveness experiments were recorded after the training trial. In addition, PERs were recorded after OA injection. During the intervals, honey bees were exposed to the toxins topically. The expression levels of OA receptor genes, AmoctŒ±R1 and AmoctŒ≤R4, were measured. The sucrose responsiveness tests showed no significant differences between the bees stimulated with the control solutions or toxins. Moreover, our results indicated that memory retention significantly declined in honey bees exposed to toxins compared to the controls (P‚â§0.05). According to the findings, OA improved the memory retention of honey bees exposed to toxins (P‚â§0.05). The expression levels of AmoctŒ±R1 and AmoctŒ≤R4 genes significantly increased in the treated honey bees, especially those exposed to paraquat and manganese, after 30 min post-OA injection.

819,JOUR,Bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens prefer pesticide-contaminated soils when selecting underground hibernation sites,"['Rondeau, S.', 'Raine, N.E.']",Science of the Total Environment,"New evidence points to substantial impacts of exposure to pesticide residues in soil for a range of bee taxa that have close regular contact with this substrate. Among others, the risk of exposure is high for bumblebee (Bombus spp.) queens hibernating in agricultural soils. An important question is whether bumblebee queens can detect and avoid pesticide-contaminated soils, or whether they might be attracted to such agrochemical residues. To address this question, we performed a multiple-choice preference experiment in which newly emerged bumblebee (Bombus impatiens) queens were given access to arrays of 36 crates of soil treated with different pesticides in large mesh-covered enclosures. Five of the most commonly encountered pesticides in agricultural soils (boscalid, chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, cyantraniliprole, difenoconazole) were selected for testing at two contamination levels (lower or higher), based on field-realistic exposure estimates. Bumblebee queens consistently avoided hibernating in pesticide-free soil at both contamination levels, while showing no avoidance for any pesticide-treated soil types. At the lower contamination level, queens selected the pesticide-free soil 1.3 to 2.4-fold less frequently on average than any of the spiked soils, while none of the queens from the higher contamination group selected pesticide-free soil. This apparent preference for pesticide-contaminated soils increases the likelihood of exposure to and potential hazard from pesticide residues in soil for bumblebee queens during hibernation, a critical and highly vulnerable period of their annual life cycle. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176534,954,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205338389&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.176534&partnerID=40&md5=79a36f4ceb1353b863a14c6e8815a1f7,Scopus,"['bee', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'clothianidin', 'Pesticide effects', 'pesticide residue', 'landscape', 'agricultural land', 'environmental factor', 'temperature', 'bumblebee', 'pollution effect', 'behavioral response', 'preference behavior', 'overwintering', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'difenoconazole', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides exposures', 'avoidance behavior', 'Soil pollution', 'maximum concentration', 'vulnerability', 'life cycle', 'Bumble bee', 'soil pollution', 'Preference', 'hibernation', 'agricultural soil', 'Avoidance', 'Anthropogenic', 'Behavioral effects', 'Behavioural effect', 'Ecological trap', 'Multiple choice', 'Multiple-choice preference', 'Overwintering', 'Solidago', 'substrate']",,,,,0,

These factors have been found to have strong and often interacting negative effects on multiple pollinator species in laboratory based studies, however their interactions in the field are less clear. To try and understand the link between pesticide use on pollinator communities, and how this might impact on disease transmission, we took two complementary approaches. First, we undertook a series of pollinator surveys to assess the abundance and diversity of pollinator groups across British agricultural field sites subject to varying levels of pesticide use. We then screened the offspring of two taxa of tube nesting solitary bees (Osmiabicomis and Megachile spp.) for three parasite groups commonly associated with pollinators. We found lower pollinator abundance, group richness and diversity across agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use. Specifically, there were fewer honey bees, hoverflies, solitary bees and wasps. Surprisingly, we found a lower prevalence of all three parasite groups in O. bicomis offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. We also found a lower prevalence of Ascosphaera but a higher prevalence of Microsporidia in Megachile offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared to lower pesticide use. Together, our results suggest that agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use may be affecting pollinators indirectly by disrupting community structure and influencing disease epidemiology and vectoring opportunities. This highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between pesticide use and disease in both managed and wild bee populations for the future mitigation of pollinator declines.",2018/04/15/,2018,10.1016/j.agee.2018.02.002,258,,40,48,,,,0167-8809,WOS:000429394600005,,,0,

Changes in the immune response may hinder insects more susceptible to diseases and increase the risk of pathogen infection and pest resistance. We found that imidacloprid and amitraz alter the oxidative response of insect hemocytes at different concentrations of the immune stimulator, zymosan A. There is a differential effect of imidacloprid and amitraz on hemocytes of insects from different orders and their effect on oxidative response in insects persists beyond the point of early contact with zymosan A. Invertebrates have a diverse immune system that responds differently to stressors such as pesticides and pathogens, which leads to different degrees of susceptibility. Honeybees are facing a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder which is attributed to several factors including pesticides and pathogens. We applied an in vitro approach to assess the response of immune-activated hemocytes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Mamestra brassicae after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz. Hemocytes were exposed to the pesticides in single and co-exposures using zymosan A for immune activation. We measured the effect of these exposures on cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production from 15 to 120 min and on extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production after 3 h to assess potential alterations in the oxidative response. Our results indicate that NO and H2O2 production is more altered in honeybee hemocytes compared to D. melanogaster and M. brassicae cell lines. There is also a differential production at different time points after pesticide exposure between these insect species as contrasting effects were evident with the oxidative responses in hemocytes. The results imply that imidacloprid and amitraz act differently on the immune response among insect orders and may render honeybee colonies more susceptible to infection and pests.",2023/02//,2023,10.3390/insects14020174,14,2,,,,,"['neonicotinoids', 'pesticides', 'insects', 'humoral response', 'inflammatory response', 'invertebrate immunity']",2075-4450,WOS:000939059500001,,,0,

Molecular mass profiling by MALDI BeeTyping((R)) was used on bee haemolymph to explore the signature of pesticidal and parasitic stressor impacts. This approach was complemented by bottom-up proteomics to investigate the modulation of the haemoproteome. We tested acute oral doses of three pesticides-glyphosate, Amistar and sulfoxaflor-on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, alongside the gut parasite Crithidia bombi. We found no impact of any pesticide on parasite intensity and no impact of sulfoxaflor or glyphosate on survival or weight change. Amistar caused weight loss and 19-41% mortality. Haemoproteome analysis showed various protein dysregulations. The major pathways dysregulated were those involved in insect defences and immune responses, with Amistar having the strongest impact on these dysregulated pathways. Our results show that even when no response can be seen at a whole organism level, MALDI BeeTyping((R)) can detect effects.

TMX and other neonicotinoids are reported to be potential causes of honey bee decline. Due to its systematic action, TMX may be recovered in pollen, bee bread, nectar, and honey, which make bees likely to be exposed to contaminated diet. In this study, we used immunolabeling to demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of TMX decrease the protein levels of synapsin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the antennal lobes (ALs) of pupae and newly emerged worker bees that were exposed through the food to TMX during the larval phase. A decrease in the synapsin level was observed in the MBs of pupae previously exposed to 0.001 and 1.44 ng/¬µL and in newly emerged bees previously exposed to 1.44 ng/¬µL and no changes were observed in the optical lobes (OLs). In the ALs, the decrease was observed in pupae and newly emerged bees exposed to 1.44 ng/¬µL. Because the MBs and ALs are brain structures involved in stimuli reception, learning, and memory consolidation and because synapsin is important for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we hypothesize that exposure to sublethal concentrations of TMX during the larval stage may cause neurophysiological disorders in honey bees. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.048,169,,523,528,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056819414&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.11.048&partnerID=40&md5=b2de92bf068a1cbab18fb4514594a35a,Scopus,,,,,,0,

679,JOUR,Imidacloprid-induced facilitation of the proboscis extension reflex habituation in the honeybee,"['Lambin, M.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Raymond, S.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology,"Imidacloprid is a new insecticide from the family of the neonicotinoids, which interact with the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The effects of imidacloprid at a dose that does not affect sensory or motor functions are studied on non-associative learning abilities in the honeybee. The behavioral procedure is the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Imidacloprid topically applied on the thorax (1 Œºl) at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee induces an increase of the gustatory threshold defined as the lowest concentration of a sucrose solution applied to the antennae able to elicit the PER. The ability of the honeybee to move in an open-field-like apparatus is impaired at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee. These effects are amplified with time and reach a maximum 60 min after application. The lowest dose of 1.25 ng/bee has no effect on the gustatory function but increases the motor activity and facilitates the PER habituation independently of time. This result fits our hypothesis that a slight activation of the cholinergic system with a low dose of imidacloprid can facilitate a simple form of learning in the honeybee. Arch. Insect Biochem.

In recent years a dramatic decline of pollinators has been reported in many countries. The drivers of this declines appear to be associated with pathogen infections like viruses, bacteria or fungi in combination with pesticide exposure. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the impact of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, on the cellular immune response of two pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) during simultaneous immune activation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of Escherichia coli. For this purpose the phagocytosis capacity as well as the production of H2O2 and NO of larval hemocytes, exposed to five different imidacloprid concentrations in vitro, was measured. All used pesticide concentrations showed a weakening effect on phagocytosis with but also without LPS activation. Imidacloprid decreased H2O2 and increased NO production in honeybees. Immune activation by LPS clearly reinforced the effect of imidacloprid on the immune response of hemocytes in all three immune parameters tested. Bumblebee hemocytes appeared more sensitive to imidacloprid during phagocytosis assays while imidacloprid showed a greater impact on honeybee hemocytes during H2O2 and NO production.",2018/07//,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.05.002,108,,17,24,,,,0022-1910,WOS:000436217700003,,,0,

Fruits cannot be grown commercially without the use of crop protection agents, either from organic or chemical origin. The use of products with toxic effects is banned during flowering, and precise pre-flowering intervals have to be respected in Good Agricultural Practice. Bee pollination is essential for fruit crops to guarantee maximal fruit quality (shape and size) and quantity (yield weight). Fruit growers in Belgium depend mostly on non-commercial beekeepers to provide sufficient colonies for adequate pollination. Under optimal circumstances, beekeepers and fruit growers have mutual benefits from this cooperation as both honey and fruit yield increase. In those European countries with a monitoring scheme, acute bee poisoning incidents have decreased considerably and hardly cause problems at present. In recent years, some concerns arose around sublethal effects (i.e., behavioural changes) of chemical crop protection on bees, especially with regard to increased winter mortality. Even though short-term effects can indeed be induced in individually exposed bees, studies that exposed complete colonies did not reveal any long-term consequences at colony level. However, from the fruit growers' viewpoint, potential short-term effects on foraging behaviour are relevant as they can bear on pollination efficacy.",2008///,2008,,73,3,405,408,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-65249159254&partnerID=40&md5=1675aa49336ec39e307463c58a01bd09,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Nuclei enclosing one-fourth Dadant frame, are made with Plexiglas sides allowing a complete observation of the insects. After the nuclei are filled with pollen, brood and 1,000 adult bees, foraging bees are trained to visit a feeding station placed at the center of the tunnel, which means a 10 m distance from the entrance of the nuclei. The day-time of the disposal of the sugar solution is to be strictly regarded. When the foragers are well trained to forage a sucrose solution, a contaminated one is offered the following days. Criteria of observation can be (i) the foragers recruitment, (ii) the number of feeding bees and their behaviour at the feeder, (iii) the return flights, (iv) the trophallaxis inside the nucleus. Such a protocol has been put into practice to demonstrate the alteration of the homing flight in bees exposed to sublethal doses of deltamethrin (Vandame et al., 1995).

47,JOUR,Bumblebees Exposed to a Neonicotinoid Pesticide Make Suboptimal Foraging Decisions,"['Siviter, H.', 'Johnson, A.K.', 'Muth, F.']",Environmental Entomology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers, but many species are in decline. Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide globally and can have negative sublethal effects on bumblebee colony growth and reproduction. Individual bumblebees can visit hundreds to thousands of flowers a day to forage for their colony. As such, they are a model species for studying optimal foraging, and small impairments to an individual's foraging decisions may have compounding effects on the colony's nutritional intake. We exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, before allowing them to forage on an artificial floral array. We found that neonicotinoid-exposed bumblebees made suboptimal foraging decisions, as they were more likely to visit flowers located further apart than control bees. This indicates that for a given flower patch, individual bees exposed to a neonicotinoid will likely use more energy and forage less efficiency than unexposed bees, although further studies that directly measure energetic cost are required to confirm this. Given the robust and growing body of evidence demonstrating negative sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees, sublethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory within the regulatory process.  ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

809,JOUR,Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica,"['Syama, P.S.', 'Sreeranjit Kumar, C.V.']",Sociobiology,"Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. ¬© 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings.

Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies. Larvae that had been fed either the pesticide or LPS were removed at a significantly higher rate than control larvae. Our results demonstrate that larvae exposed to clothianidin possess altered CHC profiles, are detected in the colony by nurse bees via chemical cues and are actively removed.",2021/12/25/,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113020,228,,,,,,"['Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'environmental exposure', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'larva', 'organism colony', 'sublethal concentration', 'metabolism', 'behavioral response', 'Honeybee larvae', 'mass spectrometry', 'oenocyte', 'dimethoate', 'mass fragmentography', 'chemical communication', 'cell count', 'brooding (eggs)', 'cell function', 'Chemical communication', 'cuticle', 'Cuticular hydrocarbons', 'gas chromatography', 'hydrocarbon', 'Hygienic behavior', 'insect cell', 'larval removal behavior', 'lipopolysaccharide', 'nonverbal communication', 'pollutant removal', 'Sublethal pesticide doses']",0147-6513,WOS:000740121400007,,,0,
721,JOUR,In situ replication of honey bee colony collapse disorder,"['Lu, C.', 'Warchol, K.M.', 'Callahan, R.A.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The concern of persistent loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies worldwide since 2006, a phenomenon referred to as colony collapse disorder (CCD), has led us to investigate the role of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in the emergence of CCD. CCD is commonly characterized by the sudden disappearance of honey bees (specifically worker bees) from hives containing adequate food and various stages of brood in abandoned colonies that are not occupied by honey bees from other colonies. This in situ study was designed to replicate CCD based on a plausible mechanistic hypothesis in which the occurrence of CCD since 2006 was resulted from the presence of imidacloprid, one of the neonicotinoid insecticides, in high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), fed to honey bees as an alternative to sucrose-based food. We used a replicated split-plot design consisting of 4 independent apiary sites. Each apiary consisted of 4 different imidacloprid-treated hives and a control hive. The dosages used in this study were determined to reflect imidacloprid residue levels reported in the environment previously. All hives had no diseases of symptoms of parasitism during the 13-week dosing regime, and were alive 12 weeks afterward. However, 15 of 16 imidacloprid-treated hives (94%) were dead across 4 apiaries 23 weeks post imidacloprid dosing. Dead hives were remarkably empty except for stores of food and some pollen left, a resemblance of CCD. Data from this in situ study provide convincing evidence that exposure to sub-lethal levels of imidacloprid in HFCS causes honey bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks post imida-cloprid dosing. The survival of the control hives managed alongside with the pesticide-treated hives unequivocally augments this conclusion. The observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.",2012///,2012,,65,1,99,106,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84860796152&partnerID=40&md5=f9c9b22ffdc45b009d4ace2a4ad99f64,Scopus,,,,,,0,
822,JOUR,Assessing Insecticide Hazard to Bumble Bees Foraging on Flowering Weeds in Treated Lawns,"['Larson, J.L.', 'Redmond, C.T.', 'Potter, D.A.']",PLoS ONE,"Maintaining bee-friendly habitats in cities and suburbs can help conserve the vital pollination services of declining bee populations. Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants, neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees, but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated. After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days, and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop. Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly contaminated by spray residues contained 171¬±44 ppb clothianidin. Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears non-hazardous to bumble bees. ¬© 2013 Larson et al.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0066375,8,6,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878950172&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0066375&partnerID=40&md5=511c3eab7690065851b8a5dc26bb8eea,Scopus,,,,,,0,
632,JOUR,"A common neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, alters honey bee activity, motor functions, and movement to light","['Tosi, S.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Scientific Reports,"Honey bees provide key ecosystem services. To pollinate and to sustain the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour. However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus, TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and, potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain outdoors. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15308-6,7,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033712581&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-017-15308-6&partnerID=40&md5=3f5ad3c593852af728b730e1444a9003,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

Understanding how these factors affect crop pollinator communities is crucial to inform practices that generate optimal pollination and ensure sustainable food production. In this study, we investigated the effects of landscape composition and pesticide residues on bee communities and their pollination services in Solanum quitoense Lam. ""lulo"" crops in Colombia. On 10 farms, located along a gradient of land use change that varied from 0.15 to 0.62 in their natural habitat proportion, we characterized the bee community visiting the crop, and carried out pollination experiments with bagged and open inflorescences to later estimate fruit set, weight, and diameter at every site. Additionally, we performed pesticide analysis on collected anthers through liquid chromatography to estimate pesticide risk coming from the crop fields using hazard quotients (HQ). Bee abundance and species richness decreased with increased HQ, but these negative pesticide effects were less detrimental in farms with higher natural habitat proportions. However, this buffer effect was lost at sites with very high HQs. Imidacloprid was frequently found in the anthers and there were extremely high concentrations in some farms (0.6 to 13,063 mu g/kg), representing the molecule of greatest risk for bees in this context. Pollinator's importance to crop yield was demonstrated in the exclusion experiments, where we found a reduction in fruit set (51%), weight (39%), and diameter (25%). We found a significant effect of bee richness on fruit set, while landscape composition and HQ had no significant effect on fruit set, suggesting that the last two factors do not affect yield directly, but indirectly through a decrease in pollinator diversity. Our results provide novel evidence that natural habitat loss due to the expansion of pastures for cattle ranching and pesticide residues in anthers reduce bee diversity and abundance in this Andean cropping system, but strategies to protect and restore natural habitat can help to buffer, until certain levels, these negative effects.",2021/08//,2021,10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e01668,28,,,,,,"['Imidacloprid', 'Ecosystem services', 'Bee pollination', 'Landscape simplification', 'Lulo', 'Naranjilla', 'Solanum quitoense']",2351-9894,WOS:000683779400008,,,0,

The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies. Therefore, our findings highlight the need to further study how ubiquitous stressors like V. destructor and neonicotinoids interact to affect honey bees. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137535,313,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144613712&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.137535&partnerID=40&md5=a31e7a9ca2d4e9ea94142b689c6df604,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pollution exposure', 'Apis mellifera', 'feeding behavior', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'adult', 'honey', 'Honey bee', 'mite', 'Varroa destructor', 'Varroidae', 'body mass', ""Workers'"", 'Parasite-', 'emergence', 'host parasite interaction', 'Mites', 'Honey', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Abiotic', 'abiotic factor', 'antagonism', 'Antagonism', 'antagonistic effect', 'Biotic', 'Biotics', 'ectoparasite', 'Hypopharyngeal gland', 'Hypopharyngeal glands', 'hypopharynx', 'inclusive fitness', 'organ size', 'Parasite', 'parasite survival', 'parasitism', 'Stressor interaction', 'Stressor interactions']",,,,,0,

Abrasion of the seed coating generates insecticide-laden planter dust that disperses through the landscape during corn planting and has resulted in many ‚Äúbee-kill‚Äù incidents in North America and Europe. We investigated the linkage between corn planting and honey bee colony success in a region dominated by corn agriculture. Over 3 yr we consistently observed an increased presence of corn seed treatment insecticides in bee-collected pollen and elevated worker bee mortality during corn planting. Residues of seed treatment neonicotinoids, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, detected in pollen positively correlated with cornfield area surrounding the apiaries. Elevated worker mortality was also observed in experimental colonies fed field-collected pollen containing known concentrations of corn seed treatment insecticides. We monitored colony growth throughout the subsequent year in 2015 and found that colonies exposed to higher insecticide concentrations exhibited slower population growth during the month of corn planting but demonstrated more rapid growth in the month following, though this difference may be related to forage availability.

One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018///,2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1883-3,27,2,175,187,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038868257&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-017-1883-3&partnerID=40&md5=bd9b6a48434b0c0aee93fbb0f6728b07,Scopus,,,,,,0,

Lotmaria passim, a ubiquitous unicellular parasite in honey bees, is considered harmful under specific conditions. Imidacloprid causes unpredictable side effects. Research indicates that both L. passim and imidacloprid may affect the physiology, behavior, immunity, microbiome and lifespan of honey bees. We designed cage experiments to test whether the infection of L. passim is affected by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. Workers collected at the time of emergence were exposed to L. passim and 2.5 Œºg/L imidacloprid in the coexposure treatment group. First, samples of bees were taken from cages since they were 5 days old and 3 days postinfection, i.e., after finishing an artificial 24 h L. passim infection. Additional bees were collected every two additional days. In addition, bees frozen at the time of emergence and collected from the unexposed group were analyzed. Abdomens were analyzed using qPCR to determine parasite load, while corresponding selected heads were subjected to a label-free proteomic analysis. Our results show that bees are free of L. passim at the time of emergence. Furthermore, imidacloprid considerably increased the prevalence as well as parasite loads in individual bees. This means that imidacloprid facilitates infection, enabling faster parasite spread in a colony and potentially to surrounding colonies. The proteomic analysis of bee heads showed that imidacloprid neutralized the increased transferrin 1 expression by L. passim. Importantly, this promising marker has been previously observed to be upregulated by infections, including gut parasites. This study contributes to understanding the side effects of imidacloprid and demonstrates that a single xenobiotic/pesticide compound can interact with the gut parasite.

By testing the effects of six metabolites of imidacloprid, we show that two of them, olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, modify the number of trials needed to habituate the PER in a contrasting manner. Olefin increases the number of trials in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid decreases the number of trials, but only in 8-day-old individuals. We conclude that olefin and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid are specific agonists of two subtypes of an nAChR that are differentially expressed during adult maturation of young honeybees. Olefin is the agonist of an nAChR expressed in both age groups, whereas 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid is the agonist of a late-onset nAChR that is activated in 8-day-old bees. The implications of this finding for the honeybee biology are discussed. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

612,JOUR,Potential acetylcholine-based communication in honeybee haemocytes and its modulation by a neonicotinoid insecticide,"['Pamminger, T', 'Basley, K', 'Goulson, D', 'Hughes, WOH']",PEERJ,"There is growing concern that some managed and wild insect pollinator populations are in decline, potentially threatening biodiversity and sustainable food production on a global scale. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that sub-lethal exposure to neurotoxic, neonicotinoid pesticides can negatively affect pollinator immunocompetence and could amplify the effects of diseases, likely contributing to pollinator declines. However, a direct pathway connecting neonicotinoids and immune functions remains elusive. In this study we show that haemocytes and non-neural tissues of the honeybee Apis mellifera express the building blocks of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are the target of neonicotinoids. In addition, we demonstrate that the haemocytes, which form the cellular arm of the innate immune system, actively express choline acetyltransferase, a key enzyme necessary to synthesize acetylcholine. In a last step, we show that the expression of this key enzyme is affected by field-realistic doses of clothianidin, a widely used neonicotinoid. These results support a potential mechanistic framework to explain the effects of sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoids on the immune function of pollinators.",2024/09/13/,2024,10.7717/peerj.17978,12,,,,,,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'honeybee', 'Pesticide', 'nicotinic receptor', 'Neonicotinoid', 'gene expression', 'LD50', 'acetylcholine', 'RNA extraction', 'hemolymph', 'Clothianidin', 'biodiversity', 'fat pad', 'innate immunity', 'Bee health', 'blood cell', 'choline acetyltransferase', 'food industry', 'Haemocytes', 'Immune regulation', 'Immunosuppression', 'Innate immune system', 'randomized controlled trial']",2167-8359,WOS:001316501400005,,,0,

They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death.

We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers.

In recent years, this balance has been disrupted greatly by some pesticides, which results in great losses of honeybees worldwide. Previous studies have found that pesticide-caused memory loss might be one of the major reasons for colony loss. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are chemical compounds that inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases and are known to cause hyperacetylation of histone cores and influence gene expression. In our study, the HDACi sodium butyrate was applied to honeybees as a dietary supplement. The effect of sodium butyrate on the expression profiles of memory-related genes was analysed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results revealed that this HDACi had up-regulation effects on most of the memory-related genes in bees, even in bees treated with imidacloprid. In addition, using the proboscis extension reflex to evaluate olfactory learning in bees, we found that this HDACi boosted the memory formation of bees after impairment owing to imidacloprid exposure. This study investigated the association between gene expression and memory formation from an epigenetic perspective. Additionally, we further demonstrate the possibility of enhancing bee learning using HDACis and provide initial data for future research.",2018/08//,2018,10.1111/imb.12390,27,4,512,521,,,,0962-1075,WOS:000439998400008,,,0,
38,JOUR,Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure,"['Gill, RJ', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""fec12292-list-0001""> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",2014/12//,2014,10.1111/1365-2435.12292,28,6,1459,1471,,,,0269-8463,WOS:000344592000015,,,0,

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

The apiaries were selected using spatially stratified random sampling. Colony winter loss data were collected and related to various measures of colony strength recorded in summer, as well as data from laboratory analysis of sample material taken from two selected colonies in each of the 43 apiaries. The logistic regression model which best explained the risk of winter loss included, in order of statistical importance, the variables (1) Varroa destructor mite infestation rate in October 2011, (2) presence of the cyano-substituted neonicotinoids acetamiprid or thiacloprid in the first 2 weeks of August 2011 in at least one of the honey bee matrices honey, bees or bee bread (pollen), (3) presence of Brassica napus (oilseed rape) or Sinapis arvensis (wild mustard) pollen in bee bread in early August 2011, and (4) a measure of the unexplained winter losses for the postal code area where the colonies were located, obtained from a different dataset. We consider in the discussion that reduced opportunities for foraging in July and August because of bad weather may have added substantially to the adverse effects of acetamiprid and thiacloprid. A novel feature of this work is its use of postal code random effects from two other independent datasets collected in the annual national monitoring by questionnaires of winter losses of honey bees in the Netherlands. These were used to plan the sample selection and also in the model fitting of the data in this study. It should however be noted that the results of the present pilot study are based on limited data, which may consequently reveal strong factors but fail to demonstrate possible interaction effects.

34,JOUR,Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide alters the interactions between bumblebees and wild plants,"['Stanley, DA', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.",2016/07//,2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12644,30,7,1132,1139,,,,0269-8463,WOS:000379978100012,,,0,

However, little is known about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.",2018/07/25/,2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0506,285,1883,,,,,,0962-8452,WOS:000439907900005,,,0,
799,JOUR,"Comparison of long-term changes in size and longevity of bee colonies in mid-west Japan and Maui with and without exposure to pesticide, cold winters, and mites","['Yamada, T.', 'Yamada, K.']",PeerJ,"Four long-term field experiments in mid-west Japan (Shika) made it clear that extinction of colonies exposed to neonicotinoid was much higher than for colonies exposed to organophosphates. The incidence of hive death for of organophosphate-exposed and control (pesticide-free) colonies was similar. We conducted a field experiment in Maui for 271 days using the same pesticides (dinotefuran: 0.2 ppm, clothianidin: 0.08 ppm, fenitrothion: 1 ppm) as used in Shika with the honeybee, Apis mellifera, colonies without mites. Numbers of adult bees, capped brood, mites and other hive parameters were accurately counted on photographs of combs and on the inside of the hives. All six neonicotinoid (dinotefuran & clothianidin)-exposed colonies failed during the experiment. One of three organophosphate (fenitrothion)-exposed colonies and one of the three control colonies also failed. The findings from Maui, where colonies displayed no mites, provides evidence from Shika, with mites, that neonicotinoids are more hazardous to honeybee colonies than organophosphates. The apparent longevity of honeybee colonies on Maui was estimated by numbers of adult bees and capped brood using a mathematical model previously proposed. Seasonal changes in longevity on Maui differ greatly from changes at Shika, the latter showing distinct seasonal variation. Longevity on Maui remains nearly constant throughout the year with wide variations. At Shika, it increases drastically in winter, by six- to ten fold more than the other seasons. Differences seem to depend on the existence of cold winters and the length of flowering seasons. In a perpetually hospitable environment, small changes in conditions can be sensitively reflected in apparent longevity. Examining wide variations in apparent longevity that are seemingly incoherent, we recognized several differences in apparent longevity between neonicotinoidexposed and organophosphate-exposed colonies: The colony that failed in after organophosphate-exposure colony group exhibited the longest apparent longevity and the fewest number of newly capped brood, as also was the case in control colonies. Extended longevity when few brood are newly produced is reasonable to maintain the colony from a physiological point of view. Extension of apparent longevity is not seen in neonicotinoid-exposed colonies when the number of newly capped brood is fewer. This finding suggests that neonicotinoid pesticides may inhibit normal apian physiology. ¬© Copyright 2020 Yamada and Yamada.",2020///,2020,10.7717/peerj.9505,8,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090275050&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.9505&partnerID=40&md5=6bb2b7ffaf2943243bb54bca46078721,Scopus,"['neonicotinoid', 'Article', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'clothianidin', 'field experiment', 'honeybee', 'adult', 'comparative study', 'Neonicotinoid', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'mite', 'Field experiment', 'Honeybee', 'long term exposure', 'organophosphate', 'Clothianidin', 'winter', 'dinotefuran', 'colony collapse', 'seasonal variation', 'mathematical phenomena', 'Dinotefuran', 'fenitrothion', 'insecticidal activity', 'Organophosphate', 'mathematical model', 'cold', 'Colony size', 'Fenitrothion', 'hospital', 'incidence', 'Maui', 'seed yield']",,,,,0,

Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication. Here we show that exposure to the field-relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid caused a reduction in bumblebee foraging activity, locomotion, and foraging rhythmicity. Foragers showed an increase in day-time sleep and an increase in the proportion of activity occurring at night. This could reduce foraging and pollination opportunities, reducing the ability of the colony to grow and reproduce, endangering bee populations and crop yields.",2020/12/18/,2020,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101827,23,12,,,,,"['Ecology', 'Animal Physiology', 'Behavioral Neuroscience', 'Biological Sciences', 'Zoology']",2589-0042,WOS:000600670000070,,,0,
654,JOUR,Toxic temperatures: Bee behaviours exhibit divergent pesticide toxicity relationships with warming,"['Kenna, D', 'Graystock, P', 'Gill, RJ']",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,"Climate change and agricultural intensification are exposing insect pollinators to temperature extremes and increasing pesticide usage. Yet, we lack good quantification of how temperature modulates the sublethal effects of pesticides on behaviours vital for fitness and pollination performance. Consequently, we are uncertain if warming decreases or increases the severity of different pesticide impacts, and whether separate behaviours vary in the direction of response. Quantifying these interactive effects is vital in forecasting pesticide risk across climate regions and informing pesticide application strategies and pollinator conservation. This multi-stressor study investigated the responses of six functional behaviours of bumblebees when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) or a sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) across a standardised low, mid, and high temperature. We found the neonicotinoid had a significant effect on five of the six behaviours, with a greater effect at the lower temperature(s) when measuring responsiveness, the likelihood of movement, walking rate, and food consumption rate. In contrast, the neonicotinoid had a greater impact on flight distance at the higher temperature. Our findings show that different organismal functions can exhibit divergent thermal responses, with some pesticide-affected behaviours showing greater impact as temperatures dropped, and others as temperatures rose. We must therefore account for environmental context when determining pesticide risk. Moreover, we found evidence of synergistic effects, with just a 3 degrees C increase causing a sudden drop in flight performance, despite seeing no effect of pesticide at the two lower temperatures.

Even though there is consensus that neonicotinoid insecticides can impact non-target animal fertility, their possible impact on male mating success is currently unknown in bees. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid significantly reduces both mating success and sperm traits of male bumblebees. Sexually mature male Bombus terrestris exposed to a field-realistic concentration of thiamethoxam (20 ng g‚àí1) or not (controls) were mated with virgin gynes in the laboratory. The results confirm sublethal negative effects of thiamethoxam on sperm quantity and viability. While the latency to mate was reduced, mating success was significantly impaired in thiamethoxam-exposed males by 32% probably due to female choice. Gynes mated by exposed males revealed impaired sperm traits compared to their respective controls, which may lead to severe constraints for colony fitness. Our laboratory findings demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male mating success in bees. Given that holds true for the field, this provides a plausible mechanism contributing to declines of wild bee populations globally. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may therefore have previously overlooked inadvertent anti-aphrodisiac effects on non-target animals, thereby limiting conservation efforts. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.12.003,9,,36,45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121333656&doi=10.1016%2fj.toxrep.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=9c8a52666298f54787e4ac0b40d754fe,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'honeybee', 'thiamethoxam', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'body mass', 'Neonicotinoid insecticide', 'mate choice', 'mating', 'mating success', 'fertility', 'egg laying', 'Sperm', 'aphrodisiac agent', 'Drone', 'Gyne', 'Mating']",,,,,0,

Using a highly replicated semi-field study with 56 mesocosms of varying wild plant diversity (2‚Äì16 species) and oilseed rape treated with a neonicotinoid, we tested the interacting effects of resource diversity and insecticides on reproduction of a solitary wild bee. Compared to mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures, availability of resources from wild plants complementing oilseed rape doubled brood cell production. In addition, bee reproduction increased due to plant diversity and identity effects. Exposure to neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape reduced bee larval to adult development by 69%, but only in mesocosms with oilseed rape monocultures. Availability of complementary flower resources can thus offset negative effects of neonicotinoid-treated oilseed rape on wild bee reproduction.

49,JOUR,Chronic acetamiprid exposure moderately affects the foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),"['T√≥th, Z.', 'Kov√°cs, Z.']",Ethology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators in both natural and agricultural ecosystems, but their survival and pollination service are threatened by extensive pesticide use. Due to regulation changes, acetamiprid has become the only neonicotinoid substance that can be used without restrictions and in open-field cultivations in the European Union. Yet, we know little about how this active ingredient affects bumblebees' foraging behaviour and if such effects are similarly detrimental to those of other neonicotinoids. Here we investigated how a 14-day-long (chronic) exposure to low (5 ppb) and high (2500 ppb) concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup affected different aspects of foraging behaviour in buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus). We recorded individual foraging at artificial food patches during one-hour-long trials and then compared several foraging-related measures between differently dosed individuals. We found that 75.12% of the total syrup consumption occurred at the first-exploited patch, but individuals did not exhibit any bias toward pesticide-treated food patches. Chronic exposure to acetamiprid had little effect on individual foraging decisions at the first-exploited food patch but significantly affected the time to the first feeding and the number of feedings at the second-exploited patch in interaction with body mass. The duration of the first feeding was affected only by foragers' body mass. Our finding indicates that chronic exposure to a high but field-realistic concentration of acetamiprid may alter some aspects of bumblebees' foraging behaviour. If such behavioural changes accumulate during consecutive foraging bouts, chronic exposure to this pesticide might lead to a reduction of daily resource collection, ultimately jeopardising colony fitness or plant (crop) pollination. ¬© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle. This implies that the synaptic development of honeybees is quite possibly greatly affected by low temperature stress.

In the field, imidacloprid impairs colony thermoregulation, including the construction of an insulating wax canopy.

Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to >= 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food.",2016/06/10/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0156886,11,6,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000377564000029,,,0,

The latter results in the frequent exposure of bumblebees to pesticides. We report here on a new bioassay that uses primary cultures of neurons derived from adult bumblebee workers to evaluate possible side-effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid. Mushroom bodies (MBs) from the brains of bumblebee workers were dissected and dissociated to produce cultures of Kenyon cells (KCs). Cultured KCs typically extend branched, dendrite-like processes called neurites, with substantial growth evident 24-48 h after culture initiation. Exposure of cultured KCs obtained from newly eclosed adult workers to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) imidacloprid, an environmentally relevant concentration of pesticide, did not have a detectable effect on neurite outgrowth. By contrast, in cultures prepared from newly eclosed adult bumblebees, inhibitory effects of imidacloprid were evident when the medium contained 25 ppb imidacloprid, and no growth was observed at 2,500 ppb. The KCs of older workers (13-day-old nurses and foragers) appeared to be more sensitive to imidacloprid than newly eclosed adults, as strong effects on KCs obtained from older nurses and foragers were also evident at 2.5 ppb imidacloprid. In conclusion, primary cultures using KCs of bumblebee worker brains offer a tool to assess sublethal effects of neurotoxic pesticides in vitro.

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid.

827,JOUR,Measuring foraging preferences in bumble bees: a comparison of popular laboratory methods and a test for sucrose preferences following neonicotinoid exposure,"['Richman, S.K.', 'Muth, F.', 'Leonard, A.S.']",Oecologia,"Animals develop food preferences based on taste, nutritional quality and to avoid environmental toxins. Yet, measuring preferences in an experimental setting can be challenging since ecologically realistic assays can be time consuming, while simplified assays may not capture natural sampling behavior. Field realism is a particular challenge when studying behavioral responses to environmental toxins in lab-based assays, given that toxins can themselves impact sampling behavior, masking our ability to detect preferences. We address these challenges by comparing different experimental methods for measuring sucrose concentration preference in bumble bees (Bombus impatiens), evaluating the utility of two preference chamber-based methods (ad libitum versus a novel restricted-sampling assay) in replicating bees‚Äô preferences when they fly freely between artificial flowers in a foraging arena. We find that the restricted-sampling method matched a free-flying scenario more closely than the ad libitum protocol, and we advocate for expanded use of this approach, given its ease of implementation. We then performed a second experiment using the new protocol to ask whether consuming the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid, known to suppress feeding motivation, interfered with the expression of sucrose preferences. After consuming imidacloprid, bees were less likely to choose the higher-quality sucrose even as they gained experience with both options. Thus, we provide evidence that pesticides interfere with bees‚Äô ability to discriminate between floral rewards that differ in value.

Inadvertent exposure to foraging insect pollinators is usually sub-lethal, but may affect cognition. One cognitive trait, spatial working memory, may be important in avoiding previously-visited flowers and other spatial tasks such as navigation. To test this, we investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial working memory in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, using an adaptation of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules. We then exposed bees to either a high sub-lethal positive control thiamethoxam dose (2.5 ng(-1) bee), or one of two low doses (0.377 or 0.091 ng(-1)) based on estimated field-realistic exposure. The high dose caused bees to make more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the task than unexposed bees.

Eight days after the single exposure, the results showed that TMX was extremely deleterious to the HNS at 0.00856 ng/bee, dramatically inducing morphological changes in HNS cells (trophocytes and oenocytes) and increasing hemocyte number. However, the treatment to TMX at 0.00856 ng/bee with additional NOS inoculation provoked the highest critical damage observed on HNS, collapsing the trophocytes, reducing the surface area of oenocytes, and inducing cell death in pericardial cells. Therefore, a sublethal dose of TMX, applied alone or simultaneously with NOS inoculation, triggered the disruption of the HNS and induced progressive damage on worker bees.

Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1111/een.12385,42,3,306,314,,,,0307-6946,WOS:000400032200008,,,0,

Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, are widely regarded as a substantial contributing factor to the decline in bumblebee populations, as evidenced by the detrimental impacts documented across many stages of their life cycle. Mating is vital for the population maintenance of bumblebees. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research conducted on the effects of pesticides on the mating process. In this study, we individually examined the impact of imidacloprid on the mating behavior of bumblebee males and queens. A competitive mating experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect on the competitive prowess of male individuals and the mate selection behavior of female individuals. The study revealed that the mating rate of bumblebees exposed to a concentration of 10 ppb of imidacloprid was 3 %. This finding demonstrated a statistically significant impact when compared to the control group, which exhibited a mating rate of 58 % in the normal mating experiment. Furthermore, in the competitive mating experiment, we found that the competitive mating success rate of treated males (1 %) was significantly lower than that of untreated males (35 %). Hence, it provides evidence that neonicotinoid imidacloprid negatively affects bumblebee mating success and cautions us to protect bumblebees from pesticide exposure to prevent a severe impact on their populations.",2024/06/10/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172525,928,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'Imidacloprids', 'pesticide residue', 'reproduction', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'Male', 'Reproduction', 'Imidacloprid', 'experimental study', 'sexual behavior', 'Sexual Behavior, Animal', 'ecological impact', 'Female', 'queen (insect)', 'pesticide exposure', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'Population statistics', 'physiological stress', 'seasonal variation', 'Bombu terrestri', 'duration', 'latent period', 'life cycle', 'Life cycle', 'mate choice', 'mating', 'Mating duration', 'Mating latency', 'Mating rate', 'mating success', 'Matings', 'Natural environments', 'relative humidity', 'sex difference', 'sexual maturity']",0048-9697,WOS:001233768300001,,,0,

Two apiaries were located in two independent neonicotinoid-treated cornfield areas and two others in two independent untreated cornfield areas used as controls. These experimental hives were extensively monitored for their performance and health traits over a period of one year. Trapped pollen was collected and microscopically identified to define the visited flowers and the amount of corn pollen collected by bees. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to detect pesticide residues in honeybee foragers and trapped pollen. Honeybee colonies located in neonicotinoid-treated cornfields expressed significantly higher varroa mite loads than those in untreated cornfields. However, brood production and colony weight were less disturbed by the treatment factor. Sublethal doses of neonicotinoids were detected in the trapped corn pollen and none in bee foragers. Overall, our results show that forager bees collected 20% of corn pollen containing variable concentrations of neonicotinoids.

670,JOUR,Neonicotinoids and Optimal Foraging Theory,"['Pyke, G.H.']",Environmental Advances,"Determination of how neonicotinoid ingestion affects the foraging behaviour of flower-visiting animals, and using Optimal Foraging Theory to assess the nature and extent of consequent changes to foraging efficiency, provide a novel approach for understanding how neonic ingestion affects the cognitive abilities of these animals, and their ultimate reproductive success. Neonicotinoids (neonics for short) are used worldwide as insecticides to protect agricultural crops, but may be ingested by non-target flower-visiting animals, such as bees, with negative impacts on their cognitive abilities and consequent adverse effects on their foraging behaviour, reproduction and pollination services. Optimal Foraging Theory may help to understand such effects as it hypothesises that nectar-feeding animals, including bees, will adopt foraging behaviour that maximises net rate of energy intake. Simple models of foraging movements exist but require further development to be useful in this regard. Observed movement patterns could then be compared with predicted patterns, derived from such models, and compared between neonicotinoid-affected and control individuals, with the expectation that control individuals will forage optimally, while neonicotinoid-affected individuals will not exhibit such behaviour and will exhibit reduced foraging success. However, there has been little attempt to develop and test predictions for cognitive foragers, like bees, that are moving between flowers or flower clusters, potentially limiting our ability to manage neonic-use to control agricultural pests. Addressing this gap should lead to enhanced knowledge and understanding of the impacts of neonics on non-target animals, along with other possible flow-on environmental impacts, including possible reductions in pollinator abundance and hence the harvest yields of crops requiring pollination, and could lead to refinements in policy and procedure for future use of neonics to control agricultural pests. The same issues apply to other insecticides and to interactions amongst insecticides. ¬© 2021 The Author",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100161,7,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121931806&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100161&partnerID=40&md5=ba9a047b9539b133e3a93207275811fc,Scopus,"['Neonicotinoids', 'Bee cognition', 'Foraging movements', 'Optimal Foraging Theory']",,,,,0,

A catch-and-release experimental design was applied in which feeder trained bees were caught when arriving at the feeder, treated with one of the neonicotinoids, and released 1.5 hours later at a remote site. The flight paths of individual bees were tracked with harmonic radar. The initial flight phase controlled by the recently acquired navigation memory (vector memory) was less compromised than the second phase that leads the animal back to the hive (homing flight). The rate of successful return was significantly lower in treated bees, the probability of a correct turn at a salient landscape structure was reduced, and less directed flights during homing flights were performed. Since the homing phase in catch-and-release experiments documents the ability of a foraging honeybee to activate a remote memory acquired during its exploratory orientation flights, we conclude that non-lethal doses of the three neonicotinoids tested either block the retrieval of exploratory navigation memory or alter this form of navigation memory.

Exposure to trace levels of these chemicals causes sub-lethal effects, such as reduced learning and foraging efficiency. Complex behaviours may be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids. Such behaviours may include buzz pollination (sonication), in which pollinators, usually bees, use innate and learned behaviours to generate high-frequency vibrations to release pollen from flowers with specialised anther morphologies. This study assesses the effect of field-realistic, chronic exposure to the widely-used neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on the development of sonication buzz characteristics over time, as well as the collection of pollen from buzz-pollinated flowers. We found that the pollen collection of exposed bees improved less with increasing experience than that of unexposed bees, with exposed bees collecting between 47% and 56% less pollen by the end of 10 trials. We also found evidence of two distinct strategies for maximising pollen collection: (1) extensions to the duration of individual buzzes and (2) extensions of the overall time spent buzzing. We find new complexities in buzz pollination, and conclude that the impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide may seriously compromise this important ecosystem service.",2017/11/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-14660-x,7,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000415166000058,,,0,

Pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. However, knowledge of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide in beekeeping practice, influencing on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development is lacking. Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group.

During the last decade elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (-28%) and brood (-13%), as well as a reduction in honey production (-29%) and pollen collections (-19%), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: queen supersedure was observed for 60% of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background. Conclusions/Significance: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner.

Bumblebees learned to invert inside a narrow tube and lift a petal-shaped barrier to reach a reward chamber. Imidacloprid-exposed bumblebees showed a dose-dependent delay to solve the task, which resulted from reduced switching between behavioural strategies and a subsequent delay in use of the successful strategy.

Colonies grew heavier near thiacloprid-treated clover compared to controls lacking clover, while colonies near untreated clover did not differ from colonies in neither of the other landscape types. Thiacloprid treatment effectively controlled pests and increased bumblebee crop visitation. However, colony production of queens and males did not differ among landscape types.

832,JOUR,Agricultural landscape composition affects the development and life expectancy of colonies ofBombus impatiens,"['Gervais, A', 'Fournier', 'B√©lisle, M']",ECOSPHERE,"Bumble bees are essential, efficient pollinators of numerous crops, and scientists are increasingly concerned about their global decline. Although several potential causes have been put forward, the concurrent modification of landscape structure and pesticide use by agriculture are often pointed out as the main drivers of the decline. Yet, the mechanisms through which these factors cause species to decline remain elusive. Most field studies have been conducted at the individual level, and the few studies that addressed higher levels of organization only covered narrow ecological conditions. We undertook a field experiment in spring 2016 to overcome these limitations by placing four commercialBombus impatienscolonies in each of 20 sites located along a gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We hypothesized that landscape habitat composition and configuration, as well as local floral resources, would affect colony development. We expected colonies surrounded by low-intensity and/or flowering crops in heterogeneous landscapes to develop better and live longer, partly linked to more abundant and diversified food resources, than colonies embedded in landscapes dominated by high-intensity crops. Colonies were weighed once a week, and workers were captured to assess pollen load diversity. Final colony weight, queen production, and presence of depredators (Aphomia sociella, Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were also recorded. Landscape habitat composition and configuration were characterized within 1 km of colonies. Local availability of floral resources was assessed within 100 m of colonies every two weeks. As predicted, colony weight and longevity decreased with the proportion of intensive crops and increased with the amount of flowering crops, but queen production and the occurrence ofA. sociellawere not affected by landscape composition.

In each site, three locations were directly adjacent to OSR fields, three locations were situated 400 m apart from the nearest OSR field. The development of colonies was monitored from the begin of OSR blossom in April until June 2014. Pollen from returning foragers was analysed for its composition and residue content. At the end of OSR blossom hives were removed from the study sites and eventually dissected assessing young queens as well as the undeveloped queen brood cells. An average of 44% of OSR pollen was found in the pollen loads of bumblebees indicating that 0513 was a major resource for the colonies. Colony development in terms of hive weight and the number of workers showed a typical course no statistically significant differences were found between the sites.

The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 ï¿½ï¿½L for honeybees and to 2 ï¿½ï¿½L for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower fod mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 The Aut",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,1,1,

'wild blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. ï¿½ï¿½ 2011 Springer-Ver",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133,140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,0,1,

The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids.

Among them, 20 derivatives had bioconcentrations lower than that of Compound 19 (reduced by 0.38ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½147.88%). Further screening of Compound 19 and the 20 derivatives mentioned above by homology modeling and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) moleculs showed that 10 derivatives had bi-directional selective toxic effects against pests and bees. Further docking analyses of Compound 19 and these 10 derivatives identified that Derivative-33 showed decreased docking with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S transferase (GST) in pests and enhanced docking with these enzymes in bees, indicating bi-directional selective resistance for pests and bees. Accordingly, Derivative-33 was selected as a new insecticide with high toxicity to pests and low toxicity to bees (bi-directional selective toxicity), low resistance in pest populations, and high resistance in bee populations. This study provides valuable reference data and will be useful for the development of strategies to produce new environmentally friendly pesticides. ï¿½ï¿½ 2018 Elsevier ",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.08.055,164,,,,467,473,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051817245&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.08.055&partnerID=40&md5=c505c60f4b3e2fff4cb2bf86baeedeff,Scopus,,,0,1,

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations.

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to ï¿½ï¿½8 subunit of nAChmellifera. The ï¿½ï¿½8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations. ï¿½ï¿½ 2019 The",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.048,130,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067030671&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2019.05.048&partnerID=40&md5=34ecfc9dc6470b6f2a0d591bc7f7df71,Scopus,,,0,1,

Its specificity depends on the distinctiveness of the target gene sequence for a given species. In this work, we assessed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (A. pisum) the use of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets the beta 2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (dsRNA-beta 2), which shares low sequence identity with other subunits, to control populations of this pest at different developmental stages. Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½0.0006) ï¿½ï¿½g active ingredient (a.i.) beeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin,d abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effen syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 The Aut",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,0,1,

The LC50 values (ng a.i./ï¿½ï¿½l of diet) and the decreasing order of toxicity for P. emerina was spinosad (4.96) > malathion (18.75) > phosmet (97.33) > acetamiprid (4204.06), and for T. fiebrigi also was spinosad (5.65) > malathion (8.39) > phosmet (53.91) > acetamiprid (9841.32), when orally exposed. The LD50 values (ng a.i./bee) and the decreasing order of toxicity for P. emerina was spinosad (1.90) > malathion (10.90) > phosmet (19.54) > amiprid (6216.55) and for T. fiebrigi was malathion (29.29) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ spinosad (29.79) > phosmet (41.95) > acetamiprid (1421.23), when topically exposed. The mean survival (hours) of contaminated bees by malathion, phosmet, and spinosad, was 11.81, 7.20, and 12.32 for P. emerina and 8.55, 7.20, and 13.34 for T. fiebrigi when orally exposed; and was 4.87, 9.87 and 11.17 for P. emerina, and 4.87, 4.76, and 19.05 for T. fiebrigi when topically exposed. Malathion, phosmet, and spinosad were highly toxic, while acetamiprid was moderately toxic. Our results indicated that the insecticides tested, mainly malathion, phosmet, and spinosad may be harmful to P. emerina and T. fiebrigi, making it essential to propose measures to minimize their impact on wild pollinators. ï¿½ï¿½ 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Spring",2020///,2020,10.1007/s10646-019-02150-x,29,1,,,119,128,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077050215&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-019-02150-x&partnerID=40&md5=238c3ae7869e4bbbfda1717471ce3533,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'adult', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Apidae', 'Apoidea', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'concentration (composition)', 'controlled study', 'drug combination', 'Drug Combinations', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'LC50', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Lethal effect', 'macrolide', 'Macrolides', 'malathion', 'Malathion', 'Meliponinae', 'Native bees', 'native species', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Neotropics', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide resistance', 'Pesticides', 'phosmet', 'physiology', 'Plebeia', 'Plebeia emerina', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'priority journal', 'species diversity', 'spinosad', 'stingless bee', 'survival rate', 'Tetragonisca', 'Tetragonisca fiebrigi', 'toxicity']",,0,1,

Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)), then compared these RQs to a level of concern. For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees.

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. ï¿½ï¿½ 2019 by the auth",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074627857&doi=10.3390%2finsects10110382&partnerID=40&md5=1d7cd991c5dc71ff1cccacd749911b7f,Scopus,,,0,1,

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2ï¿½ï¿½ deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Our findings suggest that additivity is a good baseline for predicting the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to bees, and that the rare cases of synergy of pesticide mixtures to bees are not random but have a mechanistic basis. ï¿½ï¿½ 2022 The",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159518,857,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140783605&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.159518&partnerID=40&md5=6f800aae18835c979ed4c168161574ac,Scopus,"['acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'additive', 'Additive effects', 'Additives', 'additivity', 'Additivity', 'additivity effect', 'additivity predictions', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'biological activity', 'clothianidin', 'coefficient of variation', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration addition', 'Concentration addition', 'concentration addition model', 'cyfluthrin', 'cyhalothrin', 'cypermethrin', 'deltamethrin', 'endosulfan', 'ethiprole', 'etofenprox', 'experimental cumulative distribution function', 'experimental design', 'experimental toxicity', 'exposure route', 'exposure time', 'fenpropidin', 'fipronil', 'fluoxastrobin', 'flupyradifurone', 'Food products', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Honey bee', 'honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'isoflucypram', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'methamidophos', 'methiocarb', 'mixture deviation ratio', 'mixtures', 'Mixtures', 'non additive effects', 'Non-additive', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'pesticides', 'Pesticides', 'physical parameters', 'prevalence', 'probability', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'spiromesifen', 'spirotetramat', 'spiroxamine', 'synergistic effect', 'synergy', 'Synergy', 'tebuconazole', 'tetraniliprole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiodicarb', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicological parameters', 'transfluthrin', 'triadimenol', 'unclassified drug']",,0,1,

In 2015 to 2016, the combined concentration of the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin detected in hummingbird cloacal fluid from sites near conventionally sprayed blueberry fields was 3.63 ng/mL (ppb). Among the 18 compounds measured in fecal pellets, including one neonicotinoid (imidacloprid), only piperonyl butoxide was detected (1.47ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½5.96 ng/g). Piperonyl butoxide is a cytochrome P450 inhibitor applied with some insecticides to increase their toxic efficacy. Only diazinon was detected in bumble bees (0.197 ng/g), whereas diazinon (1.54ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1.7 ng/g) and imidacloprid (up to 18.4 ng/g) were detected in pollen collected from bumble bees including the bees from organic sites located near conventionally sprayed blueberry farms. Imidacloprid was also detected at 5.16 ng/g in blueberry flowers collected 1 yr post spray from 1 of 6 conventionally sprayed blueberry farms.

The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI). Finally, in both insects nAChRs, THI is consistently found to bind more favourably than IMI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

68,JOUR,Design of environmentally friendly neonicotinoid insecticides with bioconcentration tuning and Bi-directional selective toxic effects,"['Zhao, YY', 'Li, Y']",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"A 3D-QSAR model was established with CoMSIA to characterize neonicotinoid insecticides. LgBCF values were used as the dependent variable and the molecular structures of 30 compounds were used as the independent variable. This model was used to design neonicotinoid insecticides with reduced bioconcentration. The contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model were used to evaluate substituted sites and different substituents that significantly affected the bioconcentration of neonicotinoid insecticides. The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024/08/29/,2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11,1,2196-5641,WOS:001303583400003,,,,,"['AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Cowpea aphid', 'Honeybee', 'NAChR', 'Neonicotinoids']",,0,0,

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals.

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016/04//,2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,2,0022-0493,WOS:000374497000004,515,519,,,,,0,0,

Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the b dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the ï¿½ï¿½-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain.

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybeesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 by th",2024///,2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,4,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187202591&doi=10.3390%2fani14040608&partnerID=40&md5=bee8613fa13ab09e8899b833165a5703,Scopus,"['animal health and welfare', 'aphid', 'Article', 'bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF)', 'bergamot oil', 'colony forming unit', 'diet supplementation', 'Escherichia coli', 'flupyradifurone', 'food intake', 'honeybee', 'honeybee (Apis mellifera)', 'insecticide', 'intoxication', 'LC50', 'mass spectrometry', 'mortality rate', 'natural products', 'nonhuman', 'pilot study', 'poisoning', 'pollination', 'psyllid', 'Salmonella', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography', 'unclassified drug', 'whitefly']",,0,0,

We conducted a semi-field experiment to examine the single and interactive effects of the novel insecticide flupyradifurone (FPF) and nutritional stress on fitness proxies in the solitary bee Osmia bicornis. Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure. Within the first day after application of FPF, mortality of bees feeding on buckwheat was 29 times higher compared with control treatments, while mortality of FPF exposed and control bees was similar in the other two plant species. Moreover, we found negative synergistic impacts of FPF and nutritional stress on offspring production, flight activity, flight duration and flower visitation frequency.

In this study, pesticide application patterns in wheat-maize rotation system, vegetable and apple producing areas, was studied by interviewing farmers in Quzhou County, the North China Plain. The pesticide use status was evaluated by the recommended and actual applied dose and risk quotient (RQ) based Bee-REX model was used to assess the exposure risks of pesticide to bees based on the collected pesticide application data. The results showed that over half (52 %) of farmers in selected sites misused pesticides and orchard owners were frequently misused pesticides. Positive correlations were found between pesticide usage performance and farmers' specialized training experience. Pesticides applied in orchards have caused higher exposure risks to bees with the mean of RQs exceed 120 and 1880 via acute contact and dietary routes, respectively. Pesticide misuse significantly elevates the exposure risk to bees that the mean RQ under misuse scenarios was 5.8 times than that of correct use.

In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload.

[Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature.

In the present study, the effects of chronic FPF exposure on bees were systematically investigated at the individual behavioral, tissue, cell, enzyme activity, and the gene expression levels. Chronic exposure (14 d) to FPF led to reduced survival (12 mg/L), body weight gain (4 and 12 mg/L), and food utilization efficiency (4 and 12 mg/L). Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis.

Public concerns over property damage, environmental impact and public health led to the immediate need and acceptability of alternative pesticide/bait combinations. Preliminary work with spinosad, a derivative of a soil microorganism developed by Dow AgroSciences, in combination with a new bait (SolBait) showed promise. To ensure that this product would be effective in Florida for fruit fly control, three field tests were conducted using aerial and/or foliar applications. Results indicated that sprays with spinosad-SolBait provided comparable and significant control levels for sterile Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies in comparison to standard malathion with NU-LUREï¿½ï¿½ or SolBait treatments by aerial or foliar application. In one test, honey bees and hives were exposed to sprays in the treatment area and no significant treatment differences were obed in hive condition or brood.

Firstly, the main insecticides for three stages of cotton growth were identified under the lateral mixing condition. Insecticides for the first phase included abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b), acetamiprid (N-(N-cyano-ethylimine)-N-methyl-2-chloropyridine-5-methylamine), dicofol (1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol) and cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester); the insecticides available in the second phase included cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), phoxim (O,O-diethyl-O-ï¿½ï¿½-cyanophine thiophosphate ester), deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester)-cyano-diphenyl ether) and abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b). In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicby 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%. Finally, by calculating the resultant force from different types of non-bonded forces, the mechanism of the effect of the optimal application scheme on bees and pests under two scenarios was analyzed. The optimally combined scheme prepared by screening could provide the bi-directional selectivity to bees and pests.

These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'. This suggests that agrochemical risk assessments are not protecting pollinators from the unintended consequences of pesticide use.  ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 The Auth",2024,2024,10.1098/rsos.231798,11,5,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193238788&doi=10.1098%2frsos.231798&partnerID=40&md5=03be6a6c1d0fb9c0f9bd68e75f929ef3,,bee behaviour; Bombus; interaction effects; pesticide; pollinators; poor nutrition,,0,0,
81,JOUR,Neonicotinoid insecticide interact with honeybee odorant-binding protein: Implication for olfactory dysfunction,"['Li, HL', 'Wu, F', 'Zhao, L', 'Tan, J', 'Jiang, HT', 'Hu, FL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES,"The decline of bee population has caused great concern in recent years. A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before. This study may benefit to evaluate the effect of neonicotinoid insecticides on the olfactory cognitive behavior of bees involved in the crops pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

80,JOUR,A sublethal dose of neonicotinoid imidacloprid precisely sensed and detoxified by a C-minus odorant-binding protein 17 highly expressed in the legs of Apis cerana,"['Qiu, Y.-L.', 'Wu, F.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Jiang, H.-Q.', 'Chen, J.-T.', 'Pan, Y.-J.', 'Li, H.-L.']",Science of the Total Environment,"As a native honeybee species in East Asia, Apis cerana is essential for the stability of local agricultural and plant ecosystems by its' olfactory system for searching nectar and pollen sources. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 ï¿½ï¿½ 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana.

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure. This new approach to measure risk is more accurate and could become a tool to aid the decision-making process in the risk assessment of pesticides. ï¿½ï¿½ 2014 Poquet et",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113728,9,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84913553440&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0113728&partnerID=40&md5=0bd734a30f96cf5929cbd058f27dc9d0,Scopus,,,0,0,

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data. The ligand-based combined with structure-based approaches remain a powerful tool in the design of new environment-friendly and less toxic organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides.",2020///,2020,,,,1557-2153,WOS:000674448200022,513,544,,,,,0,0,

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding.

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees. Our study emphasizes the impact of a nursery neonicotinoid formulation on solitary bee foraging and reproduction, while highlighting interactions between irrigation level and neonicotinoid application in containerized plants themselves.  ï¿½ï¿½ 2021 The Auth",2021///,2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.1287,288,1955,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112616684&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2021.1287&partnerID=40&md5=ccbc25face125461bdf205b87eb2db2f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Gardens', 'Hymenoptera', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'irrigation', 'land use', 'Megachile rotundata', 'Megachilidae', 'native species', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoids', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nursery ground', 'ornamental species', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Phacelia tanacetifolia', 'Plant Nectar', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'soil moisture']",,0,0,

This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UVï¿½ï¿½ï¿½visible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's ï¿½ï¿½-helix content, suggesting structuralns.

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality.

One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticidesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for upree days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day.

11,JOUR,FIPRONIL AND IMIDACLOPRID REDUCE HONEYBEE MITOCHONDRIAL ACTIVITY,"['Nicodemo, D', 'Maioli, MA', 'Medeiros, HCD', 'Guelfi, M', 'Balieira, KVB', 'De Jong, D', 'Mingatto, FE']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Bees have a crucial role in pollination; therefore, it is important to determine the causes of their recent decline. Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

Unfortunately, as many as 40% of crop pollinators are in a steep decline due to habitat loss and exposure to agrochemicals. Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40). Concurrent, colocated total suspended particulate matter samples contained multiple insecticides and parasiticides including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones, in significantly higher concentrations downwind of feedyards (bifenthrin, 8.45 ï¿½ï¿½ 4.92; permethrin, 1032.34 ï¿½ï¿½ 740.76; clothianidin, 3.61 ï¿½ï¿½ 1.48; imidacloprid, 73.32 ï¿½ï¿½ 47.52; thiamethoxam, 5.81 ï¿½ï¿½ 3.16; abamectin, 0.45 ï¿½ï¿½ 0.29; ivermectin, 8.88 ï¿½ï¿½ 5.06 ng/g). Honeybees and mason bees sited downwind of feedyards always experienced higher mortality than those correspondingly sited upwind, and male mason bees experienced significantly higher mortality compared to females when both were sited downwind. Bees occurring downwind of beef cattle feedyards for 1 h are 232-260% more likely to die than those occurring upwind. Thus, agrochemicals used on and emitted from beef cattle feedyards are significant threats to bee pollinators. ï¿½ï¿½",2023///,2023,10.1021/acs.est.3c03135,57,40,,,14839,14848,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172274460&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.3c03135&partnerID=40&md5=0b7afd64c1c6444b9f23500b2d0b73dd,Scopus,"['abamectin', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'agrochemicals', 'Agrochemicals', 'angiosperm', 'animal', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee pollinator', 'bee pollinators', 'Beef', 'beef cattle', 'Beef cattle feedyards', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'bovine', 'Cattle', 'Cell proliferation', 'clothianidin', 'environmental exposure', 'Esters', 'feeding behavior', 'Feedyard', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee', 'honeybees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'insecticides', 'Insecticides', 'ivermectin', 'lactone', 'Lactones', 'Macrocyclic lactones', 'male', 'Male', 'Mason bee', 'mason bees', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Parasiticide', 'parasiticides', 'Particles (particulate matter)', 'particulate matter', 'Particulate Matter', 'permethrin', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'Pyrethroids', 'suspended particulate matter', 'thiamethoxam', 'toxicity']",,0,0,
116,JOUR,Sub-lethal but potentially devastating - The novel insecticide flupyradifurone impairs collective brood care in bumblebees,"Fischer, L.R.; Ramesh, D.; Weidenmï¿½ï¿½ller",Science of the Total Environment,"The worldwide decline in pollinating insects is alarming. One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. ï¿½ï¿½ 2023 The Aut",2023,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168103283&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166097&partnerID=40&md5=71fd9fafbe9b7749bcfa557154545900,,agriculture; Agriculture; animal experiment; animal parameters; animal tissue; anthropogenic effect; Anthropogenics; Apis; Article; Assessment procedure; bee; Bombus terrestris; Brood development; brood temperature; bumblebee; collective brood care; Collective thermoregulation; colony growth; Colony growth; controlled study; dietary exposure; flupyradifurone; glyphosate; herbicide; Herbicides; insecticide; Insecticides; Microcolonies; Mortality rate; nonhuman; organism colony; Parasite-; pesticide; Pesticides; Pollinator crisis; risk assessment; Risk assessment; Risks assessments; temperature; thermoregulation; unclassified drug,,0,0,

This study evaluated the simultaneous effects of microplastics, flupyradifurone, and N. ceranae on honey bee health, focusing on survival rates, N. ceranae replication, daily food consumption, and bee midgut histological alterations. Results showed a significant decrease in bee longevity across all treatments compared to the control, with the combination of flupyradifurone, microplastics, and N. ceranae having the most severe impact. Microplastics and flupyradifurone exposure also increased N. ceranae proliferation, especially in bees subjected to both stressors.

9,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of clothianidin exposure of drones at sexual maturity stage, on antioxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and on protein content of semen. Our results show for the first time that clothianidin elicits significant increases in superoxide dismutase, of glutathione peroxidase, of catalase and of MDA level.

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. ï¿½ï¿½ 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. ï¿½ï¿½ 2020 Elsevier ",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,0,0,

Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed.

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes.

112,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/foodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½oral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not hostrogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey beesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. ï¿½ï¿½ 2023 by th",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,0,0,

We acquired 1-day-old, 20-day-old, and 2-year-old queens and 1-day-old and 20-day-old workers (foragers) fed 0, 5, or 200 ppb imidacloprid, a pesticide oxidative stressor. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase and the level of total antioxidant potential were determined in hemolymph. The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. ï¿½ï¿½ 2021 by the authors.

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination.

We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5ï¿½ï¿½mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10ï¿½ï¿½days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, ï¿½ï¿½-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut ï¿½ï¿½-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activixidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition.

We exposed bees of both sexes to a sublethal concentration of flupyradifurone. Various behaviors were registered in a mating arena with two females (one unexposed and one exposed) and one male (either unexposed or exposed). Unexposed males were quicker to attempt to mate. Treatment also impacted precopulatory behavior and male quality assessment by females. Males approached unexposed females more quickly than insecticide-exposed ones. Females exposed to insecticide produced lower amounts of some cuticular hydrocarbons (sex pheromone candidates) and appeared less choosy than unexposed females.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449,461,,,,,0,0,

In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field.

We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounr, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

All these biochemical side effects may lead to colony depopulation during future biotic/abiotic stress.",2020/08//,2020,10.1007/s13592-020-00747-4,51,4,0044-8435,WOS:000520675500001,620,630,,,"['acceleration', 'Apis mellifera', 'biochemistry', 'biomarker', 'cuticle', 'DNA', 'DNA methylation', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'inhibition', 'inhibitor', 'methylation', 'phosphatase', 'proteolysis', 'senescence', 'thiol']",,0,0,
