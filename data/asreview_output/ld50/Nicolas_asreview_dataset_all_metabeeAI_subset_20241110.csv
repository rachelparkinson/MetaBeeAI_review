In Brazil, stingless bees are responsible for 40% to 90% of tree species pollination, depending on the considered ecosystem. However, their survival has been threatened since the country has been standing out as a big consumer of pesticides. Many of the pesticides used are considered toxic to bees, including imidacloprid. Although the bees are not the target of these substances, they are highly vulnerable to contamination. Thereby, the objective of this study was to establish the mean lethal dose (LD50) and the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid for the M. Scutellaris. In order to carry out this experiment, bees were collected and the test was performed according to OECD's protocol (1998a, 1998b), developed for A. mellifera. For the determination of LD50 and LC50, data was analyzed through the Probit method. The topical LD50 established in this study was 2.41 ng/bee for 24 hours and 1.29 ng/bee for 48 hours. The oral LC50 was 2.01 ng i.a./ŒºL for 24 hours and 0.81 ng i.a./ŒºL for 48 hours. Thus, it is important to establish management methods which take this higher susceptibility into account to protect native species.",2015///,2015,10.13102/sociobiology.v62i4.792,62.0,4,578,582,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953716373&doi=10.13102%2fsociobiology.v62i4.792&partnerID=40&md5=aae2b84354f37183e15489b22f97bb39,Scopus,,,,,,1,1,1,
69,349,JOUR,A Combined LD50 for Agrochemicals and Pathogens in Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris [Hymenoptera: Apidae]),"['Siviter, H', 'Matthews, AJ', 'Brown, MJF']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide in the world and can have significant sub-lethal impacts on beneficial insects, including bumblebees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wild-flowers. This has led to bans on neonicotinoid use in the EU and has resulted in repeated calls for the agrochemical regulatory process to be modified. For example, there is increasing concern about 1) the underrepresentation of wild bees, such as bumblebees, in the regulatory process, and 2) the failure to determine how agrochemicals, such as neonicotinoids, interact with other commonly occurring environmental stressors, such as parasites. Here, we modify an OECD approved lethal dose (LD50) experimental design and coexpose bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and the highly prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, in a fully crossed design. We found no difference in the LD50 of thiamethoxam on bumblebees that had or had not been inoculated with the parasite (Crithidia bombi). Furthermore, thiamethoxam dosage did not appear to influence the parasite intensity of surviving bumblebees, and there was no effect of either parasite or insecticide on sucrose consumption. The methodology used demonstrates how existing ring-tested experimental designs can be effectively modified to include other environmental stressors such as parasites. Moving forward, the regulatory process should implement methodologies that assess the interactions between agrochemicals and parasites on non-Apis bees and, in cases when this is not practical, should implement post-regulatory monitoring to better understand the real-world consequences of agrochemical use.",2022/04/22/,2022,10.1093/ee/nvab139,51.0,2,378,384,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'thiamethoxam', 'pathogen', 'Thiamethoxam', 'LD50', 'agrochemical', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'Bombus', 'Crithidia bombi', 'toxicity test', 'Crithidia']",0046-225X,WOS:000785870400009,,,1,2,1,

The present study was aimed towards establishing the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of three pesticides viz. carbamate (carbaryl), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) in honeybees through feeding bioassay laboratory trial. Deleteriousness was confirmed through mortality rate, number of survival bees, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), total protein (TP) levels, AChE gene transcription level, and gut tissues histological analysis of exposed honeybees. Mean mortality rate was calculated for 96 h interval at three different concentrations of tested pesticides (5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg L-1), and LC50 values calculated for 48 and 96 h interval. AChE enzyme and TP level are determined by ELIZA and spectrophotometer, respectively. Results revealed that imidacloprid had the lowest LC50 (0.477 ng/bee) values as compared with carbaryl and chlorpyrifos. High mortality rate was observed at highest dose, being impidacloprid have more lethal effects as compared with other pesticides. Similarly, biochemical analysis revealed that imidiacloprid and chlorpyrifos significantly (P <= 0.05) increased AChE and TP levels, whereas carbaryl significantly (P <= 0.05) decreased them. Similarly, probe based RT qPCR revealed that imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatments significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the AChE level whereas carbaryl decreased it. Histological analysis showed that the gut tissues of honeybees exposed to pesticide treatment had substantial morphological abnormalities.

Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25 medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50 were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively.

248,528,JOUR,Surrogate species in pesticide risk assessments: Toxicological data of three stingless bees species,"['Lourencetti, A.P.S.', 'Azevedo, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Environmental Pollution,"Discussions about environmental risk reassessment of pesticides have grown in the last decades, especially in tropical and subtropical regions since the diversity of bee species in these places is quite different. Stingless bees are highly affected by pesticides, and toxicity information is necessary to include them in the regulatory process of countries that hosts a diversity of these species. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50), estimate the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) and compared the sensitivity of three species of stingless bees exposed to the commercial formulation of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TMX). The LD50 was estimated based on the LC50 determined in the present study (LC50 = 0.329 ng a.i./ŒºL for Tetragonisca angustula; 0.624 ng a.i./ŒºL for Scaptotrigona postica, and 0.215 ng a.i./ŒºL for Melipona scutellaris). Considering these data, toxicity endpoints were used to fit species sensitive distribution curves (SSD) and determine the sensitivity ratio. The results showed that all the stingless bees tested are more sensitive to TMX than the Apis mellifera, the model organism used in ecotoxicological tests. Regarding the oral LC50, the most susceptible and most tolerant species were M. scutellaris > T. angustula > S. postica > A. mellifera. Following the same evaluated pattern, for the LD50 (considering the weight of the bees - ng a.i./g bee), we have: M. scutellaris > S. postica > T. angustula > A. mellifera, and without the weight considered (ng a.i./bee): T. angustula > M. scutellaris > S. postica > A. mellifera. The different sensitivities among stingless bee species highlight the importance of inserting more than one surrogate species with a variety of sizes in research and protocol development. Additionally, the research suggests the need to investigate patterns regarding the influence of body mass on pesticide sensitivity among stingless bee species. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120842,318.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144079658&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2022.120842&partnerID=40&md5=76784e21ad6b201448cabf3e1b119948,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'thiamethoxam', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'stingless bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'toxicology', 'body mass', 'body weight', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'LC50', 'sensitivity analysis', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'species difference', 'Tropics', 'Body weight', 'Melipona scutellaris', 'Tetragonisca angustula', 'Environmental risks', 'species sensitivity distribution', 'Tropical regions', 'Population distribution', 'sensitivity ratio', 'species', 'Species sensitivity distribution', 'Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD)', 'Species sensitivity distributions', 'surrogate species']",,,,,1,7,0,

Neonicotinoid insecticides are one of the most widely used pesticides in tomato crops in Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was carried out to investigate the toxicity of four neonicotinoid insecticides (clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) to bumblebees based on the OECD guidelines (No.246, 247). The 48 hr LD50 (Œºg a.i. /bumblebee) values in the acute contact toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.467; dinotefuran, 3.741; imidacloprid, 3.967; and thiamethoxam, 0.747. The 48 hr LD50 values in the acute oral toxicity tests were determined as follows: clothianidin, 0.005; dinotefuran, 0.056; imidacloprid, 0.325; and thiamethoxam, 0.018. The acute contact and oral toxicity of the test insecticides to bumblebees from most to least toxic was clothianidin > thiamethoxam > dinotefuran > imidacloprid.

However, given the economic and ecological importance of stingless bees such as Melipona scutellaris in the Neotropical region, as well as the lack of studies on the effect of insecticides on these bees, toxicity tests for stingless bees should be carried out to understand whether insecticides affect both species of bees in the same manner. Thus, the present study quantified the differential sensitivity of the bees M. scutellaris and A. mellifera to the oral ingestion of the insecticide thiamethoxam by determining the mean lethal concentration (LC50), mean lethal time (LT50), and their effect on the insecticide target organ, the brain. The results showed that the stingless bee is more sensitive to the insecticide than A. mellifera, with a lower LC50 of 0.0543 ng active ingredient (a.i.)/ŒºL for the stingless bee compared to 0.227 ng a.i./ŒºL for A. mellifera. When exposed to a sublethal concentration, morphological and ultrastructural analyses were performed and evidenced a significant increase in spaces between nerve cells of both species.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the lethal and sublethal concentrations of the insecticide thiamethoxam, with evaluation of its sublethal effects on mobility, in the stingless bee Plebeia catamarcensis (Holmberg, 1903). Foraging bees were collected and exposed to thiamethoxam to determine lethal (LC50) and sublethal concentrations. The 24 h LC50 was 0.408 ng a.i./ŒºL, a value demonstrating that this species may be as sensitive as other stingless bees already studied. Sublethal concentrations influenced the locomotion abilities of the bees, making them hyperactive when exposed to LC50/10 and lethargic when exposed to LC50/100. The effects of sublethal concentrations on individuals may have collective consequences, especially in colonies with few individuals, as is the case of P. catamarcensis.

However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/ŒºL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen.

Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

Hence, the exposure and effects of pesticides is also likely to vary among these different species. The aim of this study was to develop an analytical method to determine the presence of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the Brazilian native stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula (local common name: Jata√≠). The method used for the chemical analysis involved a QuEChERS technique combined with UHPLC-MS/MS analysis. The developed method was subsequently used to analyze collected field samples. In addition, the acute toxicity of the pesticide to T. angustula was evaluated in a laboratory bioassay evaluating both lethal and sublethal endpoints. The analytical method was successfully developed with detection and quantification limits of 1.55 and 5 Œºg L‚àí1, respectively, along with a linear range of 1‚Äì5 ng mL‚àí1. Clothianidin was detected in environmental samples (9.2‚Äì32.9 ng g‚àí1), and the exposure experiments demonstrated acute oral toxicity to adults of T. angustula, (24 h-LD50 of 0.16 ng a.i./bee), as well as no significative interference in acetylcholinesterase activity. Considering the obtained toxicity endpoints for T. angustula and those reported in the literature for other bee species, this study revealed that T. angustula is more (lethally) sensitive to clothianidin than other bee species, including those commonly used in environmental risk assessment studies.

The paradox between the benefits that these animals represent to humans and the evidence of human activities driving their extinction calls for the urgent protection of bees. To address the role of chemical pollution in this scenario, we assessed the acute toxicity as well as four biomarker responses (cholinesterase [ChE], glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation [LPO]) elicited by dietary 24-h exposure to three insecticides (malathion, imidacloprid, and fipronil) on the stingless neotropical bee Tetragonisca angustula and the honeybee Apis mellifera. Malathion was the most toxic substance to both species, with 48-h median lethal doses (LD50s) of 0.25 ng/bee to A. mellifera and 0.02 ng/bee to T. angustula. Fipronil was also highly toxic and presented a similar toxicity to both species, with 48-h LD50s of 0.5 ng/bee (A. mellifera) and 0.4 ng/bee (T. angustula). Imidacloprid had the lowest acute toxicity with a 48-h LD50 of 29 ng/bee for A. mellifera, whereas T. angustula tolerated exposure higher than 35 ng/bee. Apparent biomarker responses were observed in bees of both species that survived exposure to higher concentrations of malathion (ChE inhibition) and fipronil (increased LPO).

The study also compared the sensitivity of the three species to the standard insecticide Dimethoate, and the results confirmed that T. angustula was the most sensitive. The findings of this study provide crucial ecotoxicological information, particularly concerning the residual effects of neonicotinoids on stingless bees. This evidence reinforces the urgent need to expand research on the effects of neonicotinoids on these important pollinators, so commonly found in nature and meliponaries.

This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of ‚àº4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively.

Acute intoxication by imidacloprid or its metabolites resulted in the rapid appearance of neurotoxicity symptoms, such as hyperresponsiveness, hyperactivity, and trembling and led to hyporesponsiveness and hypoactivity. For acute toxicity tests, bees were treated with doses of toxic compounds ranging from 1 to 1,000 ng/bee (10-10,000 Œºg/kg). Acute toxicity (LD50) values of imidacloprid were about 60 ng/bee (600 Œºg/kg) at 48 h and about 40 ng/bee (400 Œºg/kg) at 72 and 96 h.

This is critical for understanding their responses to, and defenses against, a variety of environmental stresses, including agrochemicals. Therefore, we studied the detoxification and immune responses of a stingless bee, Nanotrigona perilampoides, which is an important stingless bee that is widely distributed throughout Mexico, including urban areas, and has the potential to be used in commercial pollination. We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/¬µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/¬µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days.

Furthermore, unlike honeybees, native pollinator species have received little attention. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the bioinsecticide spinosad were assessed in the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata, an important native pollinator in the Neotropical region.

Imidacloprid also impaired worker respiration and overall group activity and flight, while spinosad significantly impaired only worker flight despite exhibiting higher oral toxicity to adult workers than imidacloprid.

Results indicated that the 48-h oral LD50 of imidacloprid is between 41 and >81 ng per bee, and the contact LD50 between 49 and 102 ng per bee. The ingested amount of imidacloprid-containing sucrose solution decreased with increasing imidacloprid concentrations and may be attributed to dose-related sub-lethal intoxication symptoms or to antifeedant responses. Some previously reported imidacloprid metabolites occurring at low levels in planta after seed dressing, ie olefine-, 5-OH- and 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, showed lower oral LD50 values (>36, >49 and 159ng per bee, respectively) compared with the concurrently tested parent molecule (41ng per bee). The urea metabolite and 6-chloronicotinic acid (6-CNA) exhibited LD50 values of >99 500 and >121 500ng per bee, respectively. The pharmacological profile of the [3H]imidacloprid binding site in honeybee head membrane preparations is consistent with that anticipated for a nAChR. IC50 values for the displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by several metabolites such as olefine, 5-OH-, 4,5-OH-imidacloprid, urea and 6-CNA were 0.45, 24, 6600, > 100 000, and > 100 000nM, respectively. Displacement of [3H]imidacloprid by imidacloprid revealed an IC50 value of 2.9nM, thus correlating well with the observed acute oral toxicity of the compounds in honeybees. Neurons isolated from the antennal lobe of A mellifera and subjected to whole-cell voltage clamp electrophysiology responded to the application of 100 ŒºM acetylcholine with a fast inward current of between 30 and 1600 pA at -70mV clamp potential. Imidacloprid and two of the metabolites (olefine- and 5-OH-imidacloprid) acted agonistically on these neurons, whereas the others did not induce currents at test conencentrations up to 3 mM.

Honey bees get exposed to systemic pesticides while foraging in contaminated fields, and it is important to know the toxicity (LD50) and evaluate the impacts of bees' exposure to these molecules. Fipronil and imidacloprid are systemic pesticides widely used in Brazil and other countries. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50 (24 hours) and evaluate motor changes in Africanized honey bee foragers exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of fipronil and imidacloprid. To determine the LD50, foraging honey bees were exposed by ingestion and contact to five doses of fipronil (Regent 800WG¬∞) and imidacloprid (Appalus 200SC¬∞) insecticides. After 24 hours of exposure, the number of dead bees was counted, and the results were subjected to probit analysis. The motor activity of bees exposed by ingestion or contact to LD50 and sublethal doses (1/500th of the LD50) of both pesticides was assessed 4 hours after exposure using a behavioral observation box. The ingestion and contact with LD50 of fipronil were 0.0528¬±0.0090 and 0.0054¬±0.0041 Œºg/bee, respectively; the ingestion and contact with LD50 of imidacloprid were 0.0809¬±0.0135 and 0.0626¬±0.0080 Œºg/bee, respectively.

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT50s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

Toxicity data are submitted to support these assessments and the USEPA maintains a large database containing acute and chronic toxicity data on adult and larval honey bees (Apis mellifera), which USEPA considers a surrogate for Apis and non-Apis bees. We compared these toxicity data to explore possible trends. This analysis indicated a significant correlation between acute contact and oral median lethal dose (LD50) values for adult honey bees (œÅ = 0.74, p <0.0001). Using default EPA modeling assumptions, where exposure for an individual bee is roughly 12x lower through contact than through ingestion, the analysis indicates that the oral LD50 is similarly if not more protective of the contact LD50 for the majority of pesticides and modes of action evaluated. The analysis also provided evidence that compounds with a lower acute toxicity for adults through contact and oral exposure pathways may still be acutely toxic for larvae. The acute toxicity of herbicides and fungicides was higher for larvae relative to oral and contact toxicity for adult honey bees for the same compounds and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) from chronic toxicity studies were lower for larvae relative to adults, indicating increased sensitivity of larvae. When comparing 8-day LD50 values between single dose larval acute studies to those derived from repeat dose 22-day larval chronic toxicity studies, the LD50 values derived from chronic studies were significantly lower than those from acute toxicity tests (Z = -37, p = 0.03).

After determination of the median lethal doses (LD50), honeybees were exposed at doses of 5.07 ng/bee and 2.53 ng/bee for deltamethrin, 0.58 ng/bee and 0.29 ng/bee for fipronil, and 4.71 ng/bee and 2.36 ng/bee for spinosad (equivalent to 1/10th [LD50/10] and 1/20th [LD50/20] of the LD50, respectively).

The results showed that deltamethrin, fipronil, and spinosad modulated these biomarkers differentially. For the enzyme involved in the defense against oxidative stress, fipronil and spinosad induced CAT activity. For the remaining enzymes, 3 response profiles were identified. First, exposure to deltamethrin induced slight effects and modulated only CaE-1 and CaE-2, with opposite effects. Second, spinosad exhibited an induction profile for most of the biomarkers, except AChE. Third, fipronil did not modulate AChE, CaE-2, or GST, increased CAT and CaE-1, and decreased ALP.

Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24¬†h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance.

Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to dinotefuran at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and pymetrozine were relatively less toxic to bees (<25¬†% mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera.

Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals. ¬© 2014, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",2015///,2015,10.1007/s13592-014-0315-0,46.0,2,177,193,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924804372&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-014-0315-0&partnerID=40&md5=b92a75225834cd31b12b51adcbd27850,Scopus,,,,,,1,35,0,

Acute dermal toxicity tests by applying thiamethoxam solution (pL) dissolved in acetone on the dorsal side of thoracic region revealed median lethal dose (dermal; 24 h) as 93.97 ng g-1 against A. mellifera where as, for A. c. cerana, it was 86.51 ng g-1 with corresponding log likelihood ratio as 1.40 showing that both the values were at par with each other. In oral toxicity studies, starved honey bee foragers were fed with various concentrations of thiamethoxam in 50% sucrose water solution. Median lethal toxicity values at 24 h against A. mellifera and A. c. cerana were 67.61 and 31.43 ng g-1, respectively. The log likelihood value of 2.78 showed there exists a significant difference among the two values i.e. A. c. cerana was more susceptible (Sensitivity ratio = 2.51) to thiamethoxam than A. mellifera.

Most studies that have investigated the effects of pesticides on honey bees have focused on the European honey bee (Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)), which is commonly domesticated worldwide. However, the Asian honey bee (Apis cerana) is widely distributed throughout Asia, and toxicity data are lacking for this species. This study aimed to fill this important knowledge gap. In this study, we determined the acute contact toxicity in A. cerana to various pesticides, including neonicotinoids, fipronil, organophosphorus, synthetic pyrethroids, carbamate, and anthranilic diamide. Based on the test duration of 48 h of contact LD50 tests, A. cerana was most sensitive to dinotefuran (0.0014 lg/bee), followed by thiamethoxam (0.0024 lg/bee) and fipronil (0.0025 lg/bee). Dinotefuran is used extensively in Asia, thereby potentially creating a substantial hazard. More generally, A. cerana was approximately one order of magnitude more sensitive than was A. mellifera to most of the pesticides evaluated. The results of our study suggest that neonicotinoid pesticides should not be considered as a single group that acts uniformly on all honey bees, and that more careful management strategies are required to conserve A. cerana populations than A. mellifera.  ¬© The Authors 2017.",2017///,2017,10.1093/jee/tox032,110.0,2,447,452,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038610300&doi=10.1093%2fjee%2ftox032&partnerID=40&md5=03907053c2465de8a51045f432d7d25e,Scopus,,,,,,1,38,0,

Due to wild bee sensitivity data shortage, it is unclear if the honey bee Apis mellifera is a suitable surrogate species in the current EU risk assessment scheme. Furthermore, the underlying causes for sensitivity differences in bees are not established. We assessed the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of dimethoate towards multiple bee species, generated a species sensitivity distribution and derived a hazardous dose (HD5). Furthermore, we performed a regression analysis with body weight and dimethoate toxicity. HD5 lower 95% confidence limit was equal to honey bee mean LD50 when applying a safety factor of 10. Body weight proved to be a predictor of interspecific bee sensitivity but did not explain the pattern completely. Using acute toxicity values from honey bees and a safety factor of 10 seems to cover the interspecific sensitivity range of bees in the case of dimethoate. Acute endpoints of proposed additional test species, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris and the red mason bee Osmia bicornis, do not improve the risk assessment for the entire group.

Recently, populations of honey bees have been declining due to a combination of factors, including the widespread use of agricultural pesticides. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the acute oral toxicity of different formulated pesticides to honey bee adults. In particular, we assessed the acute oral toxicity of two neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, Assail 30SG and thiamethoxam, Actara 25WDG) and two other systemic insecticide products (sulfoxaflor, Closer 2SC and flupyradifurone, Sivanto 200SL), all of which are generally used in pest management programs in commercial apple orchards in the Eastern United States. Honey bees were fed a range of doses of each pesticide in order to create a response curve, and LC50, LC90, and LD50 values were determined. The pesticide formulation containing flupyradifurone as the active ingredient was found to be the least toxic to honey bees followed by the formulations containing sulfoxaflor and acetamiprid.

The nitro-substituted compounds were the most toxic to the honey bee in our laboratory studies with LD50 values of 18ng/bee for imidacloprid, 22ng for clothianidin, 30ng for thiamethoxam, 75ng for dinotefuran and 138ng for nitenpyram. The cyano-substituted neonicotinoids exhibited a much lower toxicity with LD50 values for acetamiprid and thiacloprid of 7.1 and 14.6Œºg/bee, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, triflumizole and propiconazole increased honey bee toxicity of acetamiprid 6.0-, 244- and 105-fold and thiacloprid 154-, 1,141- and 559-fold, respectively, but had a minimal effect on imidacloprid (1.70, 1.85 and 1.52-fold, respectively). The acetamiprid metabolites, N-demethyl acetamiprid, 6-chloro-3-pyridylmethanol and 6-chloro-nicotinic acid when applied topically, produced no mortality at 50Œºg/bee. These results suggest that P450s are an important mechanism for acetamiprid and thiacloprid detoxification and their low toxicity to honey bees. When honey bees were placed in cages in forced contact with alfalfa treated with acetamiprid and the synergist, triflumizole, in combination at their maximum recommended application rates, no mortality was detected above that of the control. ¬© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

293,573,JOUR,Toxicity and poisoning symptoms of selected insecticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera mellifera L.),"['Pashte, V.V.', 'Patil, C.S.']",Archives of Biological Sciences,"Bees are potential pollinators of wide variety of crops. The European dark bee, Apis mellifera mellifera (L.) is widely used for crop pollination. However, pesticide usage in modern agriculture has threatened the plant-bee pollinator interaction. There is lack of data regarding lethal time, insecticide concentration and poisoning symptoms, especially for formulated insecticides that are widely used in insect management. This study shows that the intrinsic toxicity of insecticides (LC50) to A. mellifera mellifera (L.) was in the following order: imidacloprid (0.0070) > fipronil (0.0125) > indoxacarb (0.0266) > cypermethrin (0.0370) > dimethoate (0.0385). The lethal time (LT50) values (h) in the ascending order of toxicity of insecticides were as follows: fipronil (6.56), cypermethrin (6.69), dimethoate (8.00), imidacloprid (9.85) and indoxacarb (13.45). Distinct poisoning symptoms observed in A. mellifera mellifera were extended proboscis, expanded wings, unhooked wings, extended legs and twisted bodies, defecation on cage covers, sting in release-out position and anus with excreta. All the tested pesticides are harmful to the honey bee except azadirachtin. The tested pesticides exhibited different poisoning symptoms in bees, which could be useful for beekeepers in identifying the cause of colony mortality. In conclusion, the pesticide toxicological research on bees is an important safety aspect for beneficial organisms. This study reveals a realistic acute toxicity in the field of commonly used insecticides.

This species is commercially produced primarily for greenhouse crop pollination and is a common and abundant component of the wild bumblebee fauna in agricultural, suburban and urban landscapes. However, there is a dearth of pesticide toxicity information about North American bumblebees. The present study determined the acute oral lethal toxicity (48-h LD50) of: the butenolide, flupyradifurone (>1.7 Œºg/bee); the diamide, cyantraniliprole (>0.54 Œºg/bee); the neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam (0.0012 Œºg/bee); and the sulfoximine, sulfoxaflor (0.0177 Œºg/bee). Compared with published honey bee (Apis mellifera) LD50 values, the present study shows that sulfoxaflor and thiamethoxam are 8.3√ó and 3.3√ó more acutely toxic to B. impatiens, whereas flupyradifurone is more acutely toxic to A. mellifera. The current rule of thumb for toxicity extrapolation beyond the honey bee as a model species, termed 10√ó safety factor, may be sufficient for bumblebee acute oral toxicity. A comparison of five risk assessment equations suggested that the Standard Risk Approach (SRA) and Fixed Dose Risk Approach (FDRA) provide more nuanced levels of risk evaluation compared to the Exposure Toxicity Ratio (ETR), Hazard Quotient (HQ), and Risk Quotient (RQ), primarily because the SRA and FDRA take into account real world variability in pollen and nectar pesticide residues and the chances that bees may be exposed to them. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133771,295.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85124092732&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.133771&partnerID=40&md5=e8fd9e84f38ffb9a0828a8dcd30a93fe,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'human', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'pesticide', 'pollen', 'Pollination', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'Food products', 'sugar', 'adult', 'thiamethoxam', 'Eco-toxicology', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'nectar', 'mortality', 'Honey bee', 'Plant Nectar', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'male', 'LD50', 'bioassay', 'limit of quantitation', 'drug toxicity', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'Bombus impatiens', 'electrospray', 'North America', 'humidity', 'Bumble bee', 'cyantraniliprole', 'greenhouse', 'Non-Apis bees', 'human experiment', 'Safety factor', 'Eastern Canada', 'heuristics', 'Non-apis bee', 'Non-target exposure', 'pharmacokinetic parameters', 'Pollinator ecotoxicology', 'Risk approaches']",,,,,1,43,0,

Increased insecticide use and the introduction of new insecticide classes have been proposed as factors contributing to these declines. Previous studies have demonstrated contact toxicity of single active ingredient insecticides to honey bees. However, the field realistic contact toxicity of formulated (pre-mix) insecticide mixtures containing multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to honey bees has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we simulate whole body contact to spray applications made at low label recommended field rates of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram to honey bees under three realistic scenarios in field crops: (1) continuous exposure, (2) spray-only exposure, and (3) residual exposure. A customized spray tower in a laboratory setting was used to apply insecticides at the lowest recommended dose in the Environmental Protection Agency regulated label of each insecticide. Acute toxicity was determined by screening resulting mortality up to 96-hours post treatment. Mortality varied significantly between treatments at all evaluation periods for all experiments except residual exposure. For continuous and spray-only exposure, thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin resulted in 80‚Äì90% mortality at 48-hours, while at 96-hours we observed close to complete mortality for all treatments. This difference in mortality onset between treatments highlights the importance of extended observation beyond the 48-hours recommended by the USDA-EPA.

During their lifetime bumblebees are regularly challenged by various environmental stressors including insecticides. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an 'indicator' species for 'standard' ecotoxicological testing, but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other eusocial or solitary bees. To investigate this, the susceptibility of B. terrestris to selected pesticides within the neonicotinoid, pyrethroid and organophosphate classes was examined using acute insecticide bioassays. Acute oral and topical LD50 values for B. terrestris against these insecticides were broadly consistent with published results for A. mellifera. For the neonicotinoids, imidacloprid was highly toxic, but thiacloprid and acet-amiprid were practically non-toxic. For pyrethroids, deltamethrin was highly toxic, but tau-fluvalinate only slightly toxic. For the organophosphates, chlorpyrifos was highly toxic, but coumaphos practically non-toxic. Bioassays using insecticides with common synergists enhanced the sensitivity of B. terrestris to several insecticides, suggesting detoxification enzymes may provide a level of protection against these compounds. The sensitivity of B. terrestris to compounds within three different insecticide classes is similar to that reported for honey bees, with marked variation in sensitivity to different insecticides within the same insecticide class observed in both species.

However, there is an ongoing decline of wild and domesticated bee species. Since agricultural pesticide use is a key driver of this process, there is a need for a protective risk assessment. To achieve a more protective registration process, two bee species, Osmia bicornis/Osmia cornuta and Bombus terrestris, were proposed by the European Food Safety Authority as additional test surrogates to the honey bee Apis mellifera. We investigated the acute toxicity (median lethal dose, LD50) of multiple commercial insecticide formulations towards the red mason bee (O. bicornis) and compared these values to honey bee regulatory endpoints. In two thirds of all cases, O. bicornis was less sensitive than the honey bee. By applying an assessment factor of 10 on the honey bee endpoint, a protective level was achieved for 87% (13 out 15) of all evaluated products. Our results show that O. bicornis is rarely an adequate additional surrogate species for lower tier risk assessment since it is less sensitive than the honey bee for the majority of investigated products. Given the currently limited database on bee species sensitivity, the honey bee seems sufficiently protective in acute scenarios as long as a reasonable assessment factor is applied.

Therefore, we assessed the acute topical toxicity and generated LD50 values for three insecticides: Dimethoate (62.08 ng a.i./bee), permethrin (50.01 ng a.i./bee), and imidacloprid (12.82 ng a.i/bee). The variation in the mass of individual bees had a significant but small effect on these toxicity estimates. Overall, the toxicity of these insecticides to M. rotundata were within the 10- fold safety factor currently used with A. mellifera toxicity estimates from tier I trials to estimate risk to other bee species.

Considering the potential threat of pesticide poisoning, the indigenous Saudi bee Apis mellifera jemenitica is susceptible to the risks associated with acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This study investigates the acetamiprid-induced effects on the survival, olfactory learning, and memory formation of A. m. jemenitica through two exposure routes: topical application and oral ingestion. Field-realistic and serially diluted concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 10 ppm) of acetamiprid led to notable mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment, with peak mortality observed at 24 h and 48 h for both exposure routes. Bee mortality was concentration-dependent, increasing with the rising concentration of acetamiprid at the tested time intervals. Food consumption following oral exposure exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern, steadily decreasing with increasing concentrations of acetamiprid. Oral exposure resulted in a substantially higher cumulative mortality (55%) compared to topical exposure (15%), indicating a significant disparity in bee mortality between the two exposure routes. The 24 h post-treatment LC50 values for acetamiprid were 160.33 and 12.76 ppm for topical application and oral ingestion, respectively. The sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of acetamiprid were 15.23, 34.18, and 61.20 ppm, respectively, following topical exposure, and 2.85, 4.77, and 6.91 ppm, respectively, following oral exposure. The sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid significantly decreased learning during the 2nd‚Äì3rd conditioning trials and impaired memory formation at 2, 12, and 24 h following both topical and oral exposure routes, compared to the control bees. Notably, the sublethal concentrations were equally effective in impairing bee learning and memory. Taken together, acetamiprid exposure adversely affected bee survival, hindered learning, and impaired the memory retention of learned tasks. ¬© 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/insects15070473,15.0,7,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199863877&doi=10.3390%2finsects15070473&partnerID=40&md5=5904bd7c130a5053326e3c2a0133b7ad,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'memory', 'toxicity', 'mortality', 'honey bee', 'cognitive skills', 'lethal toxicity', 'olfactory cue', 'oral routes', 'topical routes']",,,,,1,53,0,

Multiple anthropogenic pressures may be exacerbating pollinator declines. One key pressure is exposure to chemicals including pesticides and other contaminants. Historically the honey bee (Apis mellifera spp.) has been used as an ‚Äòindicator‚Äô species for ‚Äòstandard‚Äô ecotoxicological testing but it has been suggested that it is not always a good proxy for other types of eusocial and solitary bees because of species differences in autecology and sensitivity to various stressors. We developed a common toxicity test system to conduct acute and chronic exposures of up to 240 h of similar doses of seven chemicals, targeting different metabolic pathways, on three bee species (Apis mellifera spp., Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis). We compared the relative sensitivity between species in terms of potency between the chemicals and the influence of exposure time on toxicity. While there were significant interspecific differences that varied through time, overall the magnitude of these differences (in terms of treatment effect ratios) was generally comparable (< 2 fold) although there were some large divergences from this pattern. Our results suggest that A. mellifera spp. could be used as a proxy for other bee species provided a reasonable assessment factor is used to cover interspecific variation. Perhaps more importantly our results show significant and large time dependency of toxicity across all three tested species that greatly exceeds species differences (> 25 fold within test). These are rarely considered in standard regulatory testing but may have severe environmental consequences, especially when coupled with the likelihood of differential species exposures in the wild. These insights indicate that further work is required to understand how differences in toxicokinetics vary between species and mixtures of chemicals. ¬© 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.10.180,578.0,,357,365,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85003945078&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2016.10.180&partnerID=40&md5=27dbf2fadaa31b8528499be468059918,Scopus,,,,,,1,54,0,

Further studies showed that the scale of increase in toxicity was fungicide dose dependent with greater synergy of oral toxicity of thiamethoxam following contact dosing with propiconazole.

Among them, exposure to neonicotinoids has been getting more attention and has been considered as a main stressor. The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and Chinese indigenous honey bee (Apis cerana F.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are two managed honey bee species in China. These two species are widely used in beekeeping, and many wild A. cerana is widely spread in forests and contributes to the ecosystem. It is predicated that A. cerana is more sensitive to insecticides than A. mellifera due to their smaller mass. Here, we found that although the body mass of A. cerana is significantly lower than A. mellifera, the sensitivity of the two species to neonicotinoids are not associated with their body mass but depended on the chemical structure of neonicotinoids. To dinotefuran, the two species showed the similar sensitivity. To acetamiprid, A. mellifera was less sensitive than A. cerana. However, to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, A. mellifera was more sensitive than A. cerana. These results suggested that the sensitivity of honey bees to neonicotinoids is closely associated with the structure of pesticides, but not with body mass of bees. It is also indicated that the hazards of pesticides to the different pollinators could not be inferred from one species to another. ¬© 2017 The Author(s) 2017.

This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI).

Clothianidin and to a lesser extent imidacloprid were highly toxic to all three species, deltamethrin and spinosad were intermediate in toxicity, and novaluron was nontoxic.

Laboratory assessment of direct contact toxicity, although useful, is only one measure of potential impact, and mortality under field conditions may differ greatly depending on management practices.

The toxicity of several pesticides to O. lignaria and other Osmia species has been previously reported. However, the field-realistic toxicity of formulated premix insecticides comprised of multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to O. lignaria has not been assessed. Here, we use a customized spray tower in a laboratory setting to assess adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to four formulated pesticide mixtures: thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin (TLC), imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin (IBC), chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin (CLC) and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram (MS) by directly spraying anesthetized bees in Petri dishes. Sepa-rately, adult male and female whole-body direct contact exposure to formulated imidacloprid (I), beta-cyfluthrin (BC) and their 1:1 binary combination (IBC) was assessed using the same experimental method. Resulting mortality in each study was screened up to 96 h post-treatment to determine acute whole-body contact toxicity. In the first study, TLC and IBC resulted in statistically higher mortality at 24 and 48 h than the two other insecticide combinations tested. The CLC and MS combinations were slower acting and the highest mortality for O. lignaria exposed to these mixtures was recorded at 96 h. We did observe significant differences in toxicity between CLC and MS. In the second study, exposure to the 1:1 binary combination of IBC caused overall significantly higher mortality than exposure to I or BC alone. Both active ingredients alone, however, demonstrated equivalent levels of mortality to the 1:1 binary combination treatment at the 96 h observation reading, indicating increased speed of kill, but not necessarily increased toxicity. Significant differences in the onset of mortality following acute contact whole-body exposure to the formulated insecticide mixtures and individual active ingredients tested were consistently observed across all experiments in both studies. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Acetamiprid and endosulfan did not cause any repellent effect on honey bees in the field trials endorse the usage of acetamiprid against sucking pest in flowering plants. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2015///,2015,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.07.039,119.0,,668,674,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84919742448&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2014.07.039&partnerID=40&md5=1decf292ff2baac133602f9f568648e3,Scopus,,,,,,1,61,0,

These insecticides, however, show very strong toxicity to pollinating insects and in particular to the honey bee, besides causing also other effects which are often not easily identifiable, such as behavioural disturbances, orientation difficulties, and impairment of social activities. During the past few years, in many countries, alarming bee mortality rates were recorded. In some cases this was clearly due to the use of neonicotinoids either for seed dressing or crop spraying. It was therefore considered appropriate to test on three strains of Apis mellifera of Piedmontese origin and referable to A. in. ligustica in the laboratory both the acute oral toxicity of Imidacloprid, which had been, in use for many years, and Clothianidin and Thiametoxam, only more recently introduced in Italy. To reach this aim, methods developed at the Di.Va.P.R.A. and applied in several previous studies, were used. Commercial products were used throughout the tests. They were tested at the recommended concentration for field treatments. When mortality was higher in the tested bees than in the untreated ones, the active ingredients were tested at gradually decreasing concentrations so as to reach a mortality not significantly different from that found in the untreated controls. The LD(50) calculated for Clothianidin and Thiametoxam were lower than for imidacloprid; the differences between the honey bee strains for the same active ingredient were slight.",2010///,2010,,93.0,,99,102,,,,0370-4327,WOS:000287280700012,,,1,62,0,

The economic contribution of the insect‚Äôs pollinators to world agriculture is estimated at billions of dollars. However, non-judicious choice of pesticides and absence of good plant protection practices, represent a real danger to bees. The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of three insecticides commonly used in cotton protection on bees Apis mellifera adansonii in Benin. Materials and Methods: In this context, bees were taken from hives and transported to the laboratory. Active ingredients and different doses used were as followed: Emamectin benzoate, beta-cyfluthrin+imidacloprid and lamdex+chlorpyrifos at doses of: 2150 nanograms per bee, 125 nanograms per bee, 75, 50, 25, 12.5√ó103, 6, 2.5 and 1.25-0.96 ng per bee, depending on the active ingredient. Each treatment included three replications consisting of 25 bees. Bees were anaesthetized with ether before treatment. Each bee received by topical application on the pronotum, 1 ŒºL of the formulation. Results: Observations were made after 2, 10, 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that, even the lowest doses of the pesticides: 0.96, 7.25 and 21.5 ng per b showed mortality higher than 90% to bees, 48 h after application. An insecticide with active ingredients including beta-cyfluthrin (45 g L‚Äì1), which is a pyrethroid and Imidacloprid (100 g L‚Äì1), a neonicotinoid actually forbidden in many European countries showed very high toxicity to honey bees, indicating values of the LD50 varying from 19.9 ng per bee for 10 h exposure to 1.1√ó10‚Äì2 ng per bee for 18 h and 5√ó10‚Äì4 ng per bee for 36 h. Conclusion: Results of the study indicated the urgent need of good plant protection practices in the frame of sustainable agriculture and bee‚Äôs preservation and conservation. Promotion of strategies as part of the dissemination of good agricultural practices in plant protection is a guarantee which should ensure sustainable agriculture and environmental, human and biodiversity protection. These studies showed the urgency of the integrated plant protection in order to promote good agricultural practices for honey bee‚Äôs protection. ¬© 2016 Deo Gracias Zoclanclounon et al.",2016///,2016,10.3923/je.2016.161.169,13.0,05-Jun,161,169,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84991730426&doi=10.3923%2fje.2016.161.169&partnerID=40&md5=f44798c0db3a1f50c059a34cf4d7bb24,Scopus,,,,,,1,63,0,

However, honey bees are usually exposed to pesticide mixtures under field conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of individual pesticides and mixtures of clothianidin (CLO) with eight other pesticides [carbaryl (CAR), thiodicarb (THI), chlorpyrifos (CHL), beta-cyfluthrin (BCY), gamma-cyhalothrin (GCY), tetraconazole (TET), spinosad (SPI) and indoxacarb (IND)] on honey bees using a feeding method. Toxicity tests of a 4-day exposure to individual pesticides revealed that CLO had the highest toxicity to A. mellifera, with an LC50 value of 0.24 Œºg a.i. mL-1, followed by IND and CHL with LC50 values of 3.40 and 3.56 Œºg a.i. mL-1, respectively. SPI and CAR had relatively low toxicities, with LC50 values of 7.19 and 8.42 Œºg a.i. mL-1, respectively. In contrast, TET exhibited the least toxicity, with an LC50 value of 258.7 Œºg a.i. mL-1. Most binary mixtures of CLO with other pesticides exerted additive and antagonistic effects. However, all the ternary mixtures containing CLO and TET (except for CLO+TET+THD) elicited synergistic responses to bees. Either increased numbers of components in the mixture or/and a unique mode of action appeared to be responsible for the higher toxicity of mixtures.

In the current study, the single and combined toxicity of clothianidin, dinotefuran, and thiamethoxam to honeybees was examined after 48 h exposure by the acute oral method and combination index (CI)-isobologram equation.

Recent evidence indicated honeybee health might be posed a potential threat by widely used neonicotinoids worldwide. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of these insecticides in honeybees especially at an enantiomeric level. In this study, we selected two species of bees, Apis mellifera (A. mellifera) and Apis cerana (A. cerana), to assess the toxicity and molecular mechanism of neonicotinoid dinotefuran and its enantiomers. The results showed that S-dinotefuran was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran and R-dinotefuran to honeybees by oral and contact exposures as much as 114 times. A. cerana was more susceptible to highly toxic enantiomer S-dinotefuran. S-dinotefuran induced the immune system response in A. cerana after 48 h exposure and significant changes were observed in the neuronal signaling of A. mellifera under three forms of dinotefuran exposure. Moreover, molecular docking also revealed that S-dinotefuran formed more hydrogen bonds than R-dinotefuran with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, indicating the higher toxicity of S-dinotefuran.

To assess acute toxicity against the honey bee, we used a modified spray tower to simulate field spray conditions to include direct whole-body exposure, inhalation, and continuing tarsal contact and oral licking after a field spray. A total of 42 formulated pesticides, including one herbicide and one fungicide, were assayed for acute spray toxicity to 4-6-d-old workers. Results showed significantly variable toxicities among pesticides, with LC50s ranging from 25 to thousands of mg/liter. Further risk assessment using the field application concentration to LC1 or LC99 ratios revealed the risk potential of the 42 pesticides. Three pesticides killed less than 1% of the worker bees, including the herbicide, a miticide, and a neonicotinoid. Twenty-six insecticides killed more than 99% of the bees, including commonly used organophosphates and neonicotinoids.

In the current study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honeybee larvae in vitro and explored the mechanism of toxicity. The results showed that the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of S-dinotefuran to honeybee larvae was 30.0 Œºg/larva after oral exposure for 72 h, which was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran (92.7 Œºg/larva) and R-dinotefuran (183.6 Œºg/larva). Although the acute toxicity of the three forms of dinotefuran to larvae was lower than that to adults, chronic exposure significantly reduced larval survival, larval weight, and weight of newly emerged adults. Analysis of gene expression and hormone titer indicated that dinotefuran affects larval growth and development by interfering with nutrient digestion and absorption and the molting system. Analysis of hemolymph metabolome further revealed that disturbances in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and energy metabolism are the key mechanisms of dinotefuran toxicity to bee larvae. In addition, melatonin and vitellogenin are used by larvae to cope with dinotefuran-induced oxidative stress.

Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood.

In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L‚àí1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L‚àí1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators. Meanwhile, the activities of SOD, caspase 3, caspase 9, and PPO, as well as the expressions of six genes (abaecin, dorsal-2, defensin-2, vtg, caspase-1, and CYP6AS14) associated with oxidative stress, immune response, lifespan, cell apoptosis, and detoxification metabolism were noteworthily varied in the individual and mixture challenges than at the baseline level.

304,584,JOUR,A new method to assess the acute toxicity toward honeybees of the abrasion particles generated from seeds coated with insecticides,"['Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Girolami, V', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE,"Background Large amounts of insecticide-containing dusts produced from abrasion of the seed dressing can be released into the atmosphere during sowing operations. Neonicotinoid pesticides, introduced in the 1990s for several crops, are the leading products for seed-coating treatments in many countries. Neonicotinoid containing dusts can be effectively intercepted by bees in flight over the sowing field, inducing lethal acute effects, so that restrictions in the use of the main neonicotinoids have been adopted in the European Union. This led to the consequent introduction of replacement insecticides for seed-coating, i.e. methiocarb and thiacloprid, despite the lack of information on both the toxicity and the exposure scenarios for honeybees. Results In this study, a laboratory apparatus was developed in order to quantify the toxicity of the dusts produced from the abrasion of the seed coating. This quantification is based on (i) an airstream transporting coating particles into an exposure chamber; (ii) exposure of bees to reproducible and measurable concentrations of insecticide, and (iii) direct measurement of the exposure dose on single bees. The method allowed us to perform in vivo experiments of honeybee exposure to provide toxicity data in more realistic exposure conditions. In fact, the formulation rather than the active principle alone can be tested, and the exposure is through dusts rather than a solution so that specific absorption behavior can be studied in representative environmental conditions. The method was used to quantify the acute toxicity (LD50) of dusts obtained from the abrasion of corn seeds coated with clothianidin, thiacloprid and methiocarb. Conclusions Our results show that, surprisingly, the replacement insecticide methiocarb has a toxicity (LD50 = 421-693 ng/bee) in the same order of magnitude as clothianidin (LD50 = 113-451 ng/bee) through this specific exposure route, while thiacloprid (LD50 = 16.9 center dot 10(3) ng/bee) has a significantly lower acute toxicity. Moreover, dusts containing methiocarb and clothianidin show a significant increase in toxicity when, after exposure, bees are kept under high humidity conditions. This suggests that the method here presented can be used to obtain complementary toxicity data in the risk assessment procedure for the authorization of new seed-coating insecticides or new formulations.",2020/07/06/,2020,10.1186/s12302-020-00372-z,32.0,1,,,,,"['ecotoxicology', 'Neonicotinoids', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'clothianidin', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'pesticide residue', 'thiacloprid', 'Acute toxicity', 'coating', 'maize', 'seed', 'sowing', 'Zea mays', 'toxicity test', 'Honeybees', 'Seed coating', 'abrasion', 'Abrasion dusts', 'Exposure measurement', 'Methiocarb', 'Pollinator insects', 'Systemic insecticides']",2190-4707,WOS:000545648100001,,,1,77,0,

Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 ¬µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells.

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees.

Existing mixture toxicity modelling approaches, such as the models of concentration addition and independent action and the mechanistic DEBtox framework have been previously shown as valuable tools for understanding and ultimately predicting joint toxicity. Here we apply these mixture models to investigate the potential to interpret the effects of semi-chronic binary mixture exposure for three bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis within potentiation and mixture toxicity experiments. In the potentiation studies, the effect of the insecticide dimethoate with added propiconazole fungicide and neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin with added tau-fluvalinate pyrethroid acari-cide showed no difference in toxicity compared to the single chemical alone. Clothianidin toxicity showed a small scale, but temporally conserved increase in exposure conducted in the presence of propiconazole, particularly for B. terrestris and O. bicornis, the latter showing a near three-fold increase in clothianidin toxicity in the presence of propiconazole. In the mixture toxicity studies, the dominant response patterns were of additivity, however, binary mixtures of clothianidin and dimethoate in A. mellifera, B. terrestris and male O. bicornis there was evidence of a predominant antagonistic interaction. Given the ubiquitous nature of exposures to multiple chemicals, there is an urgent need to consider mixture effects in pollinator risk assessments. Our analyses suggest that current models, particularly those that utilise time-series data, such as DEBtox, can be used to identify additivity as the dominant response pattern and also those examples of interactions, even when small-scale, that may need to be taken into account during risk assessment. ¬© 2017 Robinson et al.

193,473,JOUR,Biphasic concentration-dependent interaction between imidacloprid and dietary phytochemicals in honey bees (Apis mellifera),"['Wong, M.J.', 'Liao, L.-H.', 'Berenbaum, M.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Background The presence of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid in nectar, honey, pollen, beebread and beeswax has been implicated in declines worldwide in the health of the western honey bee Apis mellifera. Certain phytochemicals, including quercetin and p-coumaric acid, are ubiquitous in the honey bee diet and are known to upregulate cytochrome P450 genes encoding enzymes that detoxify insecticides. Thus, the possibility exists that these dietary phytochemicals interact with ingested imidacloprid to ameliorate toxicity by enhancing its detoxification. Approach Quercetin and p-coumaric acid were incorporated in a phytochemical-free artificial diet individually and together along with imidacloprid at a range of field-realistic concentrations. In acute toxicity bioassays, honey bee 24-and 48-hour imidacloprid LC50 values were determined in the presence of the phytochemicals. Additionally, chronic toxicity bioassays were conducted using varying concentrations of imidacloprid in diets with the phytochemicals to test impacts of phytochemicals on longevity. Results In acute toxicity bioassays, the phytochemicals had no effect on imidacloprid LC50 values. In chronic toxicity longevity bioassays, phytochemicals enhanced honey bee survival at low imidacloprid concentrations (15 and 45 ppb) but had a negative effect at higher concentrations (105 ppb and 135 ppb). p-Coumaric acid alone increased honey bee longevity at concentrations of 15 and 45 ppb imidacloprid (hazard ratio (HR): 0.83 and 0.70, respectively). Quercetin alone and in combination with p-coumaric acid similarly enhanced longevity at 45 ppb imidacloprid (HR:0.81 and HR:0.77, respectively). However, p-coumaric acid in combination with 105 ppb imidacloprid and quercetin in combination with 135 ppb imidacloprid increased honey bee HR by approximately 30% (HR:1.33 and HR:1.30, respectively). Conclusions The biphasic concentration-dependent response of honey bees to imidacloprid in the presence of two ubiquitous dietary phytochemicals indicates that there are limits to the protective effects of the natural diet of honey bees against neonicotinoids based on their own inherent toxicity. ¬© 2018 Wong et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",2018///,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0206625,13.0,11,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055913454&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0206625&partnerID=40&md5=6bc8adf41daeac66b0b0bc0638b06f71,Scopus,,,,,,1,85,0,

Spinosad, which is synthesized from the fermentation process produced by the soil actinomycete Saccharopolyspora spinosa, is one of the most used bioinsecticides today. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of spinosad (formulation) on survival, general group activity and the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in two organs (midgut and brain) of workers of Partamona helleri, after 24 h of oral exposure. Workers were orally exposed to different concentrations of spinosad. The concentration (8.16 x 10(-3) mg a.i./mL) that led to the mortality of approximately half the number of treated bees was considered LC50 and was used in behavior, histology and immunofluorescence bioassays. The results revealed that bee survival was substantially reduced with increasing spinosad concentrations. The LC50 of the bioinsecticide compromised general group activity, caused morphological alterations in the midgut and intensified the processes of autophagy, apoptosis and oxidative stress in this organ. The brain, on the other hand, did not present significant alterations under the tested conditions.

It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L‚àí1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L‚àí1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees. Our study also provides important guidance for the rational application of pesticide mixtures to protect pollinators in agricultural production effectively. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161700,870.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147246760&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.161700&partnerID=40&md5=9ac6a44f6016d8544a9e03a7c7b2a5c4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'adult', 'Honey bee', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicology', 'gene expression', 'male', 'thiacloprid', 'apoptosis', 'down regulation', 'Thiacloprid', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'fungicide', 'LC50', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'upregulation', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'Agriculture', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'synergism', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'biological marker', 'enzyme activity', 'occupational exposure', 'Population statistics', 'biomarker', 'physiological stress', 'innate immunity', 'Toxic effect', 'cyproconazole', 'Chemical contamination', 'homeostasis', 'signal transduction', 'Enzymes', 'working memory', 'cytochrome', 'enzyme', 'egg laying', 'Biomarker', 'theoretical study', 'Industrial poisons', 'Bee toxicology', 'Cyproconazole', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'lung function', 'Mixture effect', 'Mixture effects', 'Synergetic toxicity', 'Synergetics', 'toxicity assay']",,,,,1,87,0,
233,513,JOUR,Lethal and sublethal side-effect assessment supports a more benign profile of spinetoram compared with spinosad in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris,"['Besard, L.', 'Mommaerts, V.', 'Abdu-Alla, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to identify the potential side effects of the novel naturalyte insecticide spinetoram in comparison with spinosad on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. The potential lethal effects together with the ecologically relevant sublethal effects on aspects of bumblebee reproduction and foraging behaviour were evaluated. Bumblebee workers were exposed via direct contact with wet and dry residues under laboratory conditions to spinetoram at different concentrations, starting from the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) and then different dilutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10 000 of the MFRC), and compared with spinosad. In addition, the side effects via oral exposure in supplemented sugar water were assessed. RESULTS: Direct contact of B. terrestris workers with wet residues of spinosad and spinetoram showed spinetoram to be approximately 52 times less toxic than spinosad, while exposure to dry residues of spinetoram was about 8 times less toxic than exposure to those of spinosad. Oral treatment for 72 h (acute) indicated that spinetoram is about 4 times less toxic to B. terrestris workers compared with spinosad, while exposure for a longer period (i.e. 11 weeks) showed spinetoram to be 24 times less toxic. In addition, oral exposure to the two spinosyns resulted in detrimental sublethal effects on bumblebee reproduction. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for spinosad was 1/1000 of the MFRC, and 1/100 of the MFRC for spinetoram. Comparison between the chronic exposure bioassays assessing the sublethal effects on nest reproduction, with and without allowing for foraging behaviour, showed that the respective NOEC values for spinosad and spinetoram were similar over the two bioassays, indicating that there were no adverse effects by either spinosyn on the foraging of B. terrestris workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results indicate that the use of spinetoram is safer for bumblebees by direct contact and oral exposure than the use of spinosad, and therefore it can be applied safely in combination with B. terrestris. Another important conclusion is that the present data provide strong evidence that neither spinosyn has a negative effect on the foraging behaviour of these beneficial insects. However, before drawing final conclusions, spinetoram and spinosad should also be evaluated in more realistic field-related situations for the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour with the use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris. ¬© 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",2011///,2011,10.1002/ps.2093,67.0,5,541,547,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953744717&doi=10.1002%2fps.2093&partnerID=40&md5=9024a2303a41820a3bc0de393e80fa47,Scopus,,,,,,1,88,0,

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTSThe field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONSThe present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture.

Thus, the goal of this work was assess the toxic effects of thiamethoxam on newly emerged worker bees of Apis mellifera (africanized honeybee-AHB). Initially, we determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of thiamethoxam was 4.28 ng a.i./ŒºL of diet. To determine the lethal time 50 (LT50), a survival assay was conducted using diets containing sublethal doses of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 and 1/100 of the LC50. The group of bees exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 had a 41.2% reduction of lifespan. When AHB samples were analyzed by morphological technique we found the presence of condensed cells in the mushroom bodies and optical lobes in exposed honeybees. Through Xylidine Ponceau technique, we found cells which stained more intensely in groups exposed to thiamethoxam. The digestive and regenerative cells of the midgut from exposed bees also showed morphological and histochemical alterations, like cytoplasm vacuolization, increased apocrine secretion and increased cell elimination. Thus, intoxication with a sublethal doses of thiamethoxam can cause impairment in the brain and midgut of AHB and contribute to the honeybee lifespan reduction. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/tox.21842,29.0,10,1122,1133,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907866418&doi=10.1002%2ftox.21842&partnerID=40&md5=2b4d0e79e6f63b124c5e0f94b208277d,Scopus,,,,,,1,90,0,

The intensive use of insecticides from the neonicotinoids group is among the possible causal factors of this decline, including also sub-lethal effects. However, the use of synthetic insecticides has been increased on a global scale in the recent decades. In order to evaluate an alternative to the use of neonicotinoids, this work investigated the effects of a bioinsecticide and its major compound on A. mellifera (Apidae: Hymenoptera), one of the main pollinators of crop plants. For this, bees were exposed, by contact and ingestion, to the essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii (Poaceae: Poales), to geraniol (major compound) and the insecticide imidacloprid to evaluate the toxicity and behavioral effects as well as the locomotion changes and immune responses of bees treated with these compounds. In general, toxicity was greater through ingestion and the insecticide imidacloprid was more toxic to A. mellifera compared to the essential oil and its major compound. The individual and collective behaviors (i.e. trophallaxis, grooming, avoidance) as well as the immune responses of bees were not significantly affected by bioinsecticides. However, the locomotion response and flight orientation of the bees were significantly altered by insecticide when administered by ingestion.

Imidacloprid is a widely used neonicotinoid; thus, we have highlighted the importance of assessing its oral toxicity to Africanized bees and used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the sublethal effects in the brain, the target organ, and the midgut, responsible for the digestion/absorption of food. In addition, the distribution of proteins involved in important biological processes in the brain were evaluated on the 1st day of exposure by MALDI-imaging analysis. Bioassays were performed to determine the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid to bees, and the value obtained was 1.4651 ng imidacloprid/mu L diet. Based on this result, the sublethal concentration to be administered at 1, 4 and 8 days was established as a hundredth (1/100) of the LC50. The results obtained from the ultrastructural analysis showed alterations in the midgut cells of bees as nuclear and mitochondrial damage and an increase of vacuoles. The insecticide caused spacing among the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies, chromatin condensation and loss of mitochondrial cristae. The MALDI-imaging analysis showed an increase in the expression of such proteins as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, amyloid protein precursor and protein kinase C, which are related to oxygen supply, neuronal degeneration and memory/learning, and a decrease in the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 1, which is fundamental to the synapses.

With the advancement of agricultural modernisation, the large-scale use of neonicotinoid insecticides is one of the main factors leading to the decline of bees. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect and the mechanisms underlying bees impaired by dinotefuran. Acute (48 h) oral toxicity tests showed that a 5% lethal concentration (LC5 ) was 0.220 mg/L, and a 20% lethal concentration (LC20 ) was 0.458 mg/L. The gene expression profile shows that when compared with the control group, the LC5 group induced 206 significantly upregulated, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 363 significantly downregulated DEGs, while the LC20 group induced 180 significantly upregulated DEGs and 419 significantly downregulated DEGs. Significantly, transcriptomic analysis revealed DEGs involved in immunity, detoxification, and the nervous system, such as antimicrobial peptides, vitellogenin, synaptotagmin-10, AChE-2, and nAChRa9. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism pathways.

Recent research on honey bee cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) uncovered CYP9Q3 as the molecular determinant mediating neonicotinoid insecticide selectivity and explaining why certain neonicotinoids such as thiacloprid show > 1000-fold lower acute toxicity than others (e.g. imidacloprid). Here this knowledge is leveraged for mechanistic risk assessment at the molecular level using a fluorescence-based high-throughput in vitro assay, predicting the interaction of diverse pesticidal chemotypes, including azole fungicides, with recombinantly expressed honey bee CYP9Q enzymes, known to metabolize thiacloprid, acetamiprid and tau-fluvalinate. Some azole fungicides were shown to be synergistic in combination with certain insecticides, including neonicotinoids and pyrethroids, whereas others such as prothioconazole were not. We demonstrate that biochemical CYP9Q2/CYP9Q3 inhibition data of azoles revealed a striking correlation with their synergistic potential at the organismal level, and even allow to explain combined toxicity effects observed for tank mixtures under field conditions.

262,542,JOUR,Pesticide risk assessment: honeybee workers are not all equal regarding the risk posed by exposure to pesticides,"['Barascou, L', 'Sene, D', 'Le Conte, Y', 'Alaux, C']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Toxicological studies in honeybees have long shown that a single pesticide dose or concentration does not necessarily induce a single response. Inter-individual differences in pesticide sensitivity and/or the level of exposure (e.g., ingestion of pesticide-contaminated matrices) may explain this variability in risk posed by a pesticide. Therefore, to better inform pesticide risk assessment for honeybees, we studied the risk posed by pesticides to two behavioral castes, nurse, and forager bees, which are largely represented within colonies and which exhibit large differences in their physiological backgrounds. For that purpose, we determined the sensitivity of nurses and foragers to azoxystrobin (fungicide) and sulfoxaflor (insecticide) upon acute or chronic exposure. Azoxystrobin was found to be weakly toxic to both types of bees. However, foragers were more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than nurses upon acute and chronic exposure. This phenomenon was not explained by better sulfoxaflor metabolization in nurses, but rather by differences in body weight (nurses being 1.6 times heavier than foragers). Foragers consistently consumed more sugar syrup than nurses, and this increased consumption was even more pronounced with pesticide-contaminated syrup (at specific concentrations). Altogether, the stronger susceptibility and exposure of foragers to sulfoxaflor contributed to increases of 2 and tenfold for the acute and chronic risk quotients, respectively, compared to nurses. In conclusion, to increase the safety margin and avoid an under-estimation of the risk posed by insecticides to honeybees, we recommend systematically including forager bees in regulatory tests.",2022/12//,2022,10.1007/s11356-022-21969-2,29.0,60,90328,90337,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'metabolite', 'worker caste', 'safety', 'Risk quotient', 'Forager', 'Nurse', 'Pesticide metabolization', 'Pesticide sensitivity']",0944-1344,WOS:000828463000005,,,1,96,0,
219,499,JOUR,Impairments in learning and memory performances associated with nicotinic receptor expression in the honeybee Apis mellifera after exposure to a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor,"['Cartereau, A.', 'Pineau, X.', 'Lebreton, J.', 'Math√©-Allainmat, M.', 'Taillebois, E.', 'Thany, S.H.']",PLoS ONE,"Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the AmelŒ≤1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of AmelŒ±9 and AmelŒ≤2, and down-regulation of AmelŒ±1, AmelŒ±3 and AmelŒ±7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affect honeybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain. ¬© 2022 Public Library of Science.

In this work, a pretreatment of honey bees with a sublethal dose of thiacloprid resulted in induced insensitivity to the same compound immediately following thiacloprid feeding. A longer pretreatment time resulted in no, or increased, sensitivity.

Flight muscles are a crucial source of physiological heat as well as being vital for behavioural heat regulation, and are negatively affected by neonicotinoid insecticides. In this study, we evaluated the flight efficiency and capacity of Apis mellifera scutellata under the influence of both elevated ambient temperatures and sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The various aspects of flight; success, distance, speed, and duration, were not notably affected by these factors. However, the honey bees‚Äô ability to initiate a successful flight was significantly affected by neonicotinoid exposure. Such a reduction in honey bee flight capacity, and flight muscle function in general, especially under the increasing frequency and intensity of hot weather events, is cause for concern when considering legislation and use of these neonicotinoids in the agricultural and suburban setting. ¬© 2024 The Author(s).

Previous work has shed new light on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees by uncovering pathways through which neonicotinoids affect bee population dynamics and the potential interactions they have with exogenous stressors. Yet, little is known about whether these effects translate in a field- relevant setting to substantial losses in honey yields for commercial beekeepers. Here, we used data from a 6-year survey of 60 apiaries in Greece and economic modelling to assess at the field level the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on honey production. Based on production function estimates, we found that sub-lethal concentrations of two widely used neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) detected in the nectar of flowers resulted in substantial losses in honey production for commercial beekeepers in our sample. By simulating a scenario with ideal pathogenic and environmental conditions, we found that the magnitude of the neonicotinoid effects decreases significantly under ideal conditions providing evidence for possible synergies at the field between neonicotinoids and environmental and pathogenic factors. Moreover, in a replicated study with grouped apiaries, we found evidence that the marginal effects of neonicotinoids on honey production vary across apiaries facing different conditions.",2019/04/25/,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0215363,14.0,4,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000465519100021,,,0,100,1,
283,563,JOUR,Short-term lab assessments and microcolonies are insufficient for the risk assessment of insecticides for bees,"['Van Oystaeyen, A.', 'Klatt, B.K.', 'Petit, C.', 'Lenaerts, N.', 'W√§ckers, F.']",Chemosphere,"Risk assessment studies addressing effects of agrochemicals on bumblebees frequently use microcolonies. These are queenless colonies consisting of workers only in which typically one worker will lay unfertilized male-destined eggs. In the first tier of risk assessment for bees, short-term laboratory experiments (e.g. microcolonies) are used, the results of which will determine whether higher tier (semi-)field experiments are needed. To evaluate the suitability of microcolonies for risk assessment, a direct comparison between different assessment methods for the neonicotinoid pesticides acetamiprid and thiacloprid was made: microcolonies and queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions, queenright colonies under long-term laboratory conditions, and queenright colonies under field conditions. Here, we demonstrate that results from microcolonies contradict results from queenright colonies. While thiacloprid negatively impacted gyne production in queenright colonies, it had a positive effect on microcolony size. By contrast, thiacloprid had no significant effect on fitness parameters of queenright colonies under short-term laboratory conditions when mostly workers are produced. These results thus highlight both the need for long term assessments, allowing evaluation of gyne production, and the risk of reaching erroneous conclusions when using microcolonies. The negative effect of thiacloprid on colony fitness was confirmed under field conditions, where thiacloprid affected the production of reproductives, colony weight gain, worker weight, and foraging behaviour. For acetamiprid, a negative trend on colony fitness could only be shown in a field setup. Therefore, field-realistic setups, which allow colonies to forage freely, are most appropriate to assess sublethal effects of pesticides affecting behaviour and learning. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128518,273.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092790597&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.128518&partnerID=40&md5=fb8a28fcd64a9319bbbfbef71f5b2696,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'Pesticide effects', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'body weight gain', 'comparative study', 'organism colony', 'reproduction', 'worker (insect)', 'laboratory', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Health', 'thiacloprid', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Bumblebees', 'evaluation study', 'Field conditions', 'Field experiment', 'fitness', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory conditions', 'Laboratory experiments', 'Male', 'Microcolonies', 'Microcolony', 'Reproduction', 'Risk Assessment']",,,,,0,101,1,

Poorly known is the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple pesticides, which has high likelihood in agricultural landscapes. Four experiments were conducted to determine if simultaneous exposure to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide Assail¬Æ(30% acetamiprid) and the fungicide Orbit¬Æor Tilt¬Æ(41.8% propiconazole) would cause detrimental effects on survival and colony productivity of the common eastern bumble bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae). Survival of workers exposed to propiconazole was marginally reduced (Experiment 1), whereas gyne production increased in colonies exposed to acetamiprid (Experiment 2). There was a trend for fewer larvae and workers in colonies exposed to acetamiprid and a mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 3). Higher wax moth infestations and densities were observed in colonies exposed to the mixture of acetamiprid and propiconazole (Experiment 4). In conclusion, exposure to the two pesticides resulted in variable outcomes in B. impatiens. Synergy between acetamiprid and propiconazole was explained as an indirect effect of enhanced wax worm infestation. We found an increased level of wax worm infestation in colonies exposed to a mixture of Assail and Tilt compared to colonies not exposed to Assail or Tilt (control) or exposed only to Assail. While this study does not provide evidence that B. impatiens are at high risk when simultaneously exposed to field rates of these two pesticides, we suggest that wild blueberry growers practice integrated pest management as a means of reducing any amount of risk to these important bumble bees. ¬© 2020 South Carolina Entomological Society.

The active ingredient imidacloprid has action on the nervous system of the insects. However, little has been studied about the actions of the insecticide on nontarget organs of insects, such as the Malpighian tubules that make up the excretory and osmoregulatory system. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid in Malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera. In the tubules of treated bees, we found an increase in the number of cells with picnotic nuclei, the lost of part of the cell into the lumen, and a homogenization of coloring cytoplasm. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolization. We confirmed the increased occurrence of picnotic nuclei by using the Feulgan reaction, which showed the chromatin compaction was more intense in the tubules of bees exposed to the insecticide. We observed an intensification of the staining of the nucleus with Xylidine Ponceau, further verifying the cytoplasmic negative regions that may indicate autophagic activity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry experiments showed TUNEL positive nuclei in exposed bees, implicating increased cell apoptosis after chronic imidacloprid exposure. In conclusion, our results indicate that very low concentrations of imidacloprid lead to cytotoxic activity in the Malpighian tubules of exposed bees at all tested times for exposure and imply that this insecticide can alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013///,2013,10.1002/jemt.22199,76.0,5,552,558,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875932526&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22199&partnerID=40&md5=095fa40511ee3488e63a065d4d6c8361,Scopus,,,,,,0,103,1,

The molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we measured the response of juvenile hormone (JH) to environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), monitored the dynamic changes in the transcription of genes encoding major JH metabolic enzymes (CYP15A1, FAMET, JHAMT and JHE) using RT-qPCR, and analysed the transcriptome changes in worker larvae under thiamethoxam stress using RNA-seq. Thiamethoxam significantly increased the levels of JH3 in honey bee larvae, but no significant changes in the transcript levels of the four major metabolic enzymes were observed. Thiamethoxam exposure resulted in 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). P450 CYP6AS5 was upregulated, and some ion-related, odourant-related and gustatory receptors for sugar taste genes were altered significantly. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption were influenced by thiamethoxam. These changes may do harm to honey bee caste differentiation, foraging behaviour related to sensory perception and nutrient levels of bee colonies. These results represent the first assessment of the effects of thiamethoxam on JH in honey bee larvae and provides a new perspective and molecular basis for the study of JH regulation and thiamethoxam toxicity to honey bees. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112744,225.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113981771&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112744&partnerID=40&md5=3fb6dccdc415c1491982f28525a64083,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'Larva', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'liquid chromatography', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'thiamethoxam', 'worker (insect)', 'Honey bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'sublethal concentration', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'genetics', 'transcriptome', 'insect larva', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'RNA', 'RNA-seq', 'RT-qPCR', 'Juvenile hormone', 'genetic transcription', 'amino acid metabolism', 'hormone', 'juvenile', 'juvenile hormone', 'Juvenile Hormones', 'RNA sequence', 'sensation']",,,,,0,104,1,

However, pesticide application is still recognized as one of the main stress factors causing a decline in the global population of bees. In all ERA procedures, the effects of pesticides on the honey bee species Apis mellifera are used as a reference for the effects on all different bee species. To evaluate if tropical native bees are protected by the current risk assessment procedures and to propose improvements to the methods, we assessed the ecological risk of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid posed to native and exotic bee species. The risk was assessed through a low (TIER I) and an intermediate (TIER II) level of analysis. For TIER I the USEPA BeeREX model was used and for TIER II the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach was adopted. For the imidacloprid exposure conditions, four different crops were taken into consideration; bean, passion fruit, sunflower and tomato. The imidacloprid risk on native species was assessed both by extrapolating the effects obtained to Apis species, and by using ecotoxicological data from tests performed with native species. In TIER I, the risks calculated through empirical data showed that more than 50% of the non-Apis species presented risk levels of 28‚Äì180% higher than those obtained with the extrapolation factor used in the Brazilian pesticide regulation. In TIER II, the SSDs showed that most of the native bees are more sensitive to imidacloprid than the Africanized A. mellifera.

The organs of both control bees and bees exposed to insecticide were subjected to morphological, histochemical and immunocytochemical analysis after exposure to imidacloprid, respectively, for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. In mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 and in optic lobes of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD 50/10, LD50/100, and LD50/50, we observed the presence of condensed cells. The Feulgen reaction revealed the presence of some cells with pyknotic nuclei, whereas Xylidine Ponceau stain revealed strongly stained cells. These characteristics can indicate the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, cells in mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 appeared to be swollen. Cell death was confirmed by immunocytochemical technique.

Defining them is thus one of the main challenges of a risk assessment scheme design. In the light of the scientific publications on the subject, the existing risk coefficients and methodologies used for the toxicity evaluation under international guidelines result questionable. Results: LD50 values have shown to be variable. Prolonged effects following single contact can sometimes be observed when measuring the acute toxicity. The trigger value (10) of the risk coefficient results as inadequate. The toxicity derived from the exposure to substances continuously available for bees at sub-lethal doses needs to be evaluated separately, given the wide differences between acute and chronic lethal effects of pesticides. Conclusions: The observation period of the mortality tests should be lengthened as long as mortality increases, and while control mortality remains acceptable. Whenever active substances can pollute bees' food sources, first tier tests should include laboratory tests: (1) on adult bees with: (a) acute toxicity tests; (b) chronic toxicity tests; (c) behavioural tests; and (2) larvae toxicity tests.

This concern arises from their crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and global food production. Therefore, an extensive investigation has been conducted to explore the intricate relationship between pesticides and the biological development of honey bees in the Rahim Yar Khan region. This study assessed the impact of four pesticides (Emamectin benzoate, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid) on honey bee eggs, larvae, and adult bees under controlled laboratory conditions. The pesticides were applied at concentrations of 10%, 30%, and 50%, as per regional agricultural recommendations. A zero-toxicity control was also included for comparison. Toxicity evaluations were conducted through contact exposure, and Probit and regression analyses were performed using SPSS software to comprehensively assess the toxicity profiles. The study revealed significant adverse effects on the immediate behavioral responses of A. mellifera following pesticide exposure. These effects included heightened agitation, narcotic-like symptoms, audible hovering, crawling, ceased food-sharing behavior, and reduced proboscis extension. Chlorpyrifos exhibited the highest toxicity against adult bees, while Emamectin Benzoate had the least toxicity. Regarding honey bee eggs, Chlorpyrifos, Imidacloprid, and Acetamiprid were notably more toxic, whereas Emamectin Benzoate exhibited the least toxicity. The impact on larvae varied across developmental stages and pesticides, with Imidacloprid, Chlorpyrifos, and Acetamiprid causing significant mortality, while Emamectin Benzoate showed lower toxicity. The study highlights that Emamectin Benzoate demonstrates lower toxicity compared to other insecticides. This emphasizes the importance of balancing effective pest management with the preservation of pollinator health. The findings underscore the need for informed and sustainable approaches to pesticide use, taking into consideration the potential repercussions on honeybee development and behavior. ¬© Iqbal, et al.",2024///,2024,10.3897/ejfa.2024.122884,2024.0,36,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85196789830&doi=10.3897%2fejfa.2024.122884&partnerID=40&md5=c74b64ea0385de562bae3fba000785b3,Scopus,"['Insecticides', 'apiculture', 'pesticide exposure', 'biological development', 'honeybee health']",,,,,0,109,0,

Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate ‚Äì Roundup¬Æ], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity. Taken altogether, the results highlight the importance of testing the impact of multiple agrochemicals (i.e. not just insecticides) through different routes of exposure in order to understand more comprehensively the potential risks for Apis and non-Apis bees. ¬© 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s10646-023-02699-8,32.0,7,937,947,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85171634065&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-023-02699-8&partnerID=40&md5=dbef87e190ded8596131a3f6c4a8ecfa,Scopus,"['ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'flight', 'thiamethoxam', 'Ecotoxicology', 'ingestion', 'stingless bee', 'mortality', 'toxicity testing', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'pollution effect', 'agrochemical', 'agricultural chemical', 'fungicide', 'bioassay', 'Fungicides', 'ecotoxicity', 'escape behavior', 'Native bees', 'Endangered bees', 'endangered species', 'environmental impact assessment', 'mancozeb', 'native species']",,,,,0,110,0,

Thus, the objective of the current work was to evaluate, in a laboratory bioassay, the residual toxicity and effect of imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and a mixture of both, when applied on canola in the field, on Africanized A. mellifera workers. Three commercial products were applied, formulated with imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid. Each plot received one of the three treatments, in the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at intervals between 14 and 0¬†days prior to conducting the bioassays. On the day of the bioassay, the bees were exposed to the plant material containing the treatments for a period of two hours, and were transferred to PVC cages, containing food and water. Mortality assessments were then performed at pre-established intervals until a 96¬†h post-exposure. Residuals on canola leaves of all tested products caused a significant reduction of honeybee worker longevity, which was less accentuated when the interval after treatment application increased.

After oral application, acetamiprid and deltamethrin at the concentrations used were not able to impair learning sessions. When the retention tests were performed 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h after learning, we found a significant difference between bees after learning sessions when drugs were applied 24 h before learning. Deltamethrin-treated bees were found to be more sensitive at 10 ng/bee and 100 ng/bee doses compared to acetamiprid-treated bees, only with amounts of 100 ng/bee and at 6 h and 24 h delays. When insecticides were applied during learning sessions, none of the tested insecticides was able to impair learning performance at 10 ng/bee or 100 ng/bee but retention performance was altered 24 h after learning sessions. Acetamiprid was the only one to impair retrieval at 10 ng/bee, whereas at 100 ng/bee an impairment of retrieval was found with both insecticides.

236,516,JOUR,Spinosad toxicity to pollinators and associated risk,"['Mayes, M.A.', 'Thompson, G.D.', 'Husband, B.', 'Miles, M.M.']",Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Spinosad is a natural insecticide derived from an actinomycete bacterium species, Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao 1990), that displays the efficacy of a synthetic insecticide. It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2003.",2003///,2003,10.1007/0-387-21731-2_2,179.0,,37,71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242371130&doi=10.1007%2f0-387-21731-2_2&partnerID=40&md5=db500ad2fa15244e47bc391f46f4601a,Scopus,,,,,,0,113,0,

As such it is intrinsically toxic to insects and among them to the honey bee (Apis mellifera). An updated risk assessment is presented in the context of the regulatory evaluation of spinosad products and is in accordance with the latest recommendation of regulatory guidance documents. Results: The intrinsic toxicity to the honey bee as observed in laboratory conditions through oral and contact tests on adults does not appear to impair honey bee colonies when exposed to treated attractive crops in tunnel conditions. Reasons for this could include reduced availability of residues of the product on plant surface compared to laboratory conditions, together with a fast dissipation from treated plants and the absence of active degradation products. Conclusions: Spinosad products present a negligible impact on honey bees when used under the current label recommendations and conditions of agricultural use. This conclusion deduced from data available for the regulatory risk assessment has been confirmed by the feedback of surveys on incidents, which address the potential impact of spinosad products under realistic conditions of exposure, including other environmental and chemical factors that are common in cropped areas.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.032,437.0,,107,114,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200026,,,0,114,0,

Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS: Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L‚àí1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L‚àí1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L‚àí1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L‚àí1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control. A significant decrease in survival, relative to the solvent control, occurred in the 0.8, 1.2 and 8 mg L‚àí1 chlorpyrifos, 0.4, 2 and 10 mg L‚àí1 clothianidin, and 45 mg L‚àí1 dimethoate diets, but not the imidacloprid diets. CONCLUSION: The treatment of larval diets with clothianidin, dimethoate and imidacloprid did not affect survival, developmental rate, or weight of immature honey bees; however, treatment with chlorpyrifos did.

The ubiquity of bee pollinators in agricultural landscapes frequently results in their exposure to agrochemicals, which has been associated with their decline. Stingless bees are wild pollinators restricted to the Pantropical region, and like honey bees, are suffering colony losses. However, stingless bees and honey bees do not show the same behaviors, therefore, methods used for risk assessment of honey bees cannot be utilized on stingless bees. Herein, we describe protocols to standardize methods that allow for the exploration of lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals via acute and chronic exposure of stingless bees. The in vitro rearing used for chronic exposure from the egg to the adult stage proved to be effective in obtaining relevant screenings. In addition, we performed a meta‚Äêanalysis and summarized the results of toxicological studies conducted with the protocols described. The meta-analyses indicated a reduction in survival under acute and chronic exposures to agrochemicals, and revealed that our protocols for toxicological assessments did not have publication bias for either acute or chronic exposure.

55,335,JOUR,Pesticide residues and bees - A risk assessment,"['Sanchez-Bayo, F.', 'Goka, K.']",PLoS ONE,"Bees are essential pollinators of many plants in natural ecosystems and agricultural crops alike. In recent years the decline and disappearance of bee species in the wild and the collapse of honey bee colonies have concerned ecologists and apiculturalists, who search for causes and solutions to this problem. Whilst biological factors such as viral diseases, mite and parasite infections are undoubtedly involved, it is also evident that pesticides applied to agricultural crops have a negative impact on bees. Most risk assessments have focused on direct acute exposure of bees to agrochemicals from spray drift. However, the large number of pesticide residues found in pollen and honey demand a thorough evaluation of all residual compounds so as to identify those of highest risk to bees. Using data from recent residue surveys and toxicity of pesticides to honey and bumble bees, a comprehensive evaluation of risks under current exposure conditions is presented here. Standard risk assessments are complemented with new approaches that take into account time-cumulative effects over time, especially with dietary exposures. Whilst overall risks appear to be low, our analysis indicates that residues of pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides pose the highest risk by contact exposure of bees with contaminated pollen. However, the synergism of ergosterol inhibiting fungicides with those two classes of insecticides results in much higher risks in spite of the low prevalence of their combined residues. Risks by ingestion of contaminated pollen and honey are of some concern for systemic insecticides, particularly imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, chlorpyrifos and the mixtures of cyhalothrin and ergosterol inhibiting fungicides. More attention should be paid to specific residue mixtures that may result in synergistic toxicity to bees. ¬© 2014 Sanchez-Bayo, Goka.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0094482,9.0,4,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899582629&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0094482&partnerID=40&md5=4970f1b8f70b3cb3c7a0aceae4aeef18,Scopus,,,,,,0,118,0,

The mechanism behind the negative impacts of neonicotinoids on honeybees has attracted considerable interest, yet it remains unknown due to the limited insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticides in honeybees. Herein, we demonstrated the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDIMSI) for the spatiotemporal visualization of neonicotinoids, such as N-nitroguanidine (dinotefuran) and Ncyanoamidine (acetamiprid) compounds, administered by oral application or direct contact, in the whole-body section of honeybees. The MSI results revealed that both dinotefuran and acetamiprid can quickly penetrate various biological barriers and distribute within the whole-body section of honeybees, but acetamiprid can be degraded much faster than dinotefuran. The degradation rate of acetamiprid is significantly decreased when piperonyl butoxide (PBO) is applied, whereas that of dinotefuran remains almost unchanged. These two factors might contribute to the fact that dinotefuran affords a higher toxicity to honeybees than acetamiprid. Moreover, the toxicity and degradation rate of acetamiprid can be affected by co-application with tebuconazole. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that the discrepant toxicity between dinotefuran and acetamiprid does not lie in the difference in their of various barriers of but in the degradation rate of neonicotinoid pesticides within honeybee tissues. Moreover, new perspectives are given to better understand the causes of the current decline in honeybee populations posed by insecticides, providing guidelines for the precise use of conventional agrochemicals and the rational design of novel pesticide candidates.

However, these effects can bring important information to understanding the impacts of pesticides on bees' daily activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) on the behavior of the Neotropical solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male bees were exposed to these chemicals continuously for 48 h, followed by an additional 48 h without contaminated food, totaling 96 h of observation. We used five experimental groups: control, solvent control, insecticide, fungicide, and pesticide mixture (insecticide + fungicide). Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli. Bees exposed to acetamiprid and pesticide mixture showed lethargic movements and impaired locomotion at 48 h. Notably, these behavioral effects were no longer evident after the bees consumed uncontaminated food for an additional 48 h, totaling 96 h from the start of pesticide exposure. Only fungicide exposure did not result in any behavioral or brain histological changes. Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees. These findings highlight the importance of considering sublethal effects in environmental risk assessment. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.143254,364.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203020312&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.143254&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0579ad3d1ff4544f162d578e82d2d,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'animal behavior', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'toxicity', 'Sublethal effects', 'Pesticide effects', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Neotropics', 'locomotion', 'male', 'mushroom body', 'Male', 'Mushroom bodies', 'unclassified drug', 'behavior', 'fungicide', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Locomotion', 'brain', 'organic farming', 'Female', 'behavioral response', 'Exposed to', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Pesticide mixture', 'Behavior', 'histopathology', 'Pyrimidines', 'environmental risk', 'Brain', 'phototaxis', 'mushroom', 'Pesticides exposures', 'nerve cell', 'movement (physiology)', 'Neotropical Region', 'Azoxystrobin', 'kenyon cell', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'perception', 'central nervous system', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid', 'behavioral science', 'bootstrapping', 'Centris analis', 'Macroinvertebrates', 'Neotropical bee', 'regulatory mechanism', 'Video-tracking']",,,,,0,121,0,

338,618,JOUR,Are honeybees suitable surrogates for use in pesticide risk assessment for non-Apis bees?,"['Thompson, HM', 'Pamminger, T']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"Historically, bee regulatory risk assessment for pesticides has centred on the European honeybee (Apis mellifera), primarily due to its availability and adaptability to laboratory conditions. Recently, there have been efforts to develop a battery of laboratory toxicity tests for a range of non-Apis bee species to directly assess the risk to them. However, it is not clear whether the substantial investment associated with the development and implementation of such routine screening will actually improve the level of protection of non-Apis bees. We argue, using published acute toxicity data from a range of bee species and standard regulatory exposure scenarios, that current first-tier honeybee acute risk assessment schemes utilised by regulatory authorities are protective of other bee species and further tests should be conducted only in cases of concern. We propose similar analysis of alternative exposure scenarios (chronic and developmental) once reliable data for non-Apis bees are available to expand our approach to these scenarios. In addition, we propose that in silico (simulation) approaches can then be used to address population-level effects in more field-realistic scenarios. Such an approach could lead to a protective, but also workable, risk assessment for non-Apis species while contributing to pollination security in agricultural landscapes around the globe.

Thiamethoxam and spinosad are widely used as pesticides in agriculture but they have become an important concern for beekeepers and researchers focusing on bee health; multiple reports stressed adverse effects on bees, notably on honey bees. The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two insecticides on the development of the HPGs and on the survival of Apis mellifera intermissa a native African subspecies of honey bee present in Algeria. Newly emerged workers were acutely and chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and spinosad through sugar syrup and pollen pastry. The effects of these insecticides were assessed by measuring the size of HPGs acini and the total head protein content. The survival of the workers was also evaluated over 60 days when they were chronically exposed to the insecticides at concentrations corresponding to LC25 and LC10. We found that the insecticide-treated workers, after both acute and chronic exposure, exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped HPG acini. The total head protein content also decreased in treated individuals with the two concentrations of insecticides at day 6 and 9 compared to the respective controls. While the control group exhibited an LC25 (i.e. the time needed to kill 50% of the tested workers) of 22 days, the LC25 was only 3 days for the workers exposed to the LC25 of spinosad and all workers were dead at day 17. In contrast, thiamethoxam exposure at LC25 had no significant detrimental effect on honey bee survival.

With regard to the widespread use of pesticides in agricultural lands, honey bees, as non-target and useful insect, inadvertently contact these chemicals. Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of some pesticides, the toxicity of three insecticides from different chemical classes including imidacloprid (0.16¬†mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47¬†mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500¬†mg a.i./l) on detoxifying enzymes of worker honey bees and mortality of immature bees was investigated. These chemicals were selected because they are used globally and ingested by honey bees. The sub-lethal concentration of imidacloprid reduced the activity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Exposure to the sub-lethal concentrations of the ethion reduced the esterase (EST) activities in treated honey bees. Exposure of honey bee larvae to imidacloprid (0.16¬†mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47¬†mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500¬†mg a.i./l) increased the mortality of the treated group compared to untreated controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. Our results indicate that imidacloprid and ethion disrupt the physiology of honey bees, thereby reducing the efficiency of this beneficial pollinator.

For this purpose two different rates of abraded seed dust, containing active substance Clothianidin, were applied on flowering Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham during bee-flight with a purpose-built dust applicator. We observed dose-related high acute effects on bee mortality at both application rates, 0.25 and 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin in dust per ha, resulting in up to 4.3 and 17 fold higher mortality compared to pre-application level and an overall increase of mortality during the 7 days exposure period of 2.0 and 9.8 fold. In dead bees, residues detected between both rates appliedwere up to 2.6 fold higher in the 1.0 g a.s. Clothianidin dust exposure scenario. On day 7, residues up to 28 Œºg Clothianidin/kg were detected in bee bread of stored Phacelia pollen. The findings of high effects at chosen rates highlight the need to include specific dust drift field trials for seed treatment products with highly toxic insecticides in risk assessment used in crops with potential dust abrasion and emission from seeds.

The pollination carried out by the honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is crucial in increasing the productivity of the melon (Cucumis melo L.). The main objective of this study was to assess if insecticides applied in the cultivation of cantaloupe melon exhibit significant levels of toxicity toward A. mellifera. We tested the toxicity of azadirachtin, pyriproxyfen, chlorantraniliprole, and imidacloprid, which are commonly sprayed to manage melon pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.)

Three treatments were carried out, 0.0x, 0.1x and 1.0x the concentration recommended by the manufacturer for the control of those pests. Repellency tests, analysis of mortality through contact and ingestion, and flight tests were performed. The insecticide imidacloprid caused mortality rates above 90% in all tested exposure pathways, displaying high residue persistence on plants. Although not causing significant mortality in the ingestion test, pyriproxyfen caused significant mortality after exposure through contact, and change in flight ability. Azadirachtin caused mortality in the ingestion test and impaired the flight ability of bees, while chlorantraniliprole only impaired the flight ability. Moreover, bees were not repelled by these insecticides, suggesting that they may collect contaminated food in the field while foraging.

In contrast to single applications of plant protection products (PPP), the effects of tank mixtures of two or more PPP on honey bees are not routinely assessed in the risk assessment of plant protection products. However, tank mixes are often common practice by farmers. Mixtures of practically non-toxic substances can lead to synergistic increase of toxic effects on honey bees, observed for the first time in 19921 in combinations of pyrethroids and azole fungicides. 2004 Iwasa et al. already reported that ergosterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides strongly increase the toxicity of neonicotinoids in laboratory for the contact exposure route. Furthermore, in agricultural practice additives, adjuvants and fertilizers may be added to the spray solution. For these additives usually no informations on potential side effects on bees are available when mixed with plant protection products. Therefore, it is considered necessary to investigate possible additive or synergistic impacts and evaluate potentially critical combinations to ensure protection of bees.

However, flupyradifurone was shown in acute toxicity tests to be several orders of magnitude less toxic to western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) than many other insecticides targeting insect nAChRs. The underlying reasons for this difference in toxicity remains unknown and were investigated here. Pharmacokinetic studies after contact application of [14C]flupyradifurone to honey bees revealed slow uptake, with internalized compound degraded into a few metabolites that are all practically non-toxic to honey bees in both oral and contact bioassays. Furthermore, receptor binding studies revealed a lack of high-affinity binding of these metabolites to honey bee nAChRs. Screening of a library of 27 heterologously expressed honey bee cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) identified three P450s involved in the detoxification of flupyradifurone: CYP6AQ1, CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3. Transgenic Drosophila lines ectopically expressing CYP9Q2 and CYP9Q3 were significantly less susceptible to flupyradifurone when compared to control flies, confirming the importance of these P450s for flupyradifurone metabolism in honey bees. Biochemical assays using the fluorescent probe substrate 7-benzyloxymethoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BOMFC) indicated a weak, non-competitive inhibition of BOMFC metabolism by flupyradifurone. In contrast, the azole fungicides prochloraz and propiconazole were strong nanomolar inhibitors of these flupyradifurone metabolizing P450s, explaining their highly synergistic effects in combination with flupyradifurone as demonstrated in acute laboratory contact toxicity tests of adult bees. Interestingly, the azole fungicide prothioconazole is only slightly synergistic in combination with flupyradifurone ‚Äì an observation supported by molecular P450 inhibition assays. Such molecular assays have value in the prediction of potential risks posed to bees by flupyradifurone mixture partners under applied conditions. Quantitative PCR confirmed the expression of the identified P450 genes in all honey bee life-stages, with highest expression levels observed in late larvae and adults, suggesting honey bees have the capacity to metabolize flupyradifurone across all life-stages. These findings provide a biochemical explanation for the low intrinsic toxicity of flupyradifurone to honey bees and offer a new, more holistic approach to support bee pollinator risk assessment by molecular means. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112247,217.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85104682585&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112247&partnerID=40&md5=f354e85b43a93450221db965c545b476,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pest control', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'adult', 'toxicity testing', 'Drosophila', 'gene expression', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'Pollinators', 'animal tissue', 'in vitro study', 'metabolism', 'fungicide', 'bioassay', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'metabolite', '4-Butyrolactone', 'flupyradifurone', 'gamma butyrolactone', 'butenolide', 'synergism', 'propiconazole', 'triazole derivative', 'Triazoles', 'Synergism', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'binding affinity', 'safety', 'toxicity test', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'biochemical analysis', 'scanning electron microscopy', 'gene expression regulation', 'aerobic metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome', 'tissue distribution', 'carbon 14', 'gene identification', 'validation study', 'toxicogenomics', 'enzyme structure', 'contact bioassay', 'oral bioassay', 'P450', 'cytochrome P6AQ1', 'cytochrome P9Q2', 'cytochrome P9Q3', 'enzyme kinetics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'receptor binding', 'toxicogenetics', 'Toxicogenetics']",,,,,0,130,0,

We fed stingless bees with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 ng of imidacloprid, tested their innate appetitive responsiveness and trained them to associate odors and sucrose reward using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. The same experiments were performed on Africanized honey bees. One hour after intoxication, both species decreased their innate responsiveness to sucrose but the effect was more accentuated in stingless bees.

We expand these assessments to include 12 species of native and non-native crop pollinators of differing levels of body size, sociality, and floral specialization. Bees were collected throughout 2016 and 2017 from flowering blueberry, squash, pumpkin, sunflower and okra in south Mississippi, USA. Within 30-60 minutes of capture, bees were installed in bioassay cages made from transparent plastic cups and dark amber jars. Bees were fed via dental wicks saturated with 27% (1.25 M) sugar syrup containing a realistic range of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 5, 20, or 100 ppb) that are often found in nectar. Bees displayed no visible tremors or convulsions except for a small sweat bee, Halictus ligatus, and only at 100ppb syrup. Imidacloprid shortened the captive longevities of the solitary bees. Tolerant bee species lived ‚àº10 to 12 days in the bioassays and included two social and one solitary species: Halictus ligatus, Apis mellifera and Ptilothrix bombiformis (rose mallow bees), respectively. No other bee species tolerated imidacloprid as well as honey bees did, which exhibited no appreciable mortality and only modest paralysis across concentration. In contrast, native bees either lived shorter lives, experienced longer paralysis, or endured both. Overall, longevity decreased with concentration linearly for social bees and non-linearly for solitary species.

Honey bees as well as other pollinators are nectar and pollen foragers and thus are exposed to an extensive range of phytochemicals. Understanding the synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects of plant secondary metabolites and pesticides in honey bees may help to protect honey bee colonies against agrochemicals. In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics to investigate the impact of dietary phytochemical composition on the residual concentration of three pesticides: imidacloprid, tau-fluvalinate and tebuconazole in exposed honey bees. Honey bees were given different diets based on pollen or nectar from four plants: Reseda odorata, Borago officinalis, Phacelia tanacetifolia, and Trifolium repens for two days. Thereafter, they were orally exposed to 10 ng/bee imidacloprid or contact-exposed to 0.9 Œºg/bee tau-fluvalinate or 5 Œºg/bee tebuconazole. After 1 h of oral exposure or 24 h of contact exposure, the honey bees were anaesthetised with CO2, sacrificed by freezing, extracted with a validated QuEChERS method, and residual pesticide concentrations were determined by LC-QTRAP-MS/MS. The phytochemical composition in the given diets were profiled with an UHPLC-Q Exactive-MS/MS. The results revealed that the dietary phytochemical composition has a noteworthy influence on the concentration of residual pesticides in honey bees. The correlation coefficient analysis demonstrated that flavonoids have a reducing effect on the residual concentration of imidacloprid and tau-fluvalinate in honey bees. The results also highlighted that exposure to imidacloprid impaired the metabolism of sugars in honey bees. Exploiting flavonoid-rich plants may protect honey bees against pesticides and hold promise as forage plants in future beekeeping. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envint.2021.106503,152.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102853287&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2021.106503&partnerID=40&md5=e56f5dd2fe4a8fbe5579e481fbebd569,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'Pesticide', 'concentration (composition)', 'Food products', 'Imidacloprids', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'nectar', 'Neonicotinoid', 'priority journal', 'Honey bee', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Imidacloprid', 'environmental impact', 'Exposed to', 'plant', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'phytochemical', 'apiculture', 'carbon dioxide', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography', 'metabolomics', 'Metabolomics', 'Trifolium repens', 'fluvalinate', 'tebuconazole', 'Beekeeping', 'Phacelia tanacetifolia', 'Pesticide concentrations', 'freezing', 'forage crop', 'Flavonoid', 'chemical composition', 'phytochemistry', 'Borago', 'Borago officinalis', 'Phytochemical', 'Phytochemical composition', 'Phytochemicals', 'Reseda odorata', 'Residual concentrations', 'white clover']",,,,,0,133,0,

In the current study, we evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53, 13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) of spinosad (formulation), and the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied. The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) reduced the survival of workers during development. Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium. Finally, the chronic exposure of larvae to 32.64 ng. a.i. bee(-1) spinosad also altered the remodeling of the midgut during metamorphosis and affected the organization of the PM of larvae, pupae, and adults.

In this study, we assessed the potential exposure of pollinators to various systemic insecticides and a fungicide used in apple orchards. Residue levels were determined for the whole flower as well as pollen and nectar separately for pre-bloom applications of acetamiprid, imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, and myclobutanil. Very low pesticide residue levels (2‚Äì70 parts per billion, ppb) were found in the whole flower, pollen and nectar samples compared with pesticide concentrations of 60‚Äì200 parts per million (ppm) in applied foliarly only 5 days earlier. Insecticide residues from nectar and pollen samples were below the USA EPA classification of No Observable Effect Limit (NOEL) for acute toxicity to honey bees, suggesting that a single foraging visit to flowers may not cause toxicity to bees. However, cumulative acute exposure from multiple flower visits could potentially be harmful to bees, and needs to be studied further. We also examined apple flowers for residues of several systemic insecticides that were applied for brown marmorated stink bug control late in the fall of the previous season. None of the fall sprays that contained premixed insecticide active ingredients (viz., thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin), including multiple applications of individual active ingredients (viz., dinotefuran, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor), persisted until the following spring. Based on these findings, fall applications of insecticides used for controlling invasive pests such as the brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys) and the spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) could be considered safe to pollinator species foraging in apple orchards during the spring bloom the following season. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2020.114589,265.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085940525&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2020.114589&partnerID=40&md5=763e81d97d1651bb53b9570984feec99,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'apple', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'cyhalothrin', 'exposure', 'Fruits', 'Lambda-cyhalothrin', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'pollution exposure', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (parameter)', 'honeybee', 'flower', 'foraging', 'sulfoxaflor', 'concentration (composition)', 'pesticide residue', 'Pesticide residue', 'thiamethoxam', 'acute toxicity', 'nectar', 'Honey bees', 'Toxicity', 'thiacloprid', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'unclassified drug', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystems', 'Pollinator', 'Agricultural robots', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Ecosystem services', 'season', 'Seasons', 'United States', 'ecosystem function', 'Malus', 'Malus x domestica', 'dinotefuran', 'Potential exposure', 'spring', 'Fungicide', 'Active ingredients', 'orchard', 'Blooms (metal)', 'myclobutanil', 'insect', 'Pesticide concentrations', 'apple orchard', 'beta cyfluthrin', 'falling', 'government regulation', 'Halyomorpha halys', 'Lycorma delicatula', 'Multiple applications', 'No Observable Effect Limit', 'Orchard bees', 'Orchards', 'Parts per millions', 'Toxicity exposure']",,,,,0,136,0,

Because of the haplo-diploid sex determination system in hymenopterans, experiments using micro-colonies (small sub colonies without a queen) to identify risks to bumblebee health are limited as they are only able to produce males. Therefore, an experimental protocol for rearing bumblebee larvae in vitro is needed to better understand effects on worker larvae. Here, we aimed to establish a rearing method for larvae of Bombus terrestris for use in risk assessment assays. To confirm the validity of our rearing method, we tested two insecticides used for tomato cultivation, chlorfenapyr and dinotefuran. Bombus terrestris larvae fed with a high nutrient quantity and quality diet increased growth per day. All chlorfenapyr-exposed individuals died within 10¬†days at 2000-fold dilution, an application dose used for tomatoes. There were significant differences in adult emergence rate among almost all chlorfenapyr treatments. On the other hand, sublethal dinotefuran-exposure did not affect rates of pupation and adult emergence, growth, or larval and pupal periods. Although larvae were smaller than in the natural colony, this rearing method for B. terrestris larvae proved to be effective at evaluating realistic sub-colonies to pesticide exposures. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-19965-0,12.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138350597&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-19965-0&partnerID=40&md5=587842141e7d2a3bc8364f604f12f8d8,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'human', 'Humans', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'larva', 'Larva', 'toxicity testing', 'male', 'Male', 'Toxicity Tests', 'dinotefuran', 'chlorfenapyr']",,,,,0,137,0,

Compared with the well-studied roles of these pesticides in nontarget site (including midgut, ovary, or salivary glands), little has been reported in the target sites, the brain. In the current study, laboratory-reared adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL technique for DNA labeling. We observed significantly increased apoptotic markers in dose- and time-dependent manners in brains of bees exposed to imidacloprid. Neuronal activated caspase-3 and mRNA levels of caspase-1, as detected by immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively, were significantly increased, suggesting that sublethal doses of imidacloprid may induce the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the overlap of apoptosis and autophagy in neurons was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It further suggests that a relationship exists between neurotoxicity and behavioral changes induced by sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that there is a need to determine reasonable limits for imidacloprid application in the field to protect pollinators. ¬© The Authors 2015.

Much of the previous research on the effects of neonicotinoids, a class of insecticide that has gained attention for non-target effects, on bees focused on the consumption of contaminated food resources by a limited number of eusocial species. However, neonicotinoids are known to accumulate and persist in soils at concentrations 2 to 60 times greater than in food resources, and may represent an important route of exposure for diverse and ecologically important ground-nesting bees. This study aimed to assess the effect of chronic contact exposure to realistic soil concentrations of imidacloprid, the most widely used neonicotinoid pesticide, on bee longevity, development speed, and body mass. Cohorts of Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata were used as proxies for ground-nesting species. We observed species- and sex-specific changes to adult longevity, development speed, and mass in response to increasing concentrations of imidacloprid. These results suggest that chronic exposure to nesting substrates contaminated with neonicotinoids may represent an important route of exposure that could have considerable physiological and ecological consequences for bees and plant-pollinator interactions. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",2019///,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-40031-9,9.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062619502&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-40031-9&partnerID=40&md5=4926db55667866309dcb8f393bb19712,Scopus,,,,,,0,139,0,

This study investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to three commercial formulations of agrochemicals [CuSO4 (leaf fertilizer), glyphosate (herbicide), and spinosad (bioinsecticide)] on antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde content (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and total hemocyte count (THC) in the stingless bee Partamona helleri. Foragers were exposed to lethal concentrations aimed to kill 5% (LC5) of CuSO4 (120¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) or spinosad (0.85¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) over a 24-h period. Glyphosate-exposed bees received the recommended label concentration (7400¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1), as they exhibited 100% survival after exposure. Ingestion of CuSO4 or glyphosate-treated diets by bees was reduced. Levels of NO and catalase (CAT) remained unaffected at 0¬†h or 24¬†h post-exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher at 0¬†h compared to 24¬†h, although insignificantly so when compared to the control. Exposure to CuSO4 reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity at 0¬†h but increased it after 24¬†h, for both CuSO4 and glyphosate. MDA levels decreased after 0¬†h exposure to CuSO4 or spinosad but increased after 24¬†h exposure to all tested agrochemicals. THC showed no difference among glyphosate or spinosad compared to the control or across time. However, CuSO4 exposure significantly increased THC. These findings shed light on the physiological responses of stingless bees to agrochemicals, crucial for understanding their overall health. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34790-w,31.0,42,54648,54658,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202610317&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-34790-w&partnerID=40&md5=b8e841d5900007b3da045b2bfa1ae36b,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'Sublethal effects', 'survival', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'catalase', 'Glyphosates', 'Weed control', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'Physiological models', 'Physiological response', 'metabolism', 'spinosad', 'biopesticide', 'immunity', 'physiological response', 'Oral exposure', 'blood cell', 'Hemocytes', 'Bioinsecticide', 'Herbicide', 'antioxidant', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Enzymes', 'Oxidative stress', 'Fertilizers', 'Antioxidants', 'Antioxidants enzymes', 'Bioinsecticides', 'Catalase', 'Cellular immunity', 'Cellulars', 'Leaf fertilizer', 'nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Total hemocyte counts']",,,,,0,140,0,

171,451,JOUR,Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Bachofer, S.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Pollution,"Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72¬†h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in¬†vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.105,220.0,,1264,1270,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999648368&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2016.10.105&partnerID=40&md5=a474edd83a460346afb01361a49d6299,Scopus,,,,,,0,142,0,

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2‚Äì5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health. N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid insecticides are much less toxic to honeybees and bumble bees than N-nitroguanidine compounds. Manjon et al. show that this results from differences in their efficiency of metabolism by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily, demonstrating their role as key determinants of bee sensitivity to this insecticide class. ¬© 2018 The Author(s)",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.cub.2018.02.045,28.0,7,1137,1143.e5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044610718&doi=10.1016%2fj.cub.2018.02.045&partnerID=40&md5=658fa8eb09e437446fa21b5f090a43ed,Scopus,,,,,,0,143,0,

In this article, we evaluated the effect of aerial sprays of the spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait GF-120 upon colonies of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona mexicana Gu√©rin (Hymenoptera: Apidae), an economically important and abundant species in some landscapes of Mexico, located in mango orchards. Colonies of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) were used for comparison. Eight colonies (four of A. mellifera and four of S. mexicana) were moved into each of two mango orchards, one was used as a control, with no insecticide application, and other received five weekly aerial sprays of GF-120. Foraging activity and strength of colonies of both species were measured nine times over the fruiting season, previous, during and after insecticide application. We did not find a significant difference in foraging activity and strength between exposed and control colonies of A. mellifera during the observation period. However, colonies of S. mexicana seemed to be affected by the exposure, as revealed by a reduction in colony strength. However, 1 yr later, with no insecticide applications, the colonies of both species were evaluated and found to be in good conditions. Our results showed that weekly aerial sprays of GF-120 are unlikely to generate acute poisoning in both species, even if in acute toxicity tests this product has been found to be highly active. ¬© The Author(s) 2018.

Only the parent compound and no metabolites were detected in nectar and pollen of these seed-treated sunflower plants (limit of detection <0.001 mg kg-1). In standard LD50 laboratory tests, imidacloprid showed high oral toxicity to honeybees (Apis mellifera), with LD50 values between 3.7 and 40.9 ng per bee, corresponding to a lethal food concentration between 0.14 and 1.57 mg kg-1. The residue level of imidacloprid in nectar and pollen of seed-treated sunflower plants in the field was negligible. Under field-growing conditions no residues were detected (limit of detection: 0.0015 mg kg-1) in either nectar or pollen. There were also no detectable residues in nectar and pollen of sunflowers planted as a succeeding crop in soils which previously had been cropped with imidacloprid seed-treated plants. Chronic feeding experiments with sunflower honey fortified with 0.002, 0.005, 0.010 and 0.020 mg kg-1 imidacloprid were conducted to assess potential long-term adverse effects on honeybee colonies. Testing end-points in this 39-day feeding study were mortality, feeding activity, wax/comb production, breeding performance and colony vitality. Even at the highest test concentration, imidacloprid showed no adverse effects on the development of the exposed bee colonies. This no-adverse-effect concentration of 0.020 mg kg-1 compares with a field residue level of less than 0.0015 mg kg-1 (= limit of detection in the field residue studies) which clearly shows that a sunflower seed dressing with imidacloprid poses no risk to honeybees.

We tested six different concentrations of spinosad for the first two analyses, followed by LC50 (7.7 mg L-1) for other assays. Spinosad ingestion decreased survival and food consumption. Exposure to spinosad LC50 reduced flight capacity, respiration rate, and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, this concentration increased glutathione S-transferase activity and the TAC of the brain. Notably, exposure to LC50 damaged mushroom bodies, reduced the total hemocyte count and granulocyte number, and increased the number of prohemocytes.

Imidacloprid is a widely used systemic insecticide that can be found in the pollen and nectar of plants and has the potential to negatively impact the development of bee larvae. We investigated the effects of oral exposure to a realistic field concentration (20.5 ng g‚àí1) of imidacloprid on the midgut and fat body of Apis mellifera worker larvae. Our results showed that larvae exposed to imidacloprid exhibited changes in the midgut epithelium, including disorganization of the brush border, nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasm vacuolization, and release of cell fragments indication cell death. Additionally, histochemical analysis revealed that the midgut brush border glycocalyx was disorganized in exposed larvae. The fat body cells of imidacloprid-exposed larvae had a decrease in the size of lipid droplets from 50 to 8 Œºm and increase of 100 % of protein content, suggesting possible responses to the stress caused by the insecticide. However, the expression of de cdc20 gene, which plays a role in cell proliferation, was not affected in the midgut and fat body of treated larvae.

However, these bees may be exposed to pesticides during foraging, which can affect both individuals and their colonies. One example comes from the use of pyraclostrobin (a fungicide) and thiamethoxam (an insecticide) for pest control in pepper crops, which F. varia visits. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined sublethal effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) (0.000543 ng a.i./¬µL) and pyraclostrobin (PYR) (1.5 ng i.a./¬µL) on the morphology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of F. varia workers. Results showed that both pesticides, regardless of the exposure time (through feeding during 48 h or 96 h), disturbed the morphology of the analyzed organs. Specifically, F. varia exposed orally to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin, either alone or in combination, exhibited a higher rate of damage to the midgut (e.g., vacuolization, apocrine secretion, and cellular elimination) compared to the bees in the control groups, both after 48 h and 96 h of exposure. In Malpighian tubules, vacuolation is the only damage present. As the observed morphological alterations likely compromise the excretion and absorption functions, exposure to pyraclostrobin and thiamethoxam may lead to disturbances at both the individual and colony levels.

However, in field realistic conditions mixtures of products classified as harmless to bees can lead to a synergistic increase of toxicity on honey¬†bees, as known for ergosterol¬†biosynthesis-inhibiting (EBI) fungicides combined with pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. For substances like fertilizers, usually no information on potential side effects on bees is available. Initially, effects from tank mixes containing insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers were investigated under laboratory conditions by use of a spray chamber contact test. For selected combinations, higher tier studies were carried out. Mixtures containing thiacloprid, boscalid and dimoxystrobin with boron fertilizers showed no increase of mortality. In contrast, tank mixes of thiacloprid formulations and EBI-fungicides resulted within 24¬†h in synergistic mortality increase in laboratory, semi-field and field. Actually, a short time interval of 24¬†h between individually applied potentially synergistic products like pyrethroid insecticides and EBI fungicides led to an increase of mortality up to 100% under laboratory conditions, indicating that the detoxification was still ongoing, resulting in an increased susceptibility for other stressors during the metabolization process. In conclusion, tank mixtures do not always lead to an increase of honey bee¬†toxicity. However, former published findings about synergistic impacts between neonicotinoides and EBI-fungicides could be confirmed. The findings of our and other higher tier studies finally prompted the competent regulatory authority (BVL) to regulate these mixtures by restriction NB6613 since September 2018.

Critically, we know little about the magnitude and sources of risk to honeybees compared with other bees during crop pollination. To compare pesticide exposure and risk across wild and managed bees, we sampled the main bee groups present during bloom in 20 apple orchards, including managed honeybees (Apis mellifera), managed bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens), wild mining bees (Andrena spp. and Andrena [Melandrena] spp.), bumblebee foundress queens (Bombus impatiens) and eastern carpenter bees (Xylocopa virginica). We screened all bees for 92 pesticides and computed a Risk Quotient using available toxicity data (honeybee LD50s), adjusting for differences in toxicity known to scale with body mass. To gain insight into exposure origin, we compared residues in bees to those in focal orchard apple and dandelion flowers. Nearly all bee samples contained pesticides (95%), with the average contamination level ranging from 7.1 ¬± 2.8 parts per billion (ppb) in B. impatiens workers to 388.4 ¬± 146.2 ppb in Andrena. Exposure profiles were similar for all bees except A. mellifera, whose unique exposure profile included high levels of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam. All bee groups except wild B. impatiens queens had at least one sample exceeding a US Environmental Protection Agency or European Food Safety Authority exposure level of concern. Apis mellifera experienced significantly greater risk than other bee groups, with 63% and 81% of samples exceeding an acute or chronic exposure level of concern, respectively. Risk to honeybees was driven primarily by high thiamethoxam levels not found in focal orchard flowers and likely originating outside the orchard. Synthesis and applications: We find that pesticide exposure and risk differ between honeybees and other managed and wild bees during apple pollination. Furthermore, pesticide exposure is a landscape-scale phenomenon and therefore measures to reduce exposure must consider the surroundings beyond focal farms. Limiting orchard sprays, while reducing on-farm exposures, will not protect far-foraging bees from off-farm exposures such as thiamethoxam, which we hypothesize is coming from nearby seed-treated corn fields planted during apple bloom. ¬© 2024 The Authors.

There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions.

Bumblebees are heavily preferred species all over the world in order to ensure pollination in plant production. In this study, sublethal effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the brain of Bombus terrestris workers were analyzed. Suspensions (1/1000, 1/100, 1/10) of the maximum recommended dose of thiamethoxam were applied to the workers. 48 h after spraying, morphological effects on the brains of workers were studied. According to area measurements of ICC's of Kenyon cells, there was a significant difference between 1/10 dose and all groups. On the other hand, areas of INC's of Kenyon cells showed a significant difference between the control group and all dose groups. Neuropil disorganization in the calyces increased gradually and differed significantly between the groups and was mostly detected at the highest dose (1/10).

Toxicological assessment is therefore crucial for understanding the overall agrochemical risks to stingless bees. Therefore, the lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals commonly used in crops (copper sulfate, glyphosate, and spinosad) on the behavior and gut microbiota of the stingless bee, Partamona helleri, were assessed using chronic exposure during the larval stage. When used at the field-recommended rates, both copper sulfate (200¬†¬µg of active ingredient/bee; a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) and spinosad (8.16 a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) caused a decrease in bee survival, while glyphosate (148 a.i ¬µg bee‚àí1) did not show any significant effects. No significant adverse effects on bee development were observed in any treatment with CuSO4 or glyphosate, but spinosad (0.08 or 0.03 a.i ¬µg bee ‚àí1) increased the number of deformed bees and reduced their body mass. Agrochemicals changed the behavior of bees and composition of the gut microbiota of adult bees, and metals such as copper accumulated in the bees‚Äô bodies.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (LC50/100: 0.014651 ng imidacloprid mu L-1 diet) on the distribution of certain proteins identified in the brain of Apis mellifera worker bees using a MALDI-imaging approach. This technique enables proteomic analysis of tissues in situ by monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of the biochemical processes occurring at a specific time in specific brain neuropils. For this purpose, foraging bees were exposed to an 8-day diet containing a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid corresponding to the LC50/100. Bees were collected on day 8 of exposure, and their brains analyzed using protein density maps. RESULTS The results showed that exposure to imidacloprid led to a series of biochemical changes, including alterations in synapse regulation, apoptosis regulation and oxidative stress, which may adversely impair the physiology of these colony bees. CONCLUSION Worker bee contact with even tiny amounts of imidacloprid had potent effects leading to the overexpression of a series of proteins related to important cellular processes that were possibly damaged by the insecticide.

However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/jemt.22339,77.0,4,274,281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896317005&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22339&partnerID=40&md5=52d578be248c256349e4f0308aa95ff2,Scopus,,,,,,0,158,0,
25,305,JOUR,"Neonicotinoid pesticide applications affect pollinator abundance and visitation, leading to implications for sunflower production (Helianthus annuus L.)","['Saleem, M.S.', 'Akbar, M.F.', 'Javed, M.A.', 'Sultan, A.']",Cogent Food and Agriculture,"Pesticides are considered a risk to pollinators; however, little is known about the possible effects of their injudicious use on pollinators, including the ecosystem services provided to crops and wildflowers. Recently, great attention has been paid to the effects of neonicotinoids pesticides on pollinators and their potential role in harming the health of bees all over the world. Sunflowers, being self-incompatible plants, rely on insects, primarily bees, for effective cross-pollination and successful seed-set. Ensuring the presence of sufficient pollinators in the field is crucial for facilitating pollen movement between flowers and promoting optimal seed development. However, the reliance on insect-mediated cross-pollination also makes sunflowers susceptible to pest attacks, which can negatively impact seed production. To mitigate these potential threats and achieve increased seed yields, careful consideration is given to the judicious use of pesticides. Striking the right balance between providing adequate pollinators and implementing appropriate pest management strategies is vital for maximizing sunflower crop productivity. To reveal such potential impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides, we undergo the current study that aimed to estimate flower visitation and pollination in a sunflower crop by applying three neonicotinoid insecticides i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, including the control group for two years i.e. 2020, and 2021. In all experimental plots, we quantified floral visitors for fourteen days at three different times (8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm). Floral visitors were divided into three groups, Apis bees, Non-Apis bees, and butterflies. After the maturation period, the achenes from each capitulum were separated and brought for weight. We discovered that this study confirmed the adverse effect of neonicotinoids pesticides on sunflower production. Our research revealed that the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam had a negative impact on the visitation of Apis bees, with reductions of 19%, 18.5%, and 23% respectively, as compared to the control group during the year 2020. Furthermore, these pesticides also caused a decrease in the visitation of Non-Apis bees by 15%, 15%, and 17% respectively. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 17.4%, 14.6%, and 15.8% for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam respectively. Based on our research conducted in the year 2021, the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam caused a reduction of 22.5%, 24%, and 25.5% respectively in the visitation of Apis bees, as compared to the control group. Similarly, non-Apis bees experienced a decrease in visitation by 19.5%, 23.5%, and 25% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 18.2%, 22.2%, and 26% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the use of these pesticides affected the diversity of floral visitors and contributed to a decline in the number of fruit during the year 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the abundance of floral visitors, the mass of fruits, and the quantity of oil in the seeds were significantly lower after treatment with neonicotinoid pesticides, thus evidencing its negative effect on sunflower productivity.

The insecticide imidacloprid has shown a drastic effect on the olfactory behavior of A. m. jemenitica in the harsh arid climatic conditions of central Saudi Arabia. The oral feeding of single imidacloprid sub-lethal doses (1.0¬†ng, 0.5¬†ng, or 0.1¬†ng) under laboratory conditions significantly impaired associative learning during the 2nd and 3rd conditioning trials compared to control bees (0¬†ng).

Even the lowest dose (0.1¬†ng/bee) can significantly impair the bees‚Äô ability to learn and memorize. This impairment effect was dose dependent and increased with increasing doses. The higher dose (1.0¬†ng) completely impaired the learning but still showed a little memory and reflected the potential recovery of bees from insecticide-induced impairment with the passage of time. To our knowledge, this is the first study in A. m. jemenitica that demonstrated the drastic effect of neonicotinoids on associative learning in indigenous bees.

At the highest doses, we observed larvae and pupae with shorter and longer development times, respectively, and the formation of smaller and asymmetric specimens. Evidently, we need to consider that thiamethoxam reaches the pollen and nectar at residual levels, and that they are processed by nurse bees before destined for offspring. Nevertheless, our findings suggest a warning, since the individuals had their biological parameters affected by thiamethoxam, when exposed to doses at field-realistic levels. ¬© 2016, INRA, DIB and Springer-Verlag France.",2016///,2016,10.1007/s13592-015-0424-4,47.0,6,729,738,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994493281&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-015-0424-4&partnerID=40&md5=e4cfe9505adbcf809d32f9806c06e6c4,Scopus,,,,,,0,161,0,

[Hymenoptera: Apidael) as a surrogate for other bee species. There is uncertainty in extrapolating honey bee toxicity data to bumble bees due to differences in life history strategies, food consumption, and nest structure. Here we evaluated the design of a queenless bumble bee microcolony test that could be considered for generating larval toxicity data. Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony. Our data suggest that the microcolony study is only appropriate to assess brood effects to bumble bees for substances with low toxicity to adults, as demonstrated with diflubenzuron.

Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25¬†¬µg IMI/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose of 7.3 ng/bee/d for all responses, was measured. The overall weight of evidence indicates that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to IMI from its use as a seed treatment. Exposures via dusts from currently used seed coatings present a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure is via uptake in plants that are a source of pollen or nectar for honeybees. There were few higher-tier observational (ecoepidemiological) studies conducted with IMI. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable, but the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion‚Äìthat IMI had no adverse effects on viability of the honeybee colony.

To test the effect of sublethal doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid and carbaryl on the lifespan and health of honey bees, workers were orally and topically exposed to LD5 doses of these insecticides. The survivorship of treated bees was monitored and the expression of three immune-related genes, hymenoptaecin (AmHym), basket (AmBask) and lysozyme (AmLyso2) was analyzed at 24 and 72 hours post treatment (hpt), as well as that of the antioxidant-related gene vitellogenin (AmVit2), the poly-U binding factor (AmPuf68), and the detoxification gene cytochrome P450 (AmCYP9Q3). The three insecticides significantly reduced the length of life of bees but the mode of application did not affect survivorship.

Bee larvae were exposed to control, low (3 or 6 ppb), intermediate (30 ppb), or high (300 ppb) doses of either imidacloprid or clothianidin in pollen. Field experiments on both bee species involved injecting the pollen provisions with the corresponding pesticide. Only O. lignaria was used for the laboratory experiments, which entailed both injecting the bee's own pollen provisions and replacing the pollen provision with a preblended pollen mixture containing imidacloprid. Larval development, emergence, weight, and mortality were monitored and analyzed. There were no lethal effects found for either imidacloprid or clothianidin on O. lignaria and M. rotundata.

Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108844,238.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089262289&doi=10.1016%2fj.cbpc.2020.108844&partnerID=40&md5=01cf9a35d7021a7a9303c0b2f05f247f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'cyhalothrin', 'nonhuman', 'pyrethroid', 'Apis mellifera', 'mortality', 'priority journal', 'metabolism', 'cytochrome P450', 'insecticide resistance', 'enzyme activity', 'organophosphate insecticide', 'carbamic acid derivative', 'age', 'oxamyl', 'esterase', 'Esterases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'drug sensitivity', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'aging', 'Aging', 'enzymology', 'acephate', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Invertase', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'Detoxification enzymes', 'Age', 'Age Factors', 'beta fructofuranosidase', 'beta-Fructofuranosidase', 'Soluble protein', 'Worker']",,,,,0,167,0,

Several potential contributing factors have been identified, and exposure to pesticides is of increasing concern. In maize fields, foraging bees are exposed to residual concentrations of insecticides such as neonicotinoids used for seed coating. Highly toxic to bees, neonicotinoids are also reported to increase AChE activity in other invertebrates exposed to sub-lethal doses. The purpose of this study was therefore to test if the honey bee's AChE activity could be altered by neonicotinoid compounds and to explore possible effects of other common products used in maize fields: atrazine and glyphosate. One week prior to pollen shedding, beehives were placed near three different field types: certified organically grown maize, conventionally grown maize or non-cultivated. At the same time, caged bees were exposed to increasing sub-lethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and clothianidin) and herbicides (atrazine and glyphosate) under controlled conditions. While increased AChE activity was found in all fields after 2 weeks of exposure, bees close to conventional maize crops showed values higher than those in both organic maize fields and non-cultivated areas. In caged bees, AChE activity increased in response to neonicotinoids, and a slight decrease was observed by glyphosate. These results are discussed with regard to AChE activity as a potential biomarker of exposure for neonicotinoids. ¬© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013///,2013,10.1007/s11356-013-1568-2,20.0,8,5603,5614,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880641487&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-013-1568-2&partnerID=40&md5=827e517d67ade48be6e6b971340c7614,Scopus,,,,,,0,169,0,

Honeybees inevitably come into contact with environmental stressors that are not intended to target honeybees, such as pesticides. Although large-scale losses of honeybee colonies are thought to be associated with viruses, these viruses usually lead to covert infections and to not cause acute damage if the bees do not encounter outside stressors. To reveal the potential relationship between acute pesticides and viruses, we applied different doses of imidacloprid to adult bees that were primarily infected with low levels (4.3 √ó 105 genome copies) of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) to observe whether the acute oral toxicity of imidacloprid was able to elevate the level of CBPV. Here, we found that the titer of CBPV was significantly elevated in adult bees after 96 h of acute treatment with imidacloprid at the highest dose 66.9 ng/bee compared with other treatments and controls. Our study provides clear evidence that exposure to acute high doses of imidacloprid in honeybees persistently infected by CBPV can exert a remarkably negative effect on honeybee survival. These results imply that acute environmental stressors might be one of the major accelerators causing rapid viral replication, which may progress to cause mass proliferation and dissemination and lead to colony decline. The present study will be useful for better understanding the harm caused by this pesticide, especially regarding how honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might be altered by acute pesticide exposure. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.258,630.0,,487,494,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042713901&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.02.258&partnerID=40&md5=6241bf25d47c1976be38365af00d21b6,Scopus,,,,,,0,170,0,
259,539,JOUR,The novel pesticide flupyradifurone (Sivanto) affects honeybee motor abilities,"['Hesselbach, H', 'Scheiner, R']",ECOTOXICOLOGY,"Honeybees and other pollinators are threatened by changing landscapes and pesticides resulting from intensified agriculture. In 2018 the European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the name of Sivanto was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless, flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone (830 mu mol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2 mu g/bee). These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0-1.75 mu g) continuously over 24h with food the observed effects are slighter. For comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this pesticide (4ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.",2019/04//,2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02028-y,28.0,3,354,366,,,,0963-9292,WOS:000462001000009,,,0,171,0,

As with pyrethroids, the metabolization of chloronicotinyl compounds involves monooxygenases, which are known to be inhibited by some ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitor (EBI) fungicides potentially co-applied with these insecticides. The potential synergistic enhancement of the toxicity of thiacloprid to honeybees when co-applied with such fungicides was therefore studied under laboratory and semi-field conditions. Fungicides of other chemical classes were also examined for synergistic potential to reveal other metabolic interactions. In the laboratory, only a slight synergistic effect was observed with the anilinopyrimidine fungicide examined, while a significant enhancement of thiacloprid toxicity to honeybees was found with EBI fungicides. In three tunnel tests conducted under different environmental conditions to simulate field exposure, no increased mortality was observed when honeybees were directly sprayed with thiacloprid (Calypso) alone or in combination with the EBI fungicide tebuconazole (250 g litre(-1) EW, Folicur(R)). There was also no synergized reduction in the foraging intensity on the treated crop. In general, the foraging intensity decreased after thiacloprid treatment but was restored within 24-48 h. The hive vitality was not affected by either thiacloprid or its tank mix with tebuconazole. Our results suggest that, at the recommended use rates, thiacloprid poses a negligible lethal risk to honeybees when applied either alone or in tank mixes with fungicides of various chemical classes.

In recent years, neonicotinoids are widely used against a broad spectrum sucking pests. However, they also pose a major threat to the beekeeping industry. The present study aimed to quantify the impact of thiamethoxam, a second-generation, broad-spectrum neonicotinoid on foraging behavior, colony performance, and survival of Apis mellifera L. in mustard crop under semi-field (cage) and field conditions. Under semi-field conditions, the foraging activity of A. mellifera on mustard bloom reduced significantly on the 2nd day after spray of thiamethoxam as compared to pre-count and control. Significant decrease in brood area (7th to 21st day), nectar stores (7th to 28th day), and pollen stores (7th to 21st day) were also recorded after the spray. The bee mortality under semi-field conditions was significantly higher on the 1st and 2nd day after spray in comparison to control. Under field conditions, average bee activity remained statistically low up to the 12th day after spray on mustard bloom in comparison to pre-count and control. The effect of thiamethoxam under field conditions was less pronounced for bee mortality and colony parameters. Based on LD50, thiamethoxam was proved toxic to adults and larvae of A. mellifera. ¬© 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2022///,2022,10.1007/s11356-021-16426-5,29.0,7,10826,10837,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115082076&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-021-16426-5&partnerID=40&md5=3f3892843203ae42d52f344cb4e47f4c,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'survival', 'honey', 'thiamethoxam', 'nectar', 'mortality', 'Plant Nectar', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Pollinators', 'apiculture', 'Bee activity', 'Mortality', 'Pesticide toxicity']",,,,,0,173,0,

In this study, we focus on the second-generation neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, which is currently widely used in agriculture to protect crops. Using high-throughput RNA-Seq, we investigated the transcriptome profile of honey bees after subchronic exposure to 10 ppb thiamethoxam over 10 d. In total, 609 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, of which 225 were upregulated and 384 were downregulated. Several genes, including vitellogenin, CSP3, defensin-1, Mrjp1, and Cyp6as5 were selected and further validated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays. The functions of some DEGs were identified, and Gene Ontology-enrichment analysis showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly linked to metabolism, biosynthesis, and translation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis showed that thiamethoxam affected biological processes including ribosomes, the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, tyrosine metabolism pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and drug metabolism.

Therefore, the sublethal effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on the survival and morphological parameters of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris were investigated in the present study. Cells from both non-target organs (Malpighian tubules and midgut) and target organs (brain) were analyzed for morphological alterations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The findings showed that when M. scutellaris foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100 = 0.000543 ng a. i./ŒºL), longevity was not reduced but brain function was affected, even with the non-target organs attempting to detoxify. The cellular damage in all the organs was mostly reflected in irregular nuclei shape and condensed chromatin, indicating cell death. The most frequent impairments in the Malpighian tubules were loss of microvilli, disorganization of the basal labyrinth, and cytoplasmic loss. These characteristics are related to an attempt by the cells to increase the excretion process, probably because of the high number of toxic molecules that reach the Malpighian tubules and need to be secreted. In general, damages that compromise the absorption of nutrients, excretion, memory, and learning processes, which are essential for the survival of M. scutellaris, were found.

Treatments with individual Bracket (acephate), Karate (Œ≥-cyhalothrin), Vydate (oxamyl), Domark (tetraconazole), and Roundup (glyphosate) at residue level had a mortality range of 1.3-13.3%, statistically similar to that of control (P>0.05). The additive/synergistic toxicity was not detected from binary mixtures of Advise with different classes of pesticides at residue levels. The feeding of the mixture of all seven pesticides increased mortality to 53%, significantly higher than Advise only but still without synergism. Enzymatic data showed that activities of invertase, glutathione S-Transferase, and acetylcholinesterase activities in imidacloprid-Treated survivors were mostly similar to those found in control. Esterase activity mostly increased, but was significantly suppressed by Bracket (acephate). The immunity-related phenoloxidase activity in imidacloprid-Treated survivors tended to be lower, but most treatments were statistically similar to the control. Increase of cytochrome P450 activity was correlated with Advise concentrations and reached significant difference at 56 mg/L (12 ppm a.i.).

However, the impacts of parasitic Nosema ceranae to host fitness during long-term pesticide exposure-induced stress is largely unknown. In this study, the effects of chronic exposure to a sublethal dose of dinotefuran, in the presence or absence of N. ceranae, was examined in terms of survival, food consumption, detoxification enzyme activities and gut microbial community. The interaction between dinotefuran and Nosema ceranae on the survival of honey bee was synergistic. Co-exposure to dinotefuran and N. ceranae led to less food consumption and greater changes of enzyme activities involved in defenses against oxidative stress. Particularly, N. ceranae and dinotefuran-N. ceranae co-exposure significantly impacted the gut microbiota structure and richness in adult honey bees, while dinotefuran alone did not show significant alternation of core gut microbiota compared to the control group. We herein demonstrated that chronical exposure to dinotefuran decreases honey bee's survival but is not steadily associated with the gut microbiota dysbiosis; by contrast, N. ceranae parasitism plays a dominant role in the combination in influencing the gut microbial community of the host honey bee.

In this study, adults of A. cerana were exposed to acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole by contaminated syrup at field-realistic concentrations for 10¬†days. Results indicated that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole chronic exposure did not affect honey bees‚Äô survival and food consumption, whereas difenoconazole decreased the weight of honey bees. 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that difenoconazole and the mixture of difenoconazole and acetamiprid decreased the diversity index and shaped the composition of gut bacteria microbiota, whereas acetamiprid did not impact the gut bacterial community. The ITS sequence data showed that neither of the two pesticides affected the fungal community structure. Meanwhile, we also observed that acetamiprid or difenoconazole significantly altered the expression of genes related to detoxification and immunity in honey bees‚Äô tissues. Furthermore, we observed that the adverse effect of the acetamiprid and difenoconazole mixture on honey bees‚Äô health was greater than that of a single mixture. Taken together, our study demonstrates that acetamiprid and/or difenoconazole exposure at field-realistic concentrations induced changes to the honey bee gut microbiome and gene expression.

82,362,JOUR,Metabolic profiling of Apis mellifera larvae treated with sublethal acetamiprid doses,"['Shi, X.', 'Shi, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Wu, X.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Acetamiprid is a neonicotinoid insecticide used in crop protection worldwide. Such widespread application can pose risks to pollinator insects, particularly to honeybees (Apis mellifera); therefore, the evaluation of the harmful effects of acetamiprid is necessary. Recent studies report behavior and gene expression dysfunction in honeybees, related to acetamiprid contamination. However, most studies do not consider potential metabolism disorders. To examine the effects of sublethal acetamiprid doses on the hemolymph metabolism of honeybees, worker bee larvae(2 days old) were fed with sucrose water containing different concentrations of acetamiprid (0, 5, and 25 mg/L) until capped (6 days old). The hemolymph (200 ŒºL) of freshly capped larvae was collected for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Overall, increasing acetamiprid exposure induced greater metabolic variations in worker bee larvae(treated groups compared to untreated). In the positive ion mode, 36 common differential metabolites in the acetamiprid-treated groups were screened from the identified differential metabolites. Of these, 19 metabolites were upregulated, and 17 were downregulated. 10 common differential metabolites were screened in the negative ion mode. 3 metabolites were upregulated, and 7 metabolites were downregulated. These common metabolites included traumatic acid, indole etc. These commonly differentiated metabolites were classified as compounds with biological roles, lipids, and phytochemical compounds, and others. The metabolic pathways of common differentiated metabolites with significant differences (P < 0.05) included the metabolism of tryptophan, purines, phenylalanine, etc. As the concentration of acetamiprid increased, the content of traumatic acid increased, the content of tryptophan metabolite L-kynurenine and indole decreased, and the content of lipids also decreased. Our results revealed that the damage to honeybee larvae increased when the acetamiprid solution formulations residue in their food had a concentration higher than 5 mg/L, causing metabolic disorders in various substances in larvae. Analysis of these metabolic processes can provide a theoretical basis for further research on the metabolism of acetamiprid-treated honeybees and elucidate the detoxification mechanisms. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114716,254.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149329442&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.114716&partnerID=40&md5=1a2438fb811339d64936a616dc9239b0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'honeybee', 'sucrose', 'larva', 'Larva', 'comparative study', 'liquid chromatography', 'Ecotoxicology', 'sublethal dose', 'down regulation', 'unclassified drug', 'metabolism', 'upregulation', 'detoxification', 'hemolymph', 'Honeybee larvae', 'indole', 'insect larva', 'kynurenine', 'lipid', 'Lipids', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometry', 'metabolic disorder', 'metabolic fingerprinting', 'metabolic regulation', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'phenylalanine', 'phytochemical', 'purine', 'sugar intake', 'traumatic acid', 'tryptophan', 'Tryptophan', 'unsaturated fatty acid']",,,,,0,181,0,

Although most studies have investigated insecticide residues in honeybees and bumblebees, few have focused on non-Apis solitary bees, which are considered essential pollinators in the field. Most non-Apis bees are solitary and build their nests in the ground or in tree holes, therefore insecticide exposure pathways would differ from those of honeybees and bumblebees. We analyzed the residues of 20 insecticides in Osmia cornifrons bees and their pollen-provisions and nesting materials, along with adult honeybees, soil, and wildflowers collected in four apple orchards in two regions in Japan. Few insecticides were common among adult bees, pollen-provisions, and wildflowers. Insecticides applied in orchards were detected at high frequency: chlorantraniliprole, flubendiamide, and diazinon were detected in almost all samples. Insecticides without a known history of application were detected from various samples at frequencies ranging from 0% to 100%. Even in orchards without a known history of insecticide application, clothianidin was detected in many sample types and at high concentration. A purple deadnettle sample had the highest concentration at 17.5 mg/kg. These results highlight the complexity of pathways of insecticide exposure to O. cornifrons in the environment because insecticides may remain in the environment for long periods and wild bees may forage farther than previously known distances. Furthermore, each sample type contained different insecticides, so wild bees may have been exposed to different insecticides at different life stages. Future research should prioritize wide-scale measurements of insecticide residues in field conditions and toxicity testing with multiple exposures at different life stages of target species.

While short-term laboratory studies on commercially bred species (principally honeybees and bumblebees) have identified sub-lethal effects, there is no strong evidence linking these insecticides to losses of the majority of wild bee species. We relate 18 years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up to cause losses of bee biodiversity.

Thiamethoxam,"['Stephenson, G.L.', 'Solomon, K.R.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess several higher-tier studies on the effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5¬†¬µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6¬†ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1¬†g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicates that TMX has no adverse effects on viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the treatment of seeds with thiamethoxam, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388568,20.0,06-Jul,365,382,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036570302&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388568&partnerID=40&md5=caf3b85e15ff10f896cae621455c9207,Scopus,,,,,,0,185,0,
21,301,JOUR,Imidacloprid decreases honey bee survival rates but does not affect the gut microbiome,"['Raymann, K.', 'Motta, E.V.S.', 'Girard, C.', 'Riddington, I.M.', 'Dinser, J.A.', 'Moran, N.A.']",Applied and Environmental Microbiology,"Accumulating evidence suggests that pesticides have played a role in the increased rate of honey bee colony loss. One of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Although the primary mode of action of imidacloprid is on the insect nervous system, it has also been shown to cause changes in insects' digestive physiology and alter the microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The honey bee gut microbiome plays a major role in bee health. Although many studies have shown that imidacloprid affects honey bee behavior, its impact on the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the gut microbiome composition, survivorship, and susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees. Consistent with other studies, we show that imidacloprid exposure results in an elevated mortality of honey bees in the hive and increases the susceptibility to infection by pathogens. However, we did not find evidence that imidacloprid affects the gut bacterial community of honey bees. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that honey bee gut bacteria can grow in the presence of imidacloprid, and we found some evidence that imidacloprid can be metabolized in the bee gut environment. However, none of the individual bee gut bacterial species tested could metabolize imidacloprid, suggesting that the observed metabolism of imidacloprid within in vitro bee gut cultures is not caused by the gut bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that imidacloprid causes increased mortality in honey bees, but this mortality does not appear to be linked to the microbiome. ¬© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",2018///,2018,10.1128/AEM.00545-18,84.0,13,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049378480&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00545-18&partnerID=40&md5=194e8ae4e1486d395f126789a311f728,Scopus,,,,,,0,186,0,

Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL‚àí1), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL‚àí1) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL‚àí1) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, RoundUp¬Æ, was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; RoundUp¬Æ showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111108,204.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089267499&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111108&partnerID=40&md5=9cbd45dfe10ca45df14df9eba30305df,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pollination', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'drug effect', 'forager', 'learning', 'Learning', 'physiology', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'lifespan', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'short term exposure', 'aversive behavior', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosate', 'long term exposure', 'agrochemical', 'assessment method', 'lethality', 'ecotoxicity', 'Apis mellifera, imidacloprid', 'Aversive conditioning', 'circadian rhythm', 'crop production', 'ethion', 'Ethion', 'lethal concentration', 'motility', 'movement (physiology)', 'newborn', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'phosphorothioic acid derivative']",,,,,0,188,0,

The combined effects of pesticides, however, are not measured in the current risk assessment schemes. Additionally, the sublethal effects of pesticides on a variety of physiological processes are poorly recognized in bees, especially in non-Apis solitary bees. In this study, we used a full-factorial design to examine the main and interactive effects of three insecticide formulations with different modes of action (Mospilan 20 SP, Sherpa 100 EC, and Dursban 480 EC) on bee biochemical processes. We measured acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and esterase (EST) activities, as well as a nonenzymatic biomarker associated with energy metabolism, i.e., ATP level. All studied endpoints were affected by Sherpa 100 EC, and the activities of AChE and EST as well as ATP levels were affected by Dursban 480 EC. Moreover, complex interactions between all three insecticides affected ATP levels, showing outcomes that cannot be predicted when testing each insecticide separately.

Population reductions have been documented for the agriculturally important honey bee (Apis mellifera), and other bee species such as bumble bees that are also critical for pollinating crops and natural landscapes. A variety of factors contribute to the observed population reductions, including exposure to agrochemicals. In recent decades, neonicotinoid pesticide use has dramatically increased, as have concerns regarding the safety of these chemicals for pollinator health. Here we assessed the toxicity of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid to the bumble bee Bombus impatiens, a species commercially available for use in agricultural settings in North America. Using the microcolony model, we examined nest growth, development and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup (11,300 Œºg/L) significantly impacted nest growth and development, and ultimately drone production, and exposure to 1,130 Œºg/L acetamiprid also significantly decreased drone production. The no observable adverse effect level was 113 Œºg/L.

The nectar- and water-collecting, and climbing abilities of bees are crucial to the survival of the bees and the execution of responsibilities in bee colonies. Besides behavioral impact, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid, especially by the way of RNA-seq at the transcriptomic level, are limited. We treated Apis mellifera L. with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) and determined the effect on behaviors and the transcriptomic changes. The sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid had a limited impact on the survival and syrup consumption of bees, but caused a significant increase in water consumption. Moreover, the climbing ability was significantly impaired by 10 ppb imidacloprid at 8 d. In the RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment indicated a significant down-regulation of muscle-related genes, which might contribute to the impairment in climbing ability of bees. The enriched GO terms were attributed to the up-regulated ribosomal protein genes. Considering the ribosomal and extra-ribosomal functions of the ribosomal proteins, we hypothesized that imidacloprid also causes cell dysfunction. Our findings further enhance the understanding of imidacloprid sublethal toxicity. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-16245-0,7.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034768834&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-017-16245-0&partnerID=40&md5=eeec2573251579eefbfba56e878b1c97,Scopus,,,,,,0,191,0,

Therefore, our objective is the utilization of video-tracking to quantify how the acute oral exposure to different doses (0.1‚Äì2 ng/bee) of the neonicotinoid ‚Äúclothianidin‚Äù influences the locomotor activity of honeybees in a time course experiment. The total distance moved, resting time as well as the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down are measured. Our results show that bees exposed to acute sublethal doses of clothianidin exhibit a significant increase in the total distance moved after 30 and 60 min of the treatment at the highest dose (2 ng/bee). Nevertheless, a reduction of the total distance is observed at this dose 90 min post-treatment compared to the distance of the same group after 30 min, where the treated bees show an arched abdomen and start to lose their postural control. The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period. Moreover, a reduction in the resting time and increase of the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down at these doses are found. Furthermore, significant effects on the tested parameters are observed at the dose (0.5 ng/bee) first at 60 min post-treatment compared to untreated bees. The lowest dose (0.1 ng/bee) has non-significant effects on the motor activity of honeybees compared to untreated bees over the experimental period. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.047,147.0,,200,205,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027974937&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2017.08.047&partnerID=40&md5=1d3554268e9f79afb053201c0286a8eb,Scopus,,,,,,0,192,0,

Samples were collected from small plot evaluations of seed treatments and from commercial fields in agricultural production areas in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In total, 560 samples were analyzed for concentrations of clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and their metabolites. These induded pollen from corn and cotton, nectar from cotton, flowers from soybean, honey bees, Apis mellifera L., and pollen carried by foragers returning to hives, preplanting and in-season soil samples, and wild flowers adjacent to recently planted fields. Neonicotinoid insecticides were detected at a level of 1 ng/g or above in 23% of wild flower samples around recently planted fields, with an average detection level of about 10 ng/g. We detected neonicotinoid insecticides in the soil of production fields prior to planting at an average concentration of about 10 ng/g, and over 80% of the samples having some insecticide present. Only 5% of foraging honey bees tested positive for the presence of neonicotinoid insecticides, and there was only one trace detection (< 1 ng/g) in pollen being carried by those bees. Soybean flowers, cotton pollen, and cotton nectar contained little or no neonicotinoids resulting from insecticide seed treatments. Average levels of neonicotinoid insecticides in corn pollen ranged from less than 1 to 6 ng/g. The highest neonicotinoid concentrations were found in soil collected during early flowering from insecticide seed treatment trials. However, these levels were generally not well correlated with neonicotinoid concentrations in flowers, pollen, or nectar.

The extent to which different bee species are affected by these chemicals, largely depends on the concentrations and type of exposure. We quantified the presence of selected pesticide compounds in the pollen of two different entomophilous crops; oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and broad bean (Vicia faba). Sampling was performed in 12 sites in Ireland and our results were compared with the pollen loads of honey bees and bumble bees actively foraging on those crops in those same sites. Detections were compound specific, and the timing of pesticide application in relation to sampling likely influenced the final residue contamination levels. Most detections originated from compounds that were not recently applied on the fields, and samples from B. napus fields were more contaminated compared to those from V. faba fields. Crop pollen was contaminated only with fungicides, honey bee pollen loads contained mainly fungicides, while more insecticides were detected in bumble bee pollen loads. The highest number of compounds and most detections were observed in bumble bee pollen loads, where notably, all five neonicotinoids assessed (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were detected despite the no recent application of these compounds on the fields where samples were collected. The concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides were positively correlated with the number of wild plant species present in the bumble bee-collected pollen samples, but this relationship could not be verified for honey bees. The compounds azoxystrobin, boscalid and thiamethoxam formed the most common pesticide combination in pollen. Our results raise concerns about potential long-term bee exposure to multiple residues and question whether honey bees are suitable surrogates for pesticide risk assessments for all bee species. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166214,896.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168804307&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166214&partnerID=40&md5=00431f4815c28188a444632c9c984d06,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'Crops', 'foraging behavior', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'clothianidin', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'pesticide residue', 'honey', 'thiamethoxam', 'agricultural land', 'chemistry', 'Honey bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'bumblebee', 'thiacloprid', 'unclassified drug', 'animal pollination', 'Contamination', 'Pollinators', 'contamination', 'Pollinator', 'fungicide', 'Exposed to', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'pesticide application', 'crop', 'rapeseed', 'Honey', 'Brassica napus', 'quantitative analysis', 'sampling', 'Agricultural environments', 'Ireland', 'correlation analysis', 'azoxystrobin', 'Bumble bee', 'Agricultural areas', 'Pollen contamination', 'Vicia faba', 'wild plant']",,,,,0,195,0,

However, limited information is available on the pesticide effects on solitary bees, especially in Neotropical countries. In this scenario, this study evaluated the survival and histopathological effects caused by the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) in the midgut and parietal fat body of the solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male newly-emerged bees were orally exposed for 48 h to the pesticides, or alone or in combination, under laboratory conditions. The exposure to the insecticide reduced the survival of males, while the mixture reduced survival in both sexes. Acetamiprid promoted a reduction in the number of regenerative nests in the midgut, alterations of fat body cells by increasing carbohydrates in trophocytes, and reduction of oenocyte size, and increased the frequency of pericardial cells in the advanced activity stage. Both pesticides caused changes in HSP70 immunolabelling of midgut from males at the end of pesticide exposure. Comparatively, the effects on males were stronger than in females exposed to the same pesticides. Therefore, acetamiprid alone and in mixture with fungicide azoxystrobin can be harmful to males and females of Neotropical solitary bee C. analis showing lethal and sublethal effects at a concentration likely to be found in the environment. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124712,360.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201012084&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124712&partnerID=40&md5=473fb0290f046c3ad77add42df7197ea,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'Pesticide', 'survival', 'adult', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'midgut', 'Survival', 'antibody labeling', 'Fat body', 'fungicide', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'histopathology', 'Pyrimidines', 'fat pad', 'chemical pollutant', 'Azoxystrobin', 'RNA interference', '% reductions', 'sex difference', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'fertility', 'aubergine', 'cell adhesion', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP', 'gender', 'Hsp70', 'Limited information', 'Malpighiales', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid']",,,,,0,196,0,
363,643,JOUR,Food consumption and food exchange of caged honey bees using a radioactive labelled sugar solution,"['Brodschneider, R.', 'Libor, A.', 'Kupelwieser, V.', 'Crailsheim, K.']",PLoS ONE,"We measured the distribution of sugar solution within groups of caged honey bees (Apis mellifera) under standard in vitro laboratory conditions using 14C polyethylene glycol as a radioactive marker to analyze ingestion by individual bees after group feeding. We studied the impact of different experimental setups by varying the number of bees, age of bees, origin of bees, duration of experiment, the amount of available diet, and the influence of the neurotoxic pesticide imidacloprid in the diet on the feeding and food sharing behavior (trophallaxis). Sugar solution was non-uniformly distributed in bees in 36 out of 135 cages. As a measure of the extent to which the sugar diet was equally distributed between caged bees, we calculated the (inner 80%) intake ratio by dividing the intake of the 90th percentile bee by the intake of the 10th percentile bee. This intake ratio ranged from 1.3 to 94.8 in 133 individual cages, further supporting a non-uniform distribution of food among caged bees. We can expect a cage with 10 or 30 bees containing one bee that ingests, on average, the 8.8-fold of the bee in the same cage ingesting the smallest quantity of food. Inner 80% intake ratios were lower in experiments with a permanent or chronic offering of labelled sugar solution compared to temporary or acute feedings. After pooling the data of replicates to achieve a higher statistical power we compared different experimental setups. We found that uniform food distribution is best approached with 10 newly emerged bees per cage, which originate from a brood comb from a single colony. We also investigated the trophallaxis between caged honey bees which originally consumed the diet and newly added bees. Color marked bees were starved and added to the cages in a ratio of 10:5 or 20:20 after the initial set of bees consumed all the labelled sugar solution. The distribution of the labelled sugar solution by trophallaxis within 48 hours to added bees was 25% (10:5) or 45% (20:20) of the initial sugar solution. Imidacloprid at its median lethal dose (LD50) in the sugar solution reduced this post-feeding food transmission to 27% (20:20). Our results show that differences in food intake exist within caged bees that may lead to differential exposure that can influence the interpretation of toxicity tests. ¬© 2017 Brodschneider et al.

358,638,JOUR,Effects of Sublethal Doses of Imidacloprid on Young Adult Honeybee Behaviour,"['Go√±alons, C', 'Farina, WM']",PLOS ONE,"Imidacloprid (IMI), a neonicotinoid used for its high selective toxicity to insects, is one of the most commonly used pesticides. However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015/10/21/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10.0,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000363248400070,,,0,198,0,

Among these insecticides, thiacloprid, a commonly used compound with low toxicity, has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on the olfactory and learning abilities of honeybees. The effect of sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid on the antennal activity of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, laboratory-based experiments were conducted in which honeybee larvae were administered thiacloprid (0.5¬†mg/L and 1.0¬†mg/L). Using electroantennography (EAG), the impacts of thiacloprid exposure on the antennal selectivity to common floral volatiles were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of sub-lethal exposure on odor-related learning and memory were also assessed. The results of this study reveal, for the first time, that sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid decreased honeybee antenna EAG responses to floral scents, leading to increased olfactory selectivity in the high-dose (1.0¬†mg/L) group compared to the control group (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.042). The results also suggest that thiacloprid negatively affected odor-associated paired learning acquisition, as well as medium-term (1¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.019) and long-term memory (24¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.037) in adult honeybees. EAG amplitudes were dramatically reduced following R-linalool paired olfactory training (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.001; 0¬†mg/L vs. 0.5¬†mg/L: p = 0.027), while antennal activities only differed significantly in the control between paired and unpaired groups. Our results indicated that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid may affect olfactory perception and learning and memory behaviors in honeybees. These findings have important implications for the safe use of agrochemicals in the environment.

Realistic experiments showed that neonicotinoids increased worker mortality and were associated with declines in social immunity and increased queenlessness over time.

ML has significant potential in risk assessments of non-target insects for modeling the multiple factors affecting insect health, including the adverse effects of agrochemicals. Here, the potential of ML for risk assessments of glyphosate (herbicide; formulation) and imidacloprid (insecticide, neonicotinoid; formulation) on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata was explored. The collective behavior of forager bees was analyzed after in vitro exposure to agrochemicals. ML algorithms were applied to identify the agrochemicals that the bees have been exposed to based on multivariate behavioral features. Changes in the in situ detection of different proteins in the midgut were also studied. Imidacloprid exposure leads to the greatest changes in behavior. The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology. This study provides a holistic assessment of the sublethal effects of glyphosate and imidacloprid on a key pollinator. The procedures used here can be applied in future studies to monitor and predict multiple environmental factors affecting insect health in the field. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127344,424.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116067761&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2021.127344&partnerID=40&md5=fd911a3889af1c41ff84a846124857ce,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'nonhuman', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'forager', 'Hexapoda', 'physiology', 'Imidacloprids', 'Eco-toxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Melipona quadrifasciata', 'Meliponinae', 'stingless bee', 'toxicology', 'environmental factor', 'Health risks', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'agrochemical', 'Pollinators', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'algorithm', 'animal tissue', 'artificial intelligence', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'behavior', 'cell protein', 'contamination', 'data accuracy', 'feature selection', 'hyperparameter optimization', 'immunofluorescence', 'in vitro study', 'machine learning', 'Machine learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Machine learning algorithms', 'Mass Gatherings', 'midgut', 'Multiple factors', 'multivariate analysis', 'Multivariate data', 'Physiological models', 'Physiological response', 'Physiology', 'Pollinator', 'protein analysis', 'Proteins', 'recursive feature elimination', 'Target insect', 'Toxicological assessment', 'Varanidae']",,,,,0,203,0,

Several causes such as land-use change and agricultural intensification are reported to be the main drivers of the decline. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of land use on honey bee and stingless bee populations. Research was conducted in Bogor and Malang to compare between two different geographical areas. Managed bees such as honey bees (Apis cerana and A. mellifera) and stingless bees (Tetragonula laeviceps) were investigated to examine the effect of agricultural intensification. Field experiments were conducted by placing beehives in selected habitats (i.e., beekeeper gardens, forests areas, and agriculture areas). Population growth and neonicotinoid residue analysis of bees in different hive locations were measured to study the effect of habitat type. Population growth of bees represents the forager abundance and colony weight. Based on the analysis, we found that habitat type affected forager abundance and colony weight of honey bees (p < 0.05), although the patterns were different between species, region, as well as season. Forests could support the stingless bee colony better than agriculture and home garden habitats.

Because the presence of sublethal doses or concentrations may also alter the behavior of foraging insects, we attempted to devise a quantifiable and accurate protocol for evidencing various alterations in free-flying bees. Such a protocol was illustrated by testing new classes of systemic insecticides. The protocol focused on video recording to quantify the foraging activity of small colonies of honey bees confined in insect-proof tunnels. The basis of the protocol was not the colony itself but the change in each colony on a specific day and between days. First, the paradigms of attendance at a safe feeding source were established by observing 8 control colonies at different times of the season during 5 days after the necessary forager training was accomplished. Second, on three different colonies we considered the paradigms on the control day before contamination and during 4 days after the feeding source was contaminated. During the same period, one more colony was exclusively fed with safe food to serve as control. Two plant-systemic insecticides were tested at contamination levels 70 times lower than the 50% of the lethal concentration. Imidacloprid, at 6 mug/kg, clearly induced a decrease in the proportion of active bees. Fipronil, at 2 mug/kg, induced an additional decrease in attendance at the feeder. Such levels are still higher than the corresponding lowest observable effect concentration (LOEC).

In contrast to applications of single PPPs the effects of tank mixtures are not routinely evaluated in the risk assessment process of PPPs with the exception of known synergistic insecticides and mixing partners. Due to economi-cal constraints and process efficiency PPP mixtures are commonly used in agricultural practices. However, some-times interactions among agrochemicals lead to undesir-able additive and synergistic effects. Especially mixtures of pyrethroids or neonicotinoids with azole fungicides, which inhibit sterol biosynthesis, have a synergistic potential of negatively affecting honey bees. For such mixtures, regulatory restrictions are already in place. These synergistic effects are associated with azole fungicides inhibiting the main detoxification enzyme P450, which hinders the bee to detoxify the insecticide. Further studies provide first evidence for increased impacts of mixtures of insecticides with adjuvants on honey bees. More research is necessary to better understand mixture toxicity and to implement this knowledge in the risk assessment. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.",2020///,2020,10.5073/JfK.2020.05.05,72.0,5,154,161,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084201388&doi=10.5073%2fJfK.2020.05.05&partnerID=40&md5=1f3c674c0b47889636e0e7b64efcb845,Scopus,,,,Auswirkungen von pflanzenschutzmittel-tankmischungen auf honigbienen und m√∂gliche physiologische interaktionen,,0,207,0,

We aimed to determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g, respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid.

281,561,JOUR,Quantifying exposure of wild bumblebees to mixtures of agrochemicals in agricultural and urban landscapes,"['Bot√≠as, C', 'David, A', 'Hill, EM', 'Goulson, D']",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,"The increased use of pesticides has caused concern over the possible direct association of exposure to combinations of these compounds with bee health problems. There is growing proof that bees are regularly exposed to mixtures of agrochemicals, but most research has been focused on managed bees living in farmland, whereas little is known about exposure of wild bees, both in farmland and urban habitats. To determine exposure of wild bumblebees to pesticides in agricultural and urban environments through the season, specimens of five different species were collected from farms and ornamental urban gardens in three sampling periods. Five neonicotinoid insecticides, thirteen fungicides and a pesticide synergist were analysed in each of the specimens collected. In total, 61% of the 150 individuals tested had detectable levels of at least one of the compounds, with boscalid being the most frequently detected (35%), followed by tebuconazole (27%), spiroxamine (19%), carbendazim (11%), epoxiconazole (8%), imidacloprid (7%), metconazole (7%) and thiamethoxam (6%). Quantifiable concentrations ranged from 0.17 to 54.4 ng/g (bee body weight) for individual pesticides. From all the bees where pesticides were detected, the majority (71%) had more than one compound, with a maximum of seven pesticides detected in one specimen. Concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in bees collected from farmland compared to urban sites, and pesticide concentrations decreased through the season. Overall, our results show that wild bumblebees are exposed to multiple pesticides when foraging in agricultural and urban landscapes. Such mixtures are detected in bee tissues not just during the crop flowering period, but also later in the season. Therefore, contact with these combinations of active compounds might be more prolonged in time and widespread in the environment than previously assumed. These findings may help to direct future research and pesticide regulation strategies to promote the conservation of wild bee populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

140,420,JOUR,Sugar content of diet does not buffer against chronic oral imidacloprid exposure in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),"['Cecala, J.M.', 'Baronia, D.A.', 'Wilson Rankin, E.E.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"Bees are economically critical pollinators, but are declining broadly due to several stressors, including nontarget exposure to insecticides and deficiencies in nutrition. Understanding the simultaneous impact of stressors, particularly interactions between them, is critical to effectively conserving bees. Although behavioral effects of pesticides like neonicotinoids have received some attention in solitary bees, our understanding of how they are modulated by diet quality is limited. Furthermore, scarce data exist on what concentrations of orally ingested neonicotinoids elicit mortality in solitary bees. In a controlled exposure laboratory experiment, we investigated how diet quality, as sugar concentration, and chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid affect adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius). We provided individuals ad libitum with either 20 or 50% (m/m) sucrose syrups containing either 0, 30, or 300 ppb imidacloprid (measuring 0, 27, and 209 ppb via an ELISA assay). Over 5 wk, we tracked behavior and survivorship of individuals. Imidacloprid decreased survivorship in a dose-dependent fashion, but sucrose content did not affect survivorship, even in bees not fed imidacloprid. In the high imidacloprid treatment, 45% of bees were observed in a motionless supine position while still alive, with this effect appearing to be buffered against by the higher sucrose diet. Our results suggest that diets higher in sugar concentration may prevent an intermediate stage of poisoning, but do not ultimately extend longevity. In devising risk assessments for bees, it is important to consider that interactions between stressors may occur in the stages leading up to death even if survivorship is unaffected. ¬© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

They play a significant role as pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops and produce economical products, such as honey, royal jelly, wax, pollen, propolis, and venom. Despite their ecological and economical importance, the global honey bee population is in decline due to factors including pathogens, parasites, intensive agriculture, and pesticides. Moreover, these factors may be interlinked and exacerbate the loss of honey bees. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between a pesticide, thiamethoxam, and deformed wing virus type A (DWV-A) to honey bees and the effects on survival rate, wing characteristics, and expression of immune and apoptosis genes in Apis mellifera. We described the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A on honey bee wing characteristics, DWV-A loads, and the expressions of immune (defensin, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin) and apoptosis genes (buffy, apaf1, caspase3-like, caspase8-like, and caspase9-like). Honey bee larvae were fed with three different thiamethoxam doses (0.001, 1.4, and 14.3 ng/¬µL of the diet). Then, thiamethoxam-treated white-eyed pupae were injected with 107 copy numbers/honey bee of the DWV-A genome. The interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A caused a high mortality rate, crippled wings in newly emerged adult honey bees (100%), and resulted in induced expression of hymenoptaecin gene compared to the control group, while downregulation of caspase8-like, caspase9-like genes compared to the DWV injection group. Therefore, the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A might have a deleterious effect on honey bee lifespan. The results from this study could be used as a tool to combat DWV-A infection and mitigate pesticide usage to alleviate the decrease in the honey bee population. ¬© 2022 by the authors.

Despite males being exposed to higher dosages of thiamethoxam, females revealed an overall increased hazard rate for survival; suggesting sex-specific differences in toxicological sensitivity. All tested sublethal concentrations (i.e., 1.5, 4.5 and 10 ng g‚àí1) reduced sperm quantity by 57% and viability by 42% on average, with the lowest tested concentration leading to a reduction in total living sperm by 90%. As the tested sublethal concentrations match estimates of global neonicotinoid pollution, this reveals a plausible mechanism for population declines, thereby reflecting a realistic concern. An immediate reduction in environmental pollutants is required to decelerate the ongoing loss of biodiversity. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117106,284.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105894810&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2021.117106&partnerID=40&md5=9f60e52fb229819e16f3d0c09d8c8f0b,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'sublethal effect', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'Hexapoda', 'survival analysis', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'adult', 'thiamethoxam', 'sperm', 'Thiamethoxam', 'male', 'sublethal concentration', 'Male', 'food intake', 'Food supply', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Female', 'Osmia', 'Exposed to', 'biodiversity', 'Biodiversity', 'chemical pollutant', 'pollution', 'Osmia cornuta', 'Fertility', '% reductions', 'sex difference', 'Pollution', 'Solitary bee', 'Environmental pollutants', 'fertility', 'toxicological parameters', 'sperm function', 'Food security', 'sperm count', 'Ecosystem functioning', 'laboratory technique', 'Male fertility', 'male infertility', 'Sperm trait', 'Sperm traits', 'sperm viability']",,,,,0,216,0,

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the possible effects of the exposure of A. mellifera larvae to a field concentration of thiamethoxam (0.001 ng/ŒºL thiamethoxam) on larval and pupal survival and on the percentage of adult emergence. Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence. However, this exposure caused ultra-structural alterations in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees. The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria. These alterations indicate possible tissue degeneration, demonstrating the cytotoxicity of thiamethoxam in the target and non-target organs of newly emerged bees.

When applied as seed treatment, residues of the tested molecules in the pollen and nectar samples were present below quantifiable levels (< LOQ). At 3 days after spraying, residues of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam were 0.86 and 0.96 mg/kg in the leaf samples, 0.15 and 0.23 mg/kg in the pollen samples, and 0.07 and 0.07 mg/kg in the nectar samples, respectively. Further, the foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment. Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application. Nonetheless, the foraging activity was comparable to the control levels 7 days after spraying.

It is increasingly recognized, that some neonicotinoid insecticides have a negative impact on non-target organisms, including important pollinators such as the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honeybee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee viability are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide carbendazim and the herbicide glyphosate. We also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honeybee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: (i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), (ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, which are important for neuronal function. Our results showed that acute thiamethoxam exposure is not enhanced by carbendazim, nor glyphosate.

Molecular mass profiling by MALDI BeeTyping((R)) was used on bee haemolymph to explore the signature of pesticidal and parasitic stressor impacts. This approach was complemented by bottom-up proteomics to investigate the modulation of the haemoproteome. We tested acute oral doses of three pesticides-glyphosate, Amistar and sulfoxaflor-on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, alongside the gut parasite Crithidia bombi. We found no impact of any pesticide on parasite intensity and no impact of sulfoxaflor or glyphosate on survival or weight change. Amistar caused weight loss and 19-41% mortality. Haemoproteome analysis showed various protein dysregulations. The major pathways dysregulated were those involved in insect defences and immune responses, with Amistar having the strongest impact on these dysregulated pathways.

We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5 ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g). Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or beebread (all P > 0.05).

However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.013,378.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067047889&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.06.013&partnerID=40&md5=f68712a866c4f5d0606542d373257fce,Scopus,,,,,,0,227,0,

Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./ŒºL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR.

Imidacloprid is a chloronicotinyl insecticide, which has a highly specific affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the honeybee's nervous system. So it may interfere with dance behavior and memory formation. We found the waggle dances were modulated in honeybees fed sucrose water containing imidacloprid (pesticide group) compared to those fed normal sucrose water (control group). In our data, dancers of the pesticide group significantly increased the variance of divergence angle and the return phases in waggle dances than the control group. And the dance followers in pesticide group significantly increased the variance of crop content than the control group. Furthermore, four learning and memory related genes were significantly regulated at the gene expression levels between pesticide and control group. Our data revealed that the sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid impaired the honeybees‚Äô learning and memory and resulted in cognitive disorder. The dancers may adjust their recruitment behavior leading to the observed reduced number of followers.

The samples of winter stores of bee bread and sugar food (honey or syrup processed by bees), beeswax and bees collected from apiaries with low and high rates of winter colony mortality were searched for acaricides used to control V. destructor and plant protection pesticides. The presence of acaricides used in apiculture has been detected in the 51% beeswax samples. The most abundant acaricide was tau-fluvalinate. The stores of bee bread and sugar food had a similar frequency of plant protection pesticide occurrence, ranging between 50‚Äì60%, but the number of active substances and their concentrations were substantially lower in sugar food samples. The most prevalent pesticides in pollen were fungicides (carbendazim and boscalid) and insecticides (acetamiprid and thiacloprid). Only a few pesticides were found in the several dead honey bees. The level of pesticide contamination (frequency, concentration, toxicity) of hive products and bees originating from apiaries with both a high and low winter colony survival rates, was similar, which created a similar extent of risk.

168,448,JOUR,Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor,"['Shi, T.', 'Meng, L.', 'Jiang, X.', 'Cao, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 Œºg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105168,186.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133685313&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2022.105168&partnerID=40&md5=b1ef6e8626b7374409ce791d5d5e90fb,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'metabolism', 'brain', 'genetics', 'insect protein', 'Apis mellifera L.', 'Brain', 'Insect Proteins', 'proteome', 'Proteome', 'Global proteome', 'Metabolism pathways', 'Molecular effects']",,,,,0,232,0,

Due to its good systemicity and low toxicity to humans and animals, it has been widely used in agricultural production. Thus there is still a low residue in plants, and this sublethal dose residue can still cause adverse effects on the behavior and nervous system of flower-visiting insects like bees.„ÄêObjective„ÄëThe objective of this study is to clarify the effect of sublethal dose imidacloprid (a kind of neonicotinoid insecticides) on the nervous physiological and metabolism system of Apis cerana cerana„Äê. Method„ÄëIn this study, the worker bees were treated with two sublethal concentration gradient doses of 5 and 10 Œºg‚Ä¢L-1 imidacloprid for 10 days (three biological replicates). After total RNA was extracted, the resulting library was analyzed by RNA-seq. Throughput sequencing, and the bioinformatics technology was used to assemble and annotate the sequence de novo, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after sublethal doses imidacloprid treatment were analyzed by clustering and enrichment. Finally, real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) technology was used to verify the DEGs related to the nervous and metabolic systems.„ÄêResult„ÄëA total of 9 sequencing libraries were obtained, the ratio of effective sequencing data exceeded 94.45%. From the obtained 37 364 unigenes, 571 DEGs were identified. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG found that the DEGs were mainly related to multiple pathways such as protein translation, redox, oxidative phosphorylation, and ribosome, indicating that sublethal doses of imidacloprid had an impact on multiple physiological processes and metabolic pathways of A. c. cerana. Nine DEGs (e.g. neuropeptide F (NPF), neuropeptide SIFamide receptor (SIFaR), phosphoinositide 3-dependent kinases (PDK1), A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA3), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 alpha subcomplex subunit 10 (ND42), cuticle protein 12 (CP12), and odorant-binding protein (OBP17)) related to nerve signal transmission and metabolic function were selected for RT-qPCR verification. Their expression patterns were completely consistent with the transcriptome results. „ÄêConclusion„ÄëThe sublethal dose of imidacloprid can affect lots of aspects of A. c. cerana such as nerve signal transduction, cellular respiration, immune response, maintenance of homeostasis, and olfactory perception. ¬© 2022 Editorial Department of Scientia Agricultura Sinica.

A novel butenolide pesticide, flupyradifurone, was recently introduced to the US and shown to have a bee-friendly toxicity profile. Like the much-scrutinized neonicotinoids that preceded it, flupyradifurone targets the insect nervous system. Some neonicotinoids have been shown to interfere with antiviral immunity, which raised the concern that similar effects may be observed with flupyradifurone. In this study, we investigated how flupyradifurone and a neonicotinoid, clothianidin, affect the ability of honey bee workers to combat an infection of Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). We exposed workers to field-realistic doses of the pesticides either with or without co-exposure with the virus, and then tracked survival and changes in viral titers. We repeated the experiment in the spring and fall to look for any seasonal effects. We found that flupyradifurone caused elevated mortality in the fall, but it did not lead to increased virus-induced mortality. Flupyradifurone also appeared to affect virus clearance, as bees co-exposed to the pesticide and virus tended to have higher viral titers after 48 hours than those exposed to the virus alone. Clothianidin had no effect on viral titers, and it actually appeared to increase resistance to viral infection in spring bees.

Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees'mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees. ¬© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

This study measured memory with the proboscis extension response (PER) assay as well as the expression of neural genes in bees chronically exposed to three different sublethal doses of the insecticide clothianidin and/or the parasitic mite Varroa destructor. The proportion of bees that positively responded to PER at 24 and 48 h post-training (hpt) was significantly reduced when exposed to clothianidin. V. destructor parasitism reduced the proportion of bees that responded to PER at 48 hpt. Combined effects between the lowest clothianidin dose and V. destructor for the proportion of bees that responded to PER were found at 24 hpt. Clothianidin, V. destructor and their combination differentially affected the expression of the neural-related genes, AmNrx-1 (neurexin), AmNlg-1 (neuroligin), and AmAChE-2 (acetylcholinesterase). Different doses of clothianidin down-regulated or up-regulated the genes, whereas V. destructor tended to have a down-regulatory effect.

This study aimed to isolate, identify, and investigate the potential of honeybee gut bacterial strains in mitigating the detrimental effects of insecticides on honeybees and extending their lifespan. The efficacy of seven honeybee gut bacterial strains in reducing insecticide toxicity was evaluated. Through the identification of honeybee gut bacterial isolates using 16s rRNA, seven strains were identified, namely Priestia endophytica, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Peribacillus frigoritolerans, B. subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus tequilensis. The experimental results revealed that bees treated with these gut bacteria significantly reduced oxidative stress markers and detoxification enzyme levels compared to untreated bees. Moreover, the treated bees demonstrated enhanced immune responses. The bees treated with deltamethrin + intestinal bacteria showed an increase in bees‚Äô lifespan to 6.33 days compared to a lifespan of 4 days with deltamethrin only. Similarly, bees treated with acetamiprid intestinal bacteria had further extended to 10.33 days compared to a lifespan of 7.67 days with acetamiprid. These findings suggest that using honeybee gut bacterial strains may serve as a sustainable strategy to mitigate the harmful impacts of insecticides on honeybees, thereby promoting their overall health and contributing to the preservation of pollination services and apiculture.

Here we evaluate the effects of realistic exposure via squash crops treated with systemic insecticides (Admire-imidacloprid soil application, FarMore FI400-thiamethoxam seed-coating, or Coragen-chlorantraniliprole foliar spray) for a ground-nesting bee species (Hoary squash bee,¬†Eucera pruinosa) in a 3-year semi-field experiment. Hoary squash bees provide essential pollination services to pumpkin and squash crops and commonly nest within cropping areas increasing their risk of pesticide exposure from soil, nectar, and pollen. When exposed to a crop treated at planting with soil-applied imidacloprid, these bees initiated 85% fewer nests, left 5.3 times more pollen unharvested, and produced 89% fewer offspring than untreated controls. No measurable impacts on bees from exposure to squash treated with thiamethoxam as a seed-coating or foliage sprayed with chlorantraniliprole were found. Our results demonstrate important sublethal effects of field-realistic exposure to a soil-applied neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bee behaviour and reproductive success.

In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed ‚Äúcarryover‚Äù effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. ¬© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

Tackling this challenge is, however, necessary to establish their negative side effects on these pollinators. For instance, it is still under debate the mechanism by which bees seem to recognize low-level contaminations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar and pollen of the flowers they visit and limit collection to protect themselves and their hive from a possible intoxication. In this study, we propose an experimental system that involves the use of foragers in free flight foraging repeatedly on artificial feeders containing a sucrose solution contaminated with clothianidin, as well as foragers feeding at adjacent control feeders, allowing us to observe changes in their foraging activity. The progressive disappearance of foragers from the contaminated feeders became increasingly clear and rapid with the increase in clothianidin concentration. The lowest concentration at which we observed an effect was around 10 mu g/L, which corresponds to the maximum residual concentration (10 ng/g) observed in pollen and nectar of flowers close to open fields sown with seeds coated with insecticides. At the highest concentrations tested (80 mu g/L), there was an almost total abandonment of the feeders. The estimated quantity of contaminated sucrose solution collected by foragers showed an almost linear relationship inversely proportional to clothianidin concentration, whilst the estimated quantity of insecticide collected by a forager increased and then stabilised at the highest concentrations tested of 40 and 80 mu g/L. Irregular mortality was not observed in front of the hives, furthermore, foragers did not show evident memory of the position of the treated units in the trials on the 2 consecutive days. The decrease in foraging activity in the presence of a few mu g/L of insecticide in the sucrose solution appears to limit the introduction of elevated amounts of toxic substances into the hives, which would have serious consequences for the young bees and the brood.

Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid.

However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees.

However, little is known about how this agonist affects two specific aspects of foraging: sucrose responsiveness (SR) and waggle dancing (which recruits nestmates). Using lab and field experiments, we tested the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on (1) bee SR with the proboscis extension response assay, and (2) free-flying foragers visiting and dancing for a sucrose feeder. Bees that ingested imidacloprid (0.21 or 2.16 ng bee -1) had higher sucrose response thresholds 1 h after treatment. Foragers that ingested imidacloprid also produced significantly fewer waggle dance circuits (10.5- and 4.5-fold fewer for 50% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively) 24 h after treatment as compared with controls. However, there was no significant effect of imidacloprid on the sucrose concentrations that foragers collected at a feeder 24 h after treatment. Thus, imidacloprid temporarily increased the minimum sucrose concentration that foragers would accept (short time scale, 1 h after treatment) and reduced waggle dancing (longer time scale, 24 h after treatment). The effect of time suggests different neurological effects of imidacloprid resulting from the parent compound and its metabolites. Waggle dancing can significantly increase colony food intake, and thus a sublethal dose (0.21 ng bee -1, 24 p.p.b.) of this commonly used pesticide may impair colony fitness. ¬© 2012 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",2012///,2012,10.1242/jeb.068718,215.0,12,2022,2029,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862509996&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.068718&partnerID=40&md5=a49fa590d0ca066e31d284c615c955e3,Scopus,,,,,,0,253,0,

The intensity of HSP70 immunolabeling increased compared to the control groups. However, the intensity of the immunolabeling of HSP90 decreased in the IMD, GLY, and I + G (IMD + GLY) groups but increased in I +P -exposed bees (IMD + PYR). Alternatively, exposure to PYR and P + G (PYR + GLY) did not affect the immunolabeling intensity.

One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria.

Considering the ecological and economic relevance of native bees, such as Scaptotrigona postica, and the insufficient studies on the effects of pesticides on their behavior and physiology, improving the current knowledge on this issue is essential. Therefore, this study investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, and glyphosate on the behavior and fat body cells of S. postica. Pesticide ingestion decreased the walking distance and mean velocity of bees compared to the control and solvent control groups. The oenocytes of the control groups were spherical, with central nuclei containing decondensed chromatin, and the trophocytes presented irregular morphology, with cells varying in shape and the cytoplasm filled with vacuoles and granules. However, bees exposed to pesticides showed extensive cytoarchitectural disruption in the fat body, such as vacuolization and shape changes in oenocytes and altered nuclei morphology in trophocytes. Moreover, pesticide exposure increased the number of atypical oenocytes and altered trophocytes, except for the PYR group, which showed a lower number of atypical oenocytes. Caspase-positive labeling significantly increased in all exposed bee groups. Alternatively, TLR4 labeling was significantly decreased in the exposed groups compared to the control groups. There was a significant increase in HSP90 immunolabeling in all exposed groups compared to the control. These findings reinforce the importance of research on the sublethal effects of low pesticide concentrations on key neotropical pollinators and prove that these toxic substances can impair their detoxification and immune defense. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168072,907.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85175094565&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.168072&partnerID=40&md5=0e49e41638f2caecbc9cbb9bf47c7524,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Sublethal effects', 'velocity', 'Imidacloprids', 'Eco-toxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Neotropics', 'stingless bee', 'sublethal concentration', 'glyphosate', 'Herbicides', 'animal cell', 'apoptosis', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell death', 'unclassified drug', 'Glyphosates', 'Pollinators', 'Pollinator', 'Ecology', 'antibody labeling', 'body fat', 'cell', 'Control groups', 'Fat Body', 'fungicide', 'heat shock protein 90', 'Morphology', 'pyrachlostrobin', 'pyraclostrobin', 'toll like receptor 4', 'trophocyte', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'Atypicals', 'caspase', 'cell granule', 'cell structure', 'cell vacuole', 'cells by function', 'chromatin', 'cytoplasm', 'fat', 'Fat body cells', 'fat pad', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'Labelings', 'oenocyte', 'Pesticide use', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'solvent', 'walking distance']",,,,,0,258,0,

Although laboratory trials report deleterious effects in honeybees at trace levels, field surveys reveal no decrease in the performance of honeybee colonies in the vicinity of treated fields. Here we provide the missing link, showing that individual honeybees near thiamethoxam-treated fields do indeed disappear at a faster rate, but the impact of this is buffered by the colonies‚Äô demographic regulation response. Although we could ascertain the exposure pathway of thiamethoxam residues from treated flowers to honeybee dietary nectar, we uncovered an unexpected pervasive co-occurrence of similar concentrations of imidacloprid, another neonicotinoid normally restricted to non-entomophilous crops in the study country. Thus, its origin and transfer pathways through the succession of annual crops need be elucidated to conveniently appraise the risks of combined neonicotinoid exposures.

Mortality was tested in another experiment using exposure at the same concentrations with two differing soil moisture levels (20% and 40%). Nesting activity was reduced by 42% for females exposed at 390 ppb and by 66% for females exposed at 780 ppb. Females treated at 780 ppb produced 40% fewer nest cells per day. Sex ratios of F1 generation were skewed toward male in the 50 ppb treatment group with 50% fewer females. The number of cells and pre-pupae per nest, as well as the weight of pre-pupal cocoons did not vary among exposure levels. There were no mortality effects at 20% soil moisture for any level of imidacloprid, but at 40%, mortality of females was >50% at all levels of imidacloprid.

A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism.

However, in cultivated areas, they can be exposed to the chemicals utilized for crop protection. Neonicotinoid insecticides can adversely affect honey bee colonies impairing their survival, immunity and biological activities at lethal and sublethal doses. For this reason, neonicotinoids, together with other stress factors, like pathogens (e.g. viruses and Varroa mites), climate change and food shortage, are considered one of the causes of worldwide colony losses. Nevertheless, the natural way of entry and diffusion of these pesticides in field colonies is not completely clear. Here, we wanted to fill this gap by studying the diffusion route of imidacloprid and its metabolites by analysing different matrices collected from honey bee colonies used for pollination of apple orchards, in the framework of applied Integrated Pest Management strategies. Pollen, honey bees, honey, royal jelly, bee wax and bee bread were sampled from 6 honey bee colonies placed in two different apple orchards before blooming, exposed to chemicals application and removed from the site after that. Samples were analysed using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) in order to detect imidacloprid, olefin im-idacloprid and 5-hydroxy imidacloprid. The results demonstrate that the primary way of entrance of imidacloprid was the pollen transported by foragers, while the main accumulation matrices were bee bread, honey and wax. These findings allow us to hypoth-esize that the accumulation of this insecticide, especially in bee bread, the main larval food, could potentially impact negatively on honey bee wellbeing at the adult stage.

We assessed the impacts of acetamiprid to the North American bumble bee Bombus impatiens using the microcolony model. We examined nest growth, development, and subsequent nest productivity as measured by drone production. We found that high concentrations of acetamiprid in pollen (4520 ¬µg/kg) significantly impacted nest growth, development, and, ultimately, reproduction (drone production). We found the no-observable‚Äìadverse effect level to be 45.2 ¬µg/kg. Overall, acetamiprid has the potential to negatively impact reproductive endpoints for B. impatiens.

Laboratory and semi-field studies have demonstrated lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on limited genera (e.g., Apis, Bombus, Megachile), yet full field studies evaluating impacts to wild bee communities remain limited. Here, we conducted a two-year field study to assess whether neonicotinoid seed treatment and presence in environmental media (e.g., soil, flowers) influenced bee nest and diet guild abundance and richness. In 2017 and 2018, we planted 23 Missouri agricultural fields to soybeans (Glycine max) using one of three seed treatments: untreated (no insecticide), treated (imidacloprid), or previously-treated (untreated, but neonicotinoid use prior to 2017). During both years, wild bees were collected in study field margins monthly (May to September) in tandem with soil and flowers from fields and field margins that were analyzed for neonicotinoid residues. Insecticide presence in soils and flowers varied over the study with neonicotinoids infrequently detected in both years within margin flowers (0%), soybean flowers (<1%), margin soils (<8%), and field soils (~39%). Wild bee abundance and species richness were not significantly different among field treatments. In contrast, neonicotinoid presence in field soils was associated with significantly lower richness (ground- and aboveground-nesting, diet generalists) of wild bee guilds. Our findings support that soil remains an underexplored route of exposure and long-term persistence of neonicotinoids in field soils may lead to reduced diversity in regional bee communities. Future reduction or elimination of neonicotinoid seed treatment use on areas managed for wildlife may facilitate conservation goals to sustain viable, diverse wild bee populations. ¬© 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147299,786.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105282479&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.147299&partnerID=40&md5=d30b2e15046c896f8085308414251f63,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'Crops', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'plant seed', 'Pollination', 'flower', 'chemistry', 'priority journal', 'Seeds', 'long term exposure', 'Ecosystems', 'Pollinators', 'Pollinator', 'Field studies', 'agriculture', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'Agro-ecosystems', 'agroecosystem', 'Cultivation', 'seed', 'Soils', 'Forestry', 'Amino acids', 'Glycine max', 'Seed', 'Seed treatment', 'soybean', 'soil', 'Megachile', 'Missouri', 'Agroecosystems', 'species richness', 'Field margins', 'relative abundance', 'Abundance', 'Bee functional guild', 'Bee functional guilds', 'guild', 'Nitrogen fixation', 'Richness']",,,,,0,269,0,

Much of what is known about the non-target effects on bees comes from oral exposure in eusocial species. However, most bee species are solitary and nest below ground. For them, contaminated nesting resources may represent an important, yet understudied, route of exposure. We examined the effect of chronic contact exposure with realistic soil concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (0, 7.5, 15, or 100 ppb) during immature development on adult locomotion (movement speed and distance) and brain development of the solitary bees Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata. Adult locomotion and mushroom body morphology were characterized 2 (females) or 4 (males) and 14 (both sexes) days after emergence. Unlike the 0 and 7.5 ppb groups, female O. lignaria treated with 15 and 100 ppb did not move faster with age. If movement speed is associated with foraging or nest-building ability, this could result in a 25% reduction in nest provisioning efficiency over the first 14 days. Young male M. rotundata moved more quickly (7.5 and 100 ppb) and farther (100 ppb) when treated with imidacloprid, potentially increasing their ability to compete for more receptive female bees. We did not detect an effect of imidacloprid on the relative volumes of the neuropil and Kenyon cell subregions. We discuss how an environmentally persistent xenobiotic has the potential to alter population dynamics through changes in adult locomotion, even in the absence of a detectable effect on gross brain morphology. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131177,283.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108001289&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2021.131177&partnerID=40&md5=008549debd2fcf0831c30c7a7d8f4b72,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'foraging behavior', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Hexapoda', 'foraging', 'velocity', 'Imidacloprids', 'adult', 'locomotion', 'male', 'mushroom body', 'Male', 'Imidacloprid', 'long term exposure', 'Mushroom bodies', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'Female', 'nesting', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'population dynamics', 'Biochemistry', 'Movement', 'Basidiomycota', 'biological development', 'Soil', 'kenyon cell', 'neuropil', 'Megachile rotundata', 'soil', 'brain development', 'Chronic contact', 'competitive ability', 'Competitive ability', 'Movement speed', 'Mushroom body', 'Nesting resource', 'Nesting resources', 'Non-target effects', 'Solitary bee']",,,,,0,270,0,

Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application.

The THC was not altered with the insecticide exposure and/or bacterial infection. However, the DHC of the bees changed with the imidacloprid exposure and/or bacterial infection. The number of prohemocytes (stem cells) increased in bees exposed to imidacloprid, but it did not change after the bacterial infection. The number of plasmatocytes (phagocytic cells) increased in imidacloprid-exposed and uninfected bees and decreased in infected bees regardless of the exposure to imidacloprid. On the other hand, there was a reduction of granulocytes, the most active immune cells, after imidacloprid exposure and an increase of granulocytes after the infection. Previous studies have shown that the neonicotinoids exposure can impair the immune system of bees.

As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation. Transcriptional alterations occurred at environmental concentrations and provide an explanation for the molecular basis of observed adverse effects of neonicotinoids to bees.

Gut microbiota is associated with insect nutritional health, immunocompetence, and is essential for neutralizing the damage caused by pathogens and xenobiotics. Research on the effect of the bioinsecticides and fertilizers on the microbiota of bees remains neglected. In this study, we assessed the sublethal effect of both bioinsecticide spinosad and the fertilizer copper sulfate (CuSO4) on the behavior and gut microbiota in forager adults of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese), which is an important pollinator in the Neotropical region. Behavioral assays and gut microbiota profiles were assessed on bees orally exposed to estimated LC5 values for spinosad and CuSO4. The microbiota were characterized through 16S rRNA gene target sequencing. Acute and oral sublethal exposure to spinosad and CuSO4 did not affect the overall activity, flight take-off, and food consumption. However, CuSO4 decreased bee respiration rate and copper accumulated in exposed bees. Exposure to spinosad increased the proportional abundance of the genus Gilliamella, but CuSO4 did not alter the composition of the gut microbiota. In conclusion, sublethal exposure to CuSO4 induces changes in respiration, and spinosad changes the abundance of gut microorganisms of P. helleri. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates. ¬© 2020.

The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Experiments were performed under laboratory conditions on adult workers collected from hives in February (winter bees) and July (summer bees) and revealed season-dependent changes in the bacterial community composition. N. ceranae and a lethal fipronil treatment increased the relative abundance of both Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi in surviving winter honeybees. The parasite and a sublethal exposure to all insecticides decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. regardless of the season.

To pollinate and to sustain the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour. However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus, TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and, potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain outdoors. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15308-6,7.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85033712581&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-017-15308-6&partnerID=40&md5=3f5ad3c593852af728b730e1444a9003,Scopus,,,,,,0,278,0,

It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects.

The identification of the genes that respond to pesticide exposure based on their expression is essential for understanding the xenobiotic detoxification metabolism in honey bees. For the accurate determination of target gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR, the expression stability of reference genes should be validated in honey bees exposed to various pesticides. Therefore, in this study, to select the optimal reference genes, we analyzed the amplification efficiencies of five candidate reference genes (RPS5, RPS18, GAPDH, ARF1, and RAD1a) and their expression stability values using four programs (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) across samples of five body parts (head, thorax, gut, fat body, and carcass) from honey bees exposed to seven pesticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, flupyradifurone, fenitrothion, carbaryl, amitraz, and bifenthrin). Among these five candidate genes, a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 was suggested for target gene normalization. Subsequently, expression levels of six genes (AChE1, CYP9Q1, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, CAT, and SOD1) were normalized with a combination of RAD1a and RPS18 in the different body parts from honey bees exposed to pesticides. Among the six genes in the five body parts, the expression of SOD1 in the head, fat body, and carcass was significantly induced by six pesticides. In addition, among seven pesticides, flupyradifurone statistically induced expression levels of five genes in the fat body. ¬© 2022 Kim et al.

Seed treatment insecticides, including neonicotinoids and novel insecticides like sulfoxaflor, display detrimental effects on wild and managed bees, even when present at sublethal quantities. These effects include deficits in flight navigation and homing ability, and decreased survival of exposed worker bees. Neonicotinoid insecticides disrupt visual motion detection in the locust, resulting in impaired escape behaviors, but it had not previously been shown whether seed treatment insecticides disrupt wide-field motion detection in the honeybee. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to two commonly used insecticides, imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and sulfoxaflor, results in impaired optomotor behavior in the honeybee. This behavioral effect correlates with altered stress and detoxification gene expression in the brain. Exposure to sulfoxaflor led to sparse increases in neuronal apoptosis, localized primarily in the optic lobes, however there was no effect of imidacloprid. We propose that exposure to cholinergic insecticides disrupts the honeybee‚Äôs ability to accurately encode wide-field visual motion, resulting in impaired optomotor behaviors. These findings provide a novel explanation for previously described effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on navigation and link these effects to sulfoxaflor for which there is a gap in scientific knowledge.

The parameters followed were: adult bee activity (number of bee entering the hive and pollen carrying activity), adult bee population level, capped brood area, frequency of parasitic and other diseases, mortality, number of frames with brood after wintering and a global score of colonies after wintering. The only parameters linked to feeding with imidacloprid-supplemented saccharose syrup when compared with feeding with non-supplemented syrup were: a statistically non-significant higher activity index of adult bees, a significantly higher frequency of pollen carrying during the feeding period and a larger number of capped brood cells. When imidacloprid was no longer applied, activity and pollen carrying were re-established at a similar level for all groups. Repeated feeding with syrup supplemented with imidacloprid did not provoke any immediate or any delayed mortality before, during or following the next winter, whereas such severe effects are described by several French bee keepers as a consequence of imidacloprid use for seed dressing in neighbouring cultures. In any case, during the whole study, mortality was very low in all groups, with no difference between imidacloprid-fed and control colonies. Further research should now address several hypotheses: the troubles described by bee keepers have causes other than imidacloprid; if such troubles are really due to this insecticide, they may only be observed either when bees consume contaminated pollen, when no other sources of food are available, in the presence of synergic factors (that still need to be identified), with some particular races of bees or when colonies are not strong and healthy. ¬© 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005///,2005,10.1002/ps.957,61.0,2,111,125,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-12244262801&doi=10.1002%2fps.957&partnerID=40&md5=be7454ddad9097857bff1c5edfe9b218,Scopus,,,,,,0,282,0,

Previous studies have demonstrated that the neonicotinoid thiacloprid has adverse effects on foraging and memory behaviors. However, there is no direct evidence linking thiacloprid-induced neuronal cell damage in the brains of honeybees to learning and memory dysfunction. Adult honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) workers were chronically exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid. We discovered that thiacloprid negatively affected their survival, food consumption, and body weight. In addition, sucrose sensitivity and memory performance were impaired. We evaluated the apoptosis of honeybee brain cells using TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) and Caspase-3 assays, which revealed that thiacloprid increases the dose-dependent apoptosis of neurons in the mushroom bodies (MB) and antennal lobes (AL). We also determined the abnormal transcripts of multiple genes, including vitellogenin (Vg), immune system genes (apidaecin and catalase), and memory-associated genes (pka, creb, Nmdar1, Dop2, Oa1, Oa-2R, and Oa-3R). These results indicate that exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid cause abnormal expression of memory-related genes and apoptosis of brain cells in the AL and MB, which may contribute to the memory disorder induced by thiacloprid exposure. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163820,885.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156154224&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163820&partnerID=40&md5=0d54d625ba5cc173cbdc088f9fc39bb5,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory disorder', 'sucrose', 'survival', 'adult', 'worker (insect)', 'mushroom body', 'sublethal concentration', 'thiacloprid', 'Adverse effect', 'animal cell', 'antenna (organ)', 'antennal lobe', 'Antennal lobes', 'apidaecin gene', 'apoptosis', 'Apoptosis', 'biotin', 'body mass', 'body weight', 'brain cell', 'Brain cells', 'caspase 3', 'catalase', 'Cell death', 'creb gene', 'digoxigenin', 'DNA nucleotidylexotransferase', 'Dop2 gene', 'down regulation', 'enzyme assay', 'food consumption', 'food intake', 'Food supply', 'gene', 'Genes', 'Honeybee', 'Learning and memory', 'learning disorder', 'long term exposure', 'memory related gene', 'Mushroom bodies', 'neuroapoptosis', 'Neuronal apoptosis', 'Neurons', 'Nmdar1 gene', 'Oa 2R gene', 'Oa 3R gene', 'Oa1 gene', 'pka gene', 'pollution effect', 'polypeptide antibiotic agent', 'recall', 'Thiacloprid', 'TUNEL assay', 'unclassified drug', 'Vg gene', 'vitellogenin', ""Workers'""]",,,,,0,283,0,

However, its molecular effects are poorly known. Here, we report the global gene expression profile in the brain of honey bee foragers assessed by RNA-sequencing. Bees were exposed for 72 h to nominal concentrations of 25 and 250 ng/bee via sucrose solution. Determined residue concentrations by LC-MS/MS were 0.59 and 5.49 ng/bee, respectively. Thiacloprid exposure led to 5 and 71 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, as well as metabolism enzymes and transporters were altered at 5.49 ng/bee. Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that mitochondrial ribosome proteins, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, pyrimidine, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and additional metabolic pathways were altered. Among 21 genes assessed by RT-qPCR, the transcript of farnesol dehydrogenase involved in juvenile hormone III synthesis was significantly down-regulated. Transcripts of cyp6a14-like and apolipophorin-II like protein, cytochrome oxidase (cox17) and the non-coding RNA (LOC102654625) were significantly up-regulated at 5.49 ng/bee. Our findings indicate that thiacloprid causes transcriptional changes of genes prominently associated with mitochondria, particularly oxidative phosphorylation. This highlight potential effects of this neonicotinoid on energy metabolism, which may compromise bee foraging and thriving populations at environmentally relevant concentrations.

While multiple causal factors have been identified, seed coating with insecticides of the neonicotinoid family has been the focus of much discussion and research. Nonetheless, few studies have investigated the impacts of these insecticides under field conditions or in commercial beekeeping operations. Given that corn-seed coating constitutes the largest single use of neonicotinoid, our study compared honey bee mortality from commercial apiaries located in two different agricultural settings, i.e. corn-dominated areas and corn-free environments, during the corn planting season. Data was collected in 2012 and 2013 from 26 bee yards. Dead honey bees from five hives in each apiary were counted and collected, and samples were analyzed using a multi-residue LC-MS/MS method. Long-term effects on colony development were simulated based on a honey bee population dynamic model. Mortality survey showed that colonies located in a corn-dominated area had daily mortality counts 3.51 times those of colonies from corn crop-free sites. Chemical analyses revealed that honey bees were exposed to various agricultural pesticides during the corn planting season, but were primarily subjected to neonicotinoid compounds (54% of analysed samples contained clothianidin, and 31% contained both clothianidin and thiamethoxam). Performance development simulations performed on hive populations' show that increased mortality during the corn planting season sets back colony development and bears contributions to collapse risk but, most of all, reduces the effectiveness and value of colonies for pollination services. Our results also have implications for the numerous large-scale and worldwide-cultivated crops that currently rely on pre-emptive use of neonicotinoid seed treatments. ¬© 2017 Samson-Robert et al.",2017///,2017,10.7717/peerj.3670,2017.0,8,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027370657&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.3670&partnerID=40&md5=d0e9bf37441f530c8a45cca734d704db,Scopus,,,,,,0,285,0,

A strong immune defence is vital for the fitness of bees. However, the immune system can be weakened by environmental factors that may render bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid can severely affect the immunocompetence of Osmia bicornis. In detail, males exposed to thiacloprid solutions of 200 and 555 ¬µg/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence - the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph - were impaired in males. In females, however, only a concentration of 555 ¬µg/kg elicited similar immunosuppressive effects. Although males are smaller than females, they consumed more food solution. This leads to a 2.77 times higher exposure in males, probably explaining the different concentration thresholds observed between the sexes. In contrast to honeybees, dietary exposure to thiacloprid did not affect melanisation or wound healing in O. bicornis. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of O. bicornis, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-61445-w,10.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081579236&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-61445-w&partnerID=40&md5=27c64e7d725c3d59e59115314a2723b7,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'female', 'drug effect', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'male', 'thiacloprid', 'Male', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Female', 'hemolymph', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'immunology', 'blood cell', 'cell count', 'Cell Count', 'Hemocytes', 'Hemolymph', 'immunosuppressive agent', 'Immunosuppressive Agents']",,,,,0,286,0,

Sunflower seed are treated with 0.7 mg a.i./grain which is equivalent to 50 a.i./ha at a planting density of 70,000 plants/ha. In 3 tunnel and 8 field tests it was examined whether this seeddressing could have an influence on honeybees at the time of flowering. Residue analysis of flowers and honeybees were performed to determine the exposure of these pollinating insects during flowering. The residue levels were then compared with effect concentrations as determined in controlled feeding experiments. In none of the 3 tunnel and 8 field tests did the seeddressing with imidacloprid affect the vitality, the foraging activity or the behaviour of the honeybees. From these results it can be reliably concluded that a seeddressing of sunflower seed with imidacloprid has no biological relevance for honeybees. Pollen and nectar of sunflower plants were analysed for the presence of imidacloprid and its relevant metabolites. No quantifiable residue levels were found at a limit of quantitation of 10 ppb. In the controlled feeding experiments under field conditions, no adverse effects were observed on bees fed with spiked sugar solution up to 20 ppb imidacloprid. At higher concentrations (50-100 ppb) honeybees only reduced transitorily the foraging activity which indicates that honeybees realise the presence of imidacloprid at these levels. When these results are compared with the residue levels found in the relevant parts of the, sunflower plants it is evident that the findings of the tunnel and field tests are fully confirmed and that no adverse effects on honeybees must be expected from the use of Gauch (R) in sunflowers.",2001///,2001,,,,49,59,,,,0293-1915,WOS:000170386300001,,,0,287,0,

In the present study, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were exposed to a series of nitenpyram for 14 days. Results indicated that nitenpyram exposure decreased the survival and food consumption of honey bees. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that nitenpyram caused significant alterations in the relative abundance of several key gut microbiotas, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis and immunity.

The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline. ¬© 2022",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161331,868.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146540349&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.161331&partnerID=40&md5=a03515a9e14c5ba0807878b92627c4fd,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'nicotinic receptor', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'survival', 'Imidacloprids', 'sublethal dose', 'lifespan', 'Honey bee', 'gene expression', 'short term exposure', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'down regulation', 'long term exposure', 'unclassified drug', 'Weed control', 'protein expression', 'Sublethal dose', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'intestine flora', 'Non-target organism', 'bioaccumulation', 'glucose oxidase', 'Glucose', 'animal health', 'lysozyme', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'crop protection', 'nitrogen', 'Gut microbiota', 'Gut bacteria', 'Ammonia', 'ammonium', 'Glucose oxidase', 'Glucose sensors', 'glufosinate', 'Glufosinate', 'Glufosinate-ammonium', 'immunocompetence', 'Molecules', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'phosphinothricin']",,,,,0,290,0,

Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8‚Äì64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24¬†h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering.

287,567,JOUR,The effect of dietary neonicotinoid pesticides on non-flight thermogenesis in worker bumble bees (Bombus terrestris),"['Potts, R.', 'Clarke, R.M.', 'Oldfield, S.E.', 'Wood, L.K.', 'Hempel de Ibarra, N.', 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Journal of Insect Physiology,"For bumble bees (genus Bombus), the capacity for non-flight thermogenesis is essential for two fundamental processes undertaken by adult workers, namely recovery from torpor after chilling and brood incubation. Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose‚Äìresponse relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104.0,,33,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034786241&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2017.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=2ec6d258462a734f7451789afb4ab060,Scopus,,,,,,0,293,0,

Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides cause behavioural abnormalities and have proven that exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage decreases the olfactory learning ability of adults. The present study shows the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the neural development of the honey bee brain by immunolabelling synaptic units in the calyces of mushroom bodies. We found that the density of the synaptic units in the region of the calyces, which are responsible for olfactory and visual functions, decreased after being exposed to a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. This not only links a decrease in olfactory learning ability to abnormal neural connectivity but also provides evidence that imidacloprid damages the development of the nervous system in regions responsible for both olfaction and vision during the larval stage of the honey bee.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep19298,6.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955297378&doi=10.1038%2fsrep19298&partnerID=40&md5=2f1eeec397546a1e15abccf85d931d6b,Scopus,,,,,,0,294,0,

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013///,2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4.0,,,,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000346774000013,,,0,295,0,

However, their abundance and diversity have been on a steady decrease in the last decades. One of the most important factors leading to their decline is the frequent use of plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture, which spread into forests and natural reserves. Mixtures of different PPPs pose a particular threat because of possible synergistic effects. While there is a comparatively large body of studies on the effects of PPPs on honeybees, we still lack data on wild bees. We here investigated the influence of the frequent fungicide Cantus¬Æ Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan¬Æ (acetamiprid) and their combination on bumblebees. Cognitive performance and foraging flights of bumblebees were studied. They are essential for the provisioning and survival of the colony. We introduce a novel method for testing four treatments simultaneously on the same colony, minimizing inter-colony differences. For this, we successfully quartered the colony and moved the queen daily between compartments. Bumblebees appeared astonishingly resilient to the PPPs tested or they have developed mechanisms for detoxification. Neither learning capacity nor flight activity were inhibited by treatment with the single PPPs or their combination. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108608,186.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189564332&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2024.108608&partnerID=40&md5=9fc756abf41a340efaed788ab5e021fe,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'foraging behavior', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'pesticide', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'learning', 'physiology', 'foraging', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'flight', 'Insecticide', 'mortality', 'cognition', 'bumblebee', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'fungicide', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Synergistic effect', 'agriculture', 'Fungicides', '2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'dimoxystrobin', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergistic effect', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'synergism', 'Plant protection products', 'boscalid', 'Fungicide', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'biphenyl derivative', 'catering service', 'Cognitive performance', 'color preference test', 'forest', 'Forest reserves', 'Forestry', 'Natural reserves', 'Niacinamide', 'nicotinamide', 'Novel methods', 'Pesticide mixtures', 'pesticide resistance', 'plant protection product', 'Synergistic effects', 'Wild bee', 'Wild bees']",,,,,0,296,0,

However, there is limited information about the effect of these stressors on other pollinators such as stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Meliponini). We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation.

The composition of the microbial community can be used as a biological health indicator and is characterized using biomarker fatty acids. Commonly, gut microorganisms are exposed to pathogens and to an array of chemical and biological pest control methods. RESULTS: We found a strong negative effect on microbial gut community composition when exposed to the bee pest control chemicals oxytetracycline, oxalic acid and imidacloprid, and when inoculated with the bee pest Nosema spp. and the potential bee pest biocontrol agent Lactobacillus plantarum. Results from the in vitro test with bee pest chemicals showed a differential response of Lactobacillus spp. At the community level, some taxonomic groups were more affected depending on treatment, but sharp changes in the microbial structure were caused by compounds generally considered as bee safe. CONCLUSION: Our results show that pests such as Nosema spp. and pest control methods alter the composition of bee gut microorganisms, which may have severe consequences for pathogen defense, physiology and general honey bee health.

303,583,JOUR,COLONY IMPACT OF PESTICIDE-INDUCED SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON HONEYBEE WORKERS: A SIMULATION STUDY USING BEEHAVE,"['Thorbek, P', 'Campbell, PJ', 'Thompson, HM']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

199,479,JOUR,The impact of pollen quality on the sensitivity of bumblebees to pesticides,"['Barraud, A.', 'Vanderplanck, M.', 'Nadarajah, S.', 'Michez, D.']",Acta Oecologica,"With 2000 species currently recorded in Europe, bees are a highly diversified and efficient group of pollinating insects. Their decline could therefore lead to a risk for ecosystems functioning and crop yields. The drivers of this decline have been well documented in Europe and involve multiple factors such as pesticides, pathogens, poor nutrition, climate change, and their respective interactions. For pesticides, there is a lack of information concerning the impacts of exposure when the bees have access to pollen diet of different nutritional quality (e.g. variation in sterol and protein content). We performed bioassays on nine groups consisting of 10 Bombus terrestris microcolonies (i.e. queen less colonies) each in a fully crossed experiment including controls without pesticide, two different doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid (2 and 20 Œºg/L) and three pollen diets (i.e. Salix mix, cellulose-diluted Salix mix and cellulose-diluted Salix mix enriched with soy protein). All colonies were fed ad libitum with syrup and pollen. We measured the collection of pollen and syrup, the brood mass and the pollen efficacy (ratio of brood mass/pollen) at the end of the experiment. All these variables were affected by the imidacloprid doses, especially pollen efficacy, which was two and 10 times lower than the control for the 2 and 20 Œºg/L treatments, respectively. As expected, pollen efficacy was also affected by the pollen diet. However, when exposed to imidacloprid, the three different pollen diets did not affect micro-colonies performances. Overall, we show that diet quality does not affect sensitivity to imidacloprid exposure. It seems therefore that the negative effects of imidacloprid exposure cannot be compensated for by a pollen diet of high quality. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.actao.2020.103552,105.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084259658&doi=10.1016%2fj.actao.2020.103552&partnerID=40&md5=a8c642efd52675587a10ca5e1a433a27,Scopus,,,,,,0,300,0,

Additionally, reduced access to forage in agricultural areas creates the potential for risk interactions with these pesticides in regions critical for honey production. In this study, we sought to determine whether sufficient access to pollen during larval development could mitigate stress associated with oral clothianidin exposure in honey bee adults. An apiary was established where pollen traps deprived half of the colonies of pollen, which was then supplemented to the others. Adults were fed 0, 10, 40, 200, or 400 ¬µg/L clothianidin in the laboratory, and larval and adult lipids and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were compared between feeding treatments. Survival at sublethal concentrations of clothianidin was significantly reduced for adult bees reared in pollen deprived colonies. Adult SOD activity was affected by clothianidin dose but not larval feeding treatment, though within the pollen-deprived cohort, SOD was greater in controls than those fed clothianidin. Larval SOD differed between field replicates, with supplemented colonies having slightly higher activity levels during a period of pollen dearth, indicating that supplementation during these periods is particularly important for mitigating oxidative stress within the hive. Larval lipids were significantly higher in supplemented colonies during a substantial pollen flow, though adult lipids were unaffected by feeding treatment. These results suggest that during periods of pollen dearth, oxidative stress and adult worker longevity will be improved by supplementing colonies with locally collected pollen. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 ŒºL 1¬†M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 ŒºL of 1.5¬†M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 ŒºL 0.5¬†M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30¬†min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed. We observed acute, mild effects on foraging by honey bees, so mild that storage of imidacloprid tainted-honey is very plausible and likely to be found in honey bee colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2015///,2015,10.1007/s10646-015-1537-2,24.0,9,2017,2025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948105114&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-015-1537-2&partnerID=40&md5=9c6be28f653d8d0189fb78790d94c8dd,Scopus,,,,,,0,302,0,

These pollination services are driven, in part, by energetic exchanges between flowering plants and individual bees. Thus, it is important to examine bumble bee energy metabolism and explore how it might be influenced by external stressors contributing to declines in global pollinator populations. Two stressors that are commonly encountered by bees are insecticides, such as the neonicotinoids, and nutritional stress, resulting from deficits in pollen and nectar availability. Our study uses a metabolomic approach to examine the effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure on bumble bee metabolism, both alone and in combination with nutritional stress. We hypothesized that exposure to imidacloprid disrupts bumble bee energy metabolism, leading to changes in key metabolites involved in central carbon metabolism. We tested this by exposing Bombus impatiens workers to imidacloprid according to one of three exposure paradigms designed to explore how chronic versus more acute (early or late) imidacloprid exposure influences energy metabolite levels, then also subjecting them to artificial nectar starvation. The strongest effects of imidacloprid were observed when bees also experienced nectar starvation, suggesting a combinatorial effect of neonicotinoids and nutritional stress on bumble bee energy metabolism. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on pollinators, and underscores the need for further investigation into the complex interactions between environmental stressors and energy metabolism. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169388,912.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85181045872&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.169388&partnerID=40&md5=e96c410d5f834c615e3245a4c2e599e4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollination', 'Imidacloprids', 'nectar', 'Apidae', 'Plant Nectar', 'bumblebee', 'metabolism', 'environmental stress', 'Flowering plants', 'pesticide application', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'Bombus impatiens', 'Bumble bees', 'metabolomics', 'Metabolomics', 'angiosperm', 'physiological stress', 'Metabolism', 'energy metabolism', 'Energy metabolism', 'Bumble bee', 'carbon metabolism', 'Central carbon metabolisms', 'Energy Metabolism', 'nutrient', 'nutrient dynamics', 'Nutrients', 'Nutritional stress', 'starvation']",,,,,0,303,0,
50,330,JOUR,The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation,"['Zhang, E.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory - cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 Œºg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 Œºg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. ¬© 2015.

Among the main drivers of diminishing bee populations is the widespread use of agrochemicals. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the foraging dynamics of bees at agrochemical-contaminated areas, it is essential to consider both environmental conditions and the specific foraging ecology of bee species. For the first time, we conducted a semi-field study to investigate whether stingless bees exhibit a preference for food contaminated with agrochemicals compared to non- contaminated food, under natural weather conditions. Colonies of Plebeia lucii Moure, 2004 were placed in a greenhouse and subjected to a preference test, where bees were given the freedom to choose between contaminated or non-contaminated food sources following a preliminary training period. Within the greenhouse, we placed feeders containing realistic concentrations of an insecticide (acephate: 2 mg a.i./L), a herbicide (glyphosate: 31.3 mg a.i./L), or a mixture of both, alongside non- contaminated food. Environmental variables (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) were monitored throughout the experiment. At higher temperatures, the foragers preferred food containing the mixture of both agrochemicals or uncontaminated food over the other treatments. At lower temperatures, by contrast, the bees preferred food laced with a single agrochemical (acephate or glyphosate) over uncontaminated food or the agrochemical mixture. Our findings indicate that agrochemical residues in nectar pose a significant threat to P. lucii colonies, as foragers do not actively avoid contaminated food, despite the detrimental effects of acephate and glyphosate on bees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even minor, natural fluctuations in environmental conditions can alter the colony exposure risk.

This study analyzed the effects of field realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on adult bees infested and not infested with V. destructor over 21 consecutive days and then determined bee survivorship, weight, deformed wing virus (DWV) levels and gene expression. V. destructor parasitism with or without clothianidin exposure was significantly associated with decreased survivorship, weight loss and higher DWV levels, while clothianidin exposure was only associated with higher levels of DWV. Expression analysis of the neural genes AmNlg-1, BlCh and AmAChE-2 showed that V. destructor caused a significant down-regulation of all of them, whereas clothianidin caused a significant down-regulation of only AmNrx-1 and BlCh. An interaction was only detected for AmNrx-1 expression. RNAseq analysis showed that clothianidin exposure resulted in 6.5 times more up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than V. destructor alone and 123 times more than clothianidin combined with V. destructor. Similar results were obtained with down-regulated DEGs, except for a higher number of DEGs shared between V. destructor and the combined stressors. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) biological pathway analysis of the DEGs showed that the stressor linked to the highest number of KEGG pathways was clothianidin, followed by V. destructor, and then considerably fewer number of KEGG pathways with the combined stressors.

To assess if exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin via a treated crop (rapeseed) affected bee behaviour, pollination performance (to strawberry), and bee reproduction, we provided each of 12 outdoor cages with rapeseed (autumn-sown plants complemented with a few spring-sown plants to extend the flowering period) grown from either clothianidin-treated or untreated (control) seeds, together with strawberry plants and a small population of red mason bees (Osmia bicornis). We expected clothianidin to reduce bee foraging activity, resulting in impaired strawberry pollination and bee reproduction. During the early stage of the experiment, we observed no difference between treatments in the length of entire foraging trips, or the combined number of rapeseed and strawberry flowers that the bees visited during these trips. During the later stage of the experiment, we instead determined the time a female took to visit 10 rapeseed flowers, as a proxy for foraging performance. We found that they were 10% slower in clothianidin cages. Strawberries weighed less in clothianidin cages, suggesting reduced pollination performance, but we were unable to relate this to reduced foraging activity, because the strawberry flowers received equally many visits in the two treatments. Clothianidin-exposed females sealed their nests less often, but offspring number, sex ratio and weight were similar between treatments. Observed effects on bee behaviour appeared by the end of the experiment, possibly because of accumulated effects of exposure, reduced bee longevity, or higher sensitivity of the protocols we used during the later phase of the experiment. Although the lack of a mechanistic explanation calls for interpreting the results with cautiousness, the lower strawberry weight in clothianidin cages highlights the importance of understanding complex effects of plant protection products, which could have wider consequences than those on directly exposed organisms.  ¬© 2022 Herbertsson et al.

We tested the effects of field realistic doses of 0.8 ng/bee and 1.34 ng/bee of the neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam (TMX), on bee visual learning. We adapted a T-maze bioassay and classically conditioned bees to associate sugar reward with a simulated flower color (blue or yellow light) in a choice assay. At 1.34 ng/bee, TMX significantly reduced correct choices in the final learning trial as compared to the control treatment. There was no TMX effect in our 1-h memory test. We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices. Behaviors (falling, trembling, and rapid abnormal movements) were significantly increased by both TMX doses as compared to the control treatment.

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 ¬µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Both biotic and abiotic factors are involved in this phenomenon that is often associated with high loads of parasites and pathogens. A stronger impact of pathogens in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticides has been reported, but the causal link between insecticide exposure and the possible immune alteration of honey bees remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin negatively modulates NF-Œ∫B immune signaling in insects and adversely affects honey bee antiviral defenses controlled by this transcription factor. We have identified in insects a negative modulator of NF-Œ∫B activation, which is a leucine-rich repeat protein. Exposure to clothianidin, by enhancing the transcription of the gene encoding this inhibitor, reduces immune defenses and promotes the replication of the deformed wing virus in honey bees bearing covert infections. This honey bee immunosuppression is similarly induced by a different neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, but not by the organophosphate chlorpyriphos, which does not affect NF-Œ∫B signaling. The occurrence at sublethal doses of this insecticide-induced viral proliferation suggests that the studied neonicotinoids might have a negative effect at the field level. Our experiments uncover a further level of regulation of the immune response in insects and set the stage for studies on neural modulation of immunity in animals.

172,452,JOUR,"Context-Dependent Effect of Dietary Phytochemicals on Honey Bees Exposed to a Pesticide, Thiamethoxam","['Seshadri, A.', 'Bernklau, E.']",Journal of Insect Science,"Honey bees continue to face challenges relating to the degradation of natural flowering habitats that limit their access to diverse floral resources. While it is known that nectar and pollen provide macronutrients, flowers also contain secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that impart benefits including increased longevity, improved gut microbiome abundance, and pathogen tolerance. Our study aims to understand the role of phytochemicals in pesticide tolerance when worker bees were fed with sublethal doses (1 ppb and 10 ppb) of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, in 20% (w/v) sugar solution supplemented with 25 ppm of phytochemicals - caffeine, kaempferol, gallic acid, or p-coumaric acid, previously shown to have beneficial impacts on bee health. The effect of phytochemical supplementation during pesticide exposure was context-dependent. With 1 ppb TMX, phytochemical supplementation increased longevity but at 10 ppb TMX, longevity was reduced suggesting a negative synergistic effect. Phytochemicals mixed with 1 ppb TMX increased mortality in bees of the forager-age group but with 10 ppb TMX, mortality of the inhive-age group increased, implying the possibility of accumulation effect in lower sublethal doses. Given that the phytochemical composition of pollen and nectar varies between plant species, we suggest that the negative impacts of agrochemicals on honey bees could vary based on the phytochemicals in pollen and nectar of that crop, and hence the effects may vary across crops. Analyzing the phytochemical composition for individual crops may be a necessary first step prior to determining the appropriate dosage of agrochemicals so that harm to bees Apis mellifera L. is minimized while crop pests are effectively controlled. ¬© 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2021///,2021,10.1093/jisesa/ieab053,21.0,4,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114690801&doi=10.1093%2fjisesa%2fieab053&partnerID=40&md5=13964c9033de5e523ac2d2d3aec523c0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollinator', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'honey bee', 'phytochemical', 'synergism', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'kaempferol', 'coumaric acid', 'caffeine', 'Phytochemicals', 'p-coumaric acid', 'Caffeine', 'Coumaric Acids', 'dietary supplement', 'Dietary Supplements', 'gallic acid', 'Gallic Acid', 'kaempferol derivative', 'Kaempferols']",,,,,0,314,0,

The use of products with toxic effects is banned during flowering, and precise pre-flowering intervals have to be respected in Good Agricultural Practice. Bee pollination is essential for fruit crops to guarantee maximal fruit quality (shape and size) and quantity (yield weight). Fruit growers in Belgium depend mostly on non-commercial beekeepers to provide sufficient colonies for adequate pollination. Under optimal circumstances, beekeepers and fruit growers have mutual benefits from this cooperation as both honey and fruit yield increase. In those European countries with a monitoring scheme, acute bee poisoning incidents have decreased considerably and hardly cause problems at present. In recent years, some concerns arose around sublethal effects (i.e., behavioural changes) of chemical crop protection on bees, especially with regard to increased winter mortality.

However, the contribution of the honey bee gut microbiota to host detoxification ability has yet to be investigated. In order to address this question, we compared the expression of cytochrome P450s (P450s) genes between gut microbiota deficient (GD) workers and conventional gut community (CV) workers and compared the mortality rates and the pesticide residue levels of GD and CV workers treated with thiacloprid or tau-fluvalinate. Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees. Taken together, our results demonstrated that honey bee gut symbiont could contribute to bee health through the modification of the host xenobiotics detoxification pathways and revealed a potential negative impact of antibiotics to honey bee detoxification ability and health. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy.

However, by altering behavioural or physiological responses of insects, extreme heat events may also affect pollination services on which many crops are dependent. Such effects may potentially be exacerbated by other environmental stresses, such as exposure to widely used agro-chemicals. To determine whether environmental stressors interact to affect pollination services, we carried out field cage experiments on the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris). Using a Bayesian approach, we assessed whether heat stress (colonies maintained at an ambient temperature of 25‚ó¶C or 31‚ó¶C) and insecticide exposure (5 ng g‚Äì1 of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin) could induce behavioural changes that affected pollination of faba bean (Vicia faba). Only the bumble bee colonies and not the plants were exposed to the environmental stress treatments. Bean plants exposed to heat-stressed bumble bee colonies (31‚ó¶C) had a lower proportional pod set compared to colonies maintained at 25‚ó¶C. There was also weak evidence that heat stressed colonies caused lower total bean weight. Bee exposure to clothianidin was found to have no clear effect on plant yields, either individually or as part of an interaction. We identified no effect of either colony stressor on bumble bee foraging behaviours. Our results suggest that extreme heat stress at the colony level may impact on pollination services. However, as the effect for other key yield parameters was weaker (e.g., bean yields), our results are not conclusive. Overall, our study highlights the need for further research on how environmental stress affects behavioural interactions in plant-pollinator systems that could impact on crop yields. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

High average annual losses of honey bee colonies in the US have been partially attributed to agrochemical exposure and virus infections. To examine the potential negative synergistic impacts of agrochemical exposure and virus infection, as well as the potential promise of phytochemicals to ameliorate the impact of pathogenic infections on honey bees, we infected bees with a panel of viruses (i.e., Flock House virus, deformed wing virus, or Sindbis virus) and exposed to one of three chemical compounds. Specifically, honey bees were fed sucrose syrup containing: (1) thyme oil, a phytochemical and putative immune stimulant, (2) fumagillin, a beekeeper applied fungicide, or (3) clothianidin, a grower-applied insecticide. We determined that virus abundance was lower in honey bees fed 0.16 ppm thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup, compared to bees fed sucrose syrup alone. Parallel analysis of honey bee gene expression revealed that honey bees fed thyme oil augmented sucrose syrup had higher expression of key RNAi genes (argonaute-2 and dicer-like), antimicrobial peptide expressing genes (abaecin and hymenoptaecin), and vitellogenin, a putative honey bee health and age indicator, compared to bees fed only sucrose syrup. Virus abundance was higher in bees fed fumagillin (25 ppm or 75 ppm) or 1 ppb clothianidin containing sucrose syrup relative to levels in bees fed only sucrose syrup. Whereas, honey bees fed 10 ppb clothianidin had lower virus levels, likely because consuming a near lethal dose of insecticide made them poor hosts for virus infection. The negative impact of fumagillin and clothianidin on honey bee health was indicated by the lower expression of argonaute-2, dicer-like, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin, and vitellogenin. Together, these results indicate that chemical stimulants and stressors impact the outcome of virus infection and immune gene expression in honey bees.

Therefore, we tested the current hypotheses describing honeybee losses as a multifactorial syndrome, by investigating integrative effects of an infectious organism and an insecticide on honeybee health. We demonstrated that the interaction between the microsporidia Nosema and a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) significantly weakened honeybees. In the short term, the combination of both agents caused the highest individual mortality rates and energetic stress. By quantifying the strength of immunity at both the individual and social levels, we showed that neither the haemocyte number nor the phenoloxidase activity of individuals was affected by the different treatments.

The challenges posed by novel and reemerging pathogens on bee health means we need to improve our understanding of the immune system, an important barrier to infections and disease. Despite the importance of solitary bees, which are ecologically relevant, our understanding of the genomic basis and molecular mechanisms underlying their immune potential, and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors may influence it is limited. To improve our understanding of the genomic architecture underlying immunity of a key solitary bee pollinator, we characterized putative immune genes of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis. In addition, we used publicly available RNA-seq datasets to determine how sexes differ in immune gene expression and splicing but also how pesticide exposure may affect immune gene expression in females. Through comparative genomics, we reveal an evolutionarily conserved set of more than 500 putative immune-related genes. We found genome-wide patterns of sex-biased gene expression, with greater enrichment of immune-related processes among genes with higher constitutive expression in males than females. Our results also suggest an up-regulation of immune-related genes in response to exposure to two common neonicotinoids, thiacloprid and imidacloprid. Collectively, our study provides important insights into the gene repertoire, regulation and expression differences in the sexes of O. bicornis, as well as providing additional support for how neonicotinoids can affect immune gene expression, which may affect the capacity of solitary bees to respond to pathogenic threats. ¬© 2022 The Authors.

Yet, we lack good quantification of how temperature modulates the sublethal effects of pesticides on behaviours vital for fitness and pollination performance. Consequently, we are uncertain if warming decreases or increases the severity of different pesticide impacts, and whether separate behaviours vary in the direction of response. Quantifying these interactive effects is vital in forecasting pesticide risk across climate regions and informing pesticide application strategies and pollinator conservation. This multi-stressor study investigated the responses of six functional behaviours of bumblebees when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) or a sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) across a standardised low, mid, and high temperature. We found the neonicotinoid had a significant effect on five of the six behaviours, with a greater effect at the lower temperature(s) when measuring responsiveness, the likelihood of movement, walking rate, and food consumption rate. In contrast, the neonicotinoid had a greater impact on flight distance at the higher temperature. Our findings show that different organismal functions can exhibit divergent thermal responses, with some pesticide-affected behaviours showing greater impact as temperatures dropped, and others as temperatures rose. We must therefore account for environmental context when determining pesticide risk. Moreover, we found evidence of synergistic effects, with just a 3 degrees C increase causing a sudden drop in flight performance, despite seeing no effect of pesticide at the two lower temperatures.

However, since few decades, managed bee colonies have declined worldwide. This phenomenon is considered to be multifactorial, with a strong emphasis on both parasites and pesticides. Infection by the parasite Nosema ceranae and exposure to pesticides can contribute to adverse effects, resulting in a perturbation of the honeybee physiology. We thus hypothesized that probiotic treatment could be promising to treat or prevent these disturbances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics on N. ceranae-infected and intoxicated honeybees (by the insecticide thiamethoxam and the fungicide boscalid). For this purpose, experiments were conducted with five probiotics. Among them, Pediococcus acidilactici (PA) showed the best protective effect against the parasite and pesticides. PA significantly improved the infected honeybee lifespan as prophylactic and curative treatments (respectively 2.3 fold and 1.7 fold). Furthermore, the exposure to pesticides induced an increase of honeybee mortality compared with the control group (p < .001) that was restored by the PA treatment. Despite its beneficial effect on honeybee lifespan, the PA administration did not induce changes in the gut bacterial communities (neither in abundance or diversity). N. ceranae and the pesticides were shown to deregulate genes involved in honeybee development (vitellogenin), immunity (serine protease 40, defensin) and detoxification system (glutathione peroxidase-like 2, catalase), and these effects were corrected by the PA treatment.

As honeybee colonies can be frequently exposed to bio-aggressors in real conditions, often concomitantly with pesticides, co-exposure to pesticidei/bio-aggressors is becoming a concern for regulatory authorities. We investigated the effects of the neonicotinoid insecticide thiamethoxam on the homing performances of foragers emerging from colonies differentiated by health status (infestation with Varroa destructor mites, microsporidian parasite Nosema spp. and Deformed Wing Virus). We designed a homing test that has been recently identified to fill a regulatory gap in the field evaluations of sublethal doses of pesticides before their registration. We also assessed the effect of temperature as an environmental factor. Our results showed that the Varroa mite exacerbates homing failure (HF) caused by the insecticide, whereas high temperatures reduce insecticide-induced HF.

269,549,JOUR,Searching beyond the streetlight: Neonicotinoid exposure alters the neurogenomic state of worker honey bees,"['Tsvetkov, N.', 'Zayed, A.']",Ecology and Evolution,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in honey bee declines, with many studies showing that sublethal exposure impacts bee behaviors such as foraging, learning, and memory. Despite the large number of ecotoxicological studies carried out to date, most focus on a handful of worker phenotypes leading to a ‚Äústreetlight effect‚Äù where the a priori choice of phenotypes to measure may influence the results and conclusions arising from the studies. This bias can be overcome with the use of toxicological transcriptomics, where changes in gene expression can provide a more objective view of how pesticides alter animal traits. Here, we used RNA sequencing to examine the changes in neurogenomic states of nurse and forager honey bees that were naturally exposed to neonicotinoids in the field and artificially exposed to neonicotinoids in a controlled experiment. We found that neonicotinoid exposure influenced the neurogenomic state of foragers and nurses in different ways; foragers experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in cognition and development, while nurses experienced shifts in expression of genes involved in metabolism. Our study suggests that neonicotinoids influence nurse and forager bees in a different manner. We also found no to minimal overlap in the differentially expressed genes in our study and in previously published studies, which might help reconcile the seemingly contradictory results often reported in the neonicotinoid literature. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

However, in recent years, the number of honeybee colonies is diminishing rapidly, which is probably linked to the wide use of neonicotinoid insecticides. Middle-aged honeybees were fed with 50% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg/L thiacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) for up to 13 days, and on each day of exposure experiment, percentage survival, sucrose consumption, and bodyweight of honeybees were measured. Further, changes in honeybee gut microbial community were examined using next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on day 1, 7, and 13 of the exposure. When compared to control-treatment, continuous exposure to high (0.6 mg/L) and very high (2.0 mg/L) concentrations of thiacloprid significantly reduced percentage survival of honeybees (p < 0.001) and led to dysbiosis of their gut microbial community on day 7 of the exposure. However, during subsequent developmental stages of middle-aged honeybees (i.e. on day 13), their gut microbiome recovered from dysbiosis that occurred previously due to thiacloprid exposure. Taken together, improper application of thiacloprid can cause loss of honeybee colonies, while the microbial gut community of honeybee is an independent variable in this process.",2020/05/05/,2020,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121818,389.0,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'controlled study', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'sucrose', 'toxicity', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'adult', 'colony', 'Sugar (sucrose)', 'growth, development and aging', 'thiacloprid', 'body weight', 'Thiacloprid', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystems', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'biodiversity', 'Biodiversity', 'high throughput sequencing', 'intestine flora', 'pollutant', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'microbial community', 'Microorganisms', 'species conservation', 'amplicon', 'digestive system', 'dysbiosis', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Continuous exposure', 'DNA 16S', 'middle aged', 'food availability', 'microbial activity', 'Microbial communities', 'Developmental stage', 'Gut microbial community', 'Independent variables', 'Middle-aged honeybee', 'Percentage survival', 'Recovery from dysbiosis']",0304-3894,WOS:000524479100003,,,0,332,0,

Clothianidin neonicotinoid appears to impair the microbe‚Äìimmunity axis. We conducted cage experiments on newly emerged bees that were 4‚Äì6 days old and used a 16S rRNA metataxonomic approach to measure the impact of three sublethal clothianidin concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) on survival, sucrose syrup consumption and gut microbiota community structure. Exposure to clothianidin significantly increased mortality in the three concentrations compared to controls. Interestingly, the lowest clothianidin concentration was associated with the highest mortality, and the medium concentration with the highest food intake. Exposure to clothianidin induced significant variation in the taxonomic distribution of gut microbiota activity. Co-abundance network analysis revealed local dysbiosis signatures specific to each gut section (midgut, ileum and rectum) were driven by specific taxa. Our findings confirm that exposure to clothianidin triggers a reshuffling of beneficial strains and/or potentially pathogenic taxa within the gut, suggesting a honeybee‚Äôs symbiotic defense systems‚Äô disruption, such as resistance to microbial colonization. This study highlights the role of weak transcriptional activity taxa in maintaining a stable honeybee gut microbiota.

Such new, anthropogenic stressors include the neonicotinoid class of crop-protecting agents, which have been implicated in the population declines of pollinating insects, including honeybees (Apis mellifera). The low-dose effects of these compounds on larval development and physiological responses have remained largely unknown. Over a period of 15 days, we provided syrup tainted with low levels (2 mu g/L-1) of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid to beehives located in the field. We measured transcript levels by RNA sequencing and established lipid profiles using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry from worker-bee larvae of imidacloprid-exposed (IE) and unexposed, control (C) hives. Within a catalogue of 300 differentially expressed transcripts in larvae from IE hives, we detect significant enrichment of genes functioning in lipid-carbohydrate-mitochondrial metabolic networks. Myc-involved transcriptional response to exposure of this neonicotinoid is indicated by overrepresentation of E-box elements in the promoter regions of genes with altered expression. RNA levels for a cluster of genes encoding detoxifying P450 enzymes are elevated, with coordinated downregulation of genes in glycolytic and sugar-metabolising pathways. Expression of the environmentally responsive Hsp90 gene is also reduced, suggesting diminished buffering and stability of the developmental program. The multifaceted, physiological response described here may be of importance to our general understanding of pollinator health.

209,489,JOUR,Non-optimal ambient temperatures aggravate insecticide toxicity and affect honey bees Apis mellifera L. gene regulation,"['Alburaki, M.', 'Madella, S.', 'Cook, S.C.']",Scientific Reports,"In this study, we conducted a transcriptional analysis of five honey bee genes to examine their functional involvement vis-√†-vis ambient temperatures and exposure to imidacloprid. In a 15-day cage experiment, three cohorts of one-day-old sister bees emerged in incubators, were distributed into cages, and maintained at three different temperatures (26¬†¬∞C, 32¬†¬∞C, 38¬†¬∞C). Each cohort was fed a protein patty and three concentrations of imidacloprid-tainted sugar (0¬†ppb, 5¬†ppb and 20¬†ppb) ad libitum. Honey bee mortality, syrup and patty consumption were monitored daily over 15¬†days. Bees were sampled every three days for a total of five time points. RT-qPCR was used to longitudinally assess gene regulation of Vg, mrjp1, Rsod, AChE-2 and Trx-1 using RNA extracted from whole bee bodies. Kaplan‚ÄìMeier models show that bees kept at both non-optimal temperatures (26¬†¬∞C and 38¬†¬∞C) were more susceptible to imidacloprid, with significantly higher mortality (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) compared to the control. At 32¬†¬∞C, no differences in mortality (P = 0.3) were recorded among treatments. In both imidacloprid treatment groups and the control, the expression of Vg and mrjp1 was significantly downregulated at 26¬†¬∞C and 38¬†¬∞C compared to the optimal temperature of 32¬†¬∞C, indicating major influence of ambient temperature on the regulation of these genes. Within the ambient temperature groups, both imidacloprid treatments exclusively downregulated Vg and mrjp1 at 26¬†¬∞C. AChE-2 and the poorly characterized Rsod gene were both consistently upregulated at the highest temperature (38¬†¬∞C) compared to the ideal temperature (32¬†¬∞C) in all treatment groups. Trx-1 showed no effect to both temperature and imidacloprid treatments and was regulated in an age-related manner. Overall, our results indicate that ambient temperatures amplify imidacloprid toxicity and affect honey bee gene regulation. ¬© 2023, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.",2023///,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-30264-0,13.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85149684649&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-30264-0&partnerID=40&md5=95e4c6ac4d47b7906cde9b5f38f62d79,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'temperature', 'Temperature', 'genetics']",,,,,0,335,0,

Recently, many Japanese beekeepers have implied that midsummer use of a new insecticide, neonicotinoid, in rice fields, is causing widespread mortality of neighboring honeybees and frequently resulting in colony collapse. Since few field experiments have directly tested the effects of neonicotinoids, I addressed four research questions in the field. The questions are: 1) Does clothianidin application in rice fields cause the collapse of neighboring honeybee colonies? 2) Is colony collapse related to hive distance from the rice field? 3) Is the number of dead honeybee workers after spraying, related to hive distance from the field? 4) What are the long-term effects of neonicotinoid use on honeybee colony growth, especially brood production? In the late summer of 2010, honeybee hives were placed adjacent to two separate rice fields for 1 week. The hives were placed at the distance of 0, 30, 60, and 90 m. After spraying clothianidin, a daily count of dead worker honeybees was done for a week. Hives were weighed, and capped-brood areas were estimated weekly, for 2 months following insecticide application. Although the average number of dead workers ranged from 40 to over 100 within 24 hours after spraying, only a few dead workers were observed in the subsequent days. Distance from the rice field had no significant effect on the number of dead workers. There were no collapsed colonies during the 2-month, post-spray observation period. Hive weight and capped-brood area did not significantly differ among those hives placed at varying distances from the rice field. These results indicated that clothianidin spraying of the rice field increased the mortality of the honeybees, but did not always cause colony collapse.",2013///,2013,10.2478/JAS-2013-0014,57.0,2,21,35,,,,1643-4439,WOS:000328723400002,,,0,336,0,
270,550,JOUR,"Sublethal acetamiprid exposure induces immunity, suppresses pathways linked to juvenile hormone synthesis in queens and affects cycle-related signaling in emerging bees","['Erban, T.', 'Markovic, M.', 'Sopko, B.']",Environmental Pollution,"Acetamiprid is the only neonicotinoid registered in the European Union because the risks of neonicotinoids to honey bees and other pollinators are strictly regulated. Herein, we orally exposed honey bee colonies to sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid (20 Œºg/L) under isolated conditions. After one month of continuous exposure, the emerging bees and queens were collected and analyzed via high-throughput label-free quantitative proteomics using a data-independent acquisition strategy. Six and 34 significantly differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in the emerging bees and queens, respectively. Mrjp3 was the only DEP found in both sample types/castes, and its opposite regulation illustrated a differential response. The DEPs in the emerging bees (H/ACA RNP, Rap1GAP, Mrjp3, and JHE) suggested that sublethal exposure to acetamiprid affected cell cycle-related signaling, which may affect the life history of workers in the colony. The DEPs with increased levels in queens, such as Mrjps 1‚Äì4 and 6‚Äì7, hymenoptaecin, and apidaecin 22, indicated an activated immune response. Additionally, the level of farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), which is essential for the mevalonate pathway and juvenile hormone biosynthesis, was significantly decreased in queens. The impaired utilization of juvenile hormone in queens supported the identification of additional DEPs. Furthermore, the proteome changes suggested the existence of increased neonicotinoid detoxification by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and increased amino acid metabolism. The results suggest that the continuous exposure of bee colonies to acetamiprid at low doses (nanograms per gram in feed) may pose a threat to the colonies. The different exposure routes and durations for the emerging bees and queens in our experiment must be considered, i.e., the emerging bees were exposed as larvae via feeding royal jelly and beebread provided by workers (nurse bees), whereas the queens were fed royal jelly throughout the experiment. The biological consequences of the proteomic changes resulting from sublethal/chronic exposure require future determination. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123901,349.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85189754379&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.123901&partnerID=40&md5=0ef2ce1fe730183f9cf7fa2ed927a347,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pollen', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'drug effect', 'chromatography', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'thiamethoxam', 'Insecticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Honey bee', 'sublethal concentration', 'long term exposure', 'unclassified drug', ""Workers'"", 'Chronic exposure', 'Proteins', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'nanoliquid chromatography', 'proteomics', 'Proteomics', 'bioinformatics', 'protein', 'Female', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'queen (insect)', 'immunity', 'Biochemistry', 'Juvenile hormone', 'Molecular biology', 'false discovery rate', 'juvenile hormone', 'Juvenile Hormones', 'signal transduction', 'royal jelly', 'Royal jelly', 'Cell signaling', 'biosynthesis', 'KEGG', 'apidaecin 22', 'cell cycle', 'Continuous exposure', 'data independent acquisition', 'differential expression analysis', 'differentially expressed protein', 'farnesyl diphosphate', 'farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase', 'functional enrichment analysis', 'glucuronosyltransferase', 'H/ ACA RNP', 'hormone synthesis', 'hymenoptaecin', 'JHE', 'juvenile hormone synthesis', 'Mrjp3', 'Mrjps 1', 'Mrjps 2', 'Mrjps 3', 'Mrjps 4', 'Mrjps 6', 'Mrjps 7', 'Rap1GAP', 'Signal Transduction', 'synthetase']",,,,,0,337,0,

This restriction did allow for the continued use of these seed treatments, in particular clothianidin, on non-flowering crops like winter wheat. To determine the impacts of the moratorium, we assessed neonicotinoid concentrations pre- (2014) and post- (2015‚àí17) moratorium in 347 honey samples collected across Great Britain. While the probability of detecting clothianidin declined immediately following the moratorium, detection rates remained constant over the following three years (mean = 0.10 ppb, maximum = 2.8 ppb). In contrast, after three years thiamethoxam residues entirely disappeared while detection of imidacloprid was infrequent but persistent over the whole period. For those hives where neonicotinoids were detected, there was no evidence that the concentrations in the honey declined over the three years following the ban. Using metabarcoding approaches, we identified plants foraged upon by honeybees during the production of honey. After the moratorium came into effect, the highest neonicotinoid residues were associated with honey produced by foraging on both oilseed rape and several wild plants found in arable field margins. Concerns about soil persistence and uptake by non-target flowering plants ultimately led to a full European Union ban in 2018. Our results suggest that before this full ban came into effect, the use of clothianidin on non-flowering crops maintained a low-level probability of encountering this neonicotinoid within honey. However, these concentrations were low and would have been unlikely to pose significant risks to honeybees. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.agee.2020.107205,308.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85097174852&doi=10.1016%2fj.agee.2020.107205&partnerID=40&md5=8f6a347f2b07a12f343674e475f6b35c,Scopus,"['imidacloprid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'clothianidin', 'honeybee', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Imidacloprid', 'Clothianidin', 'Magnoliophyta', 'Brassica napus', 'European Union', 'Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris', 'EU moratorium', 'Metabarcoding', 'sugar beet', 'United Kingdom']",,,,,0,338,0,

The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies. Therefore, our findings highlight the need to further study how ubiquitous stressors like V. destructor and neonicotinoids interact to affect honey bees. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.137535,313.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144613712&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2022.137535&partnerID=40&md5=a31e7a9ca2d4e9ea94142b689c6df604,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pollution exposure', 'Apis mellifera', 'feeding behavior', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'adult', 'honey', 'Honey bee', 'mite', 'Varroa destructor', 'Varroidae', 'body mass', ""Workers'"", 'Parasite-', 'emergence', 'host parasite interaction', 'Mites', 'Honey', 'Host-Parasite Interactions', 'Abiotic', 'abiotic factor', 'antagonism', 'Antagonism', 'antagonistic effect', 'Biotic', 'Biotics', 'ectoparasite', 'Hypopharyngeal gland', 'Hypopharyngeal glands', 'hypopharynx', 'inclusive fitness', 'organ size', 'Parasite', 'parasite survival', 'parasitism', 'Stressor interaction', 'Stressor interactions']",,,,,0,339,0,

At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. ¬© 2017 Tesovnik et al.

In solitary bee species the direct link between each individual female and reproductive success offers the opportunity to evaluate effects on individuals. The present study investigated effects of exposure to winter oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed on reproductive behavior and output of solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) released in 6 pairs of fields over a 2-yr period and confined to tunnels in a single year. After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen. There were no significant effects from exposure to oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed from nest establishment through cell production to emergence under tunnel or field conditions.

135,415,JOUR,A long-term field study on the effects of dietary exposure of clothianidin to varroosis-weakened honey bee colonies,"['Siede, R.', 'Meixner, M.D.', 'Almanza, M.T.', 'Sch√∂ning, R.', 'Maus, C.', 'B√ºchler, R.']",Ecotoxicology,"Clothianidin is a commonly used systemic insecticide in seed treatments. Residues of clothianidin can occur in nectar and pollen as a result of within-plant-translocation. Foraging bees can collect contaminated nectar or pollen. Concerns have been brought forward that exposure to pesticide residues might affect colonies especially if they are weakened by varroosis. However, there are few scientific studies investigating such multiple-stressor scenarios in the context of the entire colony. To close this gapa field trial with 24 colonies was set up. The study design comprised four groups of six colonies each fed with uncontaminated sugar syrup ('C0'), or syrup spiked with 10 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C10'), 50 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C50') or 200 Œºg L‚àí1 clothianidin ('C200'). C10 represented a residue concentration that may exceptionally occur and therefore a worst-case scenario, the higher dietary concentrations exceed and do not reflect fieldrealistic levels. A substantial load of 8 mites of Varroa destructor per ten gram bees in autumn was adjusted. The colonies were followed up for 328 days.

Ecotoxicogenomics, including transcriptomics, measures responses in individual organisms at the molecular level which can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying phenotypic responses induced by one or more stressors and link impacts on individuals to populations. Here, fifth instar honey bee larvae were sampled from a previously reported field experiment exploring the phenotypic impacts of environmentally realistic chronic exposures of the pesticide imidacloprid (5 mu g.kg(-1) for six weeks) and the acaricide thymol (250 g.kg(-1) applied via Apiguard gel in-hive for four weeks), both separately and in combination. RNA-seq was used to discover individual and interactive chemical effects on larval gene expression and to uncover molecular mechanisms linked to reported adult and colony phenotypes. The separate and combined treatments had distinct gene expression profiles which represented differentially affected signaling and metabolic pathways. The molecular signature of the mixture was characterised by additive interactions in canonical stress responses associated with oxidative stress and detoxification, and non-additive interactions in secondary responses including developmental, neurological, and immune pathways. Novel emergent impacts on eye development genes correlated with long-term defects in visual learning performance as adults.

Even though there is consensus that neonicotinoid insecticides can impact non-target animal fertility, their possible impact on male mating success is currently unknown in bees. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid significantly reduces both mating success and sperm traits of male bumblebees. Sexually mature male Bombus terrestris exposed to a field-realistic concentration of thiamethoxam (20 ng g‚àí1) or not (controls) were mated with virgin gynes in the laboratory. The results confirm sublethal negative effects of thiamethoxam on sperm quantity and viability. While the latency to mate was reduced, mating success was significantly impaired in thiamethoxam-exposed males by 32% probably due to female choice. Gynes mated by exposed males revealed impaired sperm traits compared to their respective controls, which may lead to severe constraints for colony fitness. Our laboratory findings demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male mating success in bees. Given that holds true for the field, this provides a plausible mechanism contributing to declines of wild bee populations globally. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may therefore have previously overlooked inadvertent anti-aphrodisiac effects on non-target animals, thereby limiting conservation efforts. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.12.003,9.0,,36,45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121333656&doi=10.1016%2fj.toxrep.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=9c8a52666298f54787e4ac0b40d754fe,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'honeybee', 'thiamethoxam', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'body mass', 'Neonicotinoid insecticide', 'mate choice', 'mating', 'mating success', 'fertility', 'egg laying', 'Sperm', 'aphrodisiac agent', 'Drone', 'Gyne', 'Mating']",,,,,0,345,0,

Such effects can be direct effects from insecticide exposure, but neonicotinoids can affect plant physiology, and effects could therefore also be indirectly mediated by changes in plant phenology, attractiveness and nutritional value. Under controlled greenhouse conditions, we tested if seed treatment with the neonicotinoid clothianidin affected oilseed rape‚Äôs production of flower resources for bees and the content of the secondary plant products glucosinolates that provide defense against herbivores. Additionally, we tested if seed treatment affected the attractiveness of oilseed rape to flower visiting bumblebees, using outdoor mesocosms. Flowers and leaves of clothianidin-treated plants had different profiles of glucosinolates compared with untreated plants. Bumblebees in mesocosms foraged slightly more on untreated plants. Neither flower timing, flower size nor the production of pollen and nectar differed between treatments, and therefore cannot explain any preference for untreated oilseed rape. We instead propose that this small but significant preference for untreated plants was related to the altered glucosinolate profile caused by clothianidin.

Here, we chronically exposed newly emerged honey bees to imidacloprid, glyphosate and difenoconazole, individually and in a ternary mixture, at an environmental concentration of 0.1 mu g/L. We studied the effects of these exposures on the establishment of the gut microbiota, the physiological status, the longevity, and food consumption of the host. The core bacterial species were not affected by the exposure to the three pesticides. Negative effects were observed but they were restricted to few transient non-core bacterial species. However, in the absence of the core microbiota, the pesticides induced physiological disruption by directly altering the detoxification system, the antioxidant defenses, and the metabolism of the host. Our study indicates that even mild exposure to pesticides can directly alter the physiological homeostasis of newly emerged honey bees and particularly if the individuals exhibit a dysbiosis (i.e. mostly lack the core microbiota).

This has potential significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other pollinators are commonplace. We conducted an experiment where commercial bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ‚Äúconventional‚Äù seed that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ‚Äúorganic‚Äù seed that was not treated with pesticides. Samples of pollen were collected from corn plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1‚Äì0.8¬†ng/g) in pollen collected from all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic fields. Corn pollen was only rarely collected from bumble bee foragers and the vast majority of pollen was from wild plants around the corn fields. All hives appeared healthy and neonicotinoid seed treatments had no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers, where significantly fewer workers were recovered from hives placed next to conventional fields (96¬†¬±¬†15 workers per hive) compared to organic fields (127¬†¬±¬†17 workers per hive).

Recently, we found that bees in a two-choice assay prefer to consume solutions containing field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiamethoxam (TMX), to sucrose alone. This suggests that neonicotinoids enhance the rewarding properties of sucrose and that low, acute doses could improve learning and memory in bees. To test this, we trained foraging-age honeybees to learn to associate floral scent with a reward containing nectar-relevant concentrations of IMD and TMX and tested their short (STM) and long-term (LTM) olfactory memories. Contrary to our predictions, we found that none of the solutions enhanced the rate of olfactory learning and some of them impaired it. In particular, the effect of 10 nM IMD was observed by the second conditioning trial and persisted 24 h later. In most other groups, exposure to IMD and TMX affected STM but not LTM. Our data show that negative impacts of low doses of IMD and TMX do not require long-term exposure and suggest that impacts of neonicotinoids on olfaction are greater than their effects on rewarding memories.",2015/10/19/,2015,10.1038/srep15322,5.0,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000362988900001,,,0,349,0,

Here we describe a role of non-neuronal acetylcholine (ACh) for breeding of Apis mellifera carnica and a so far unknown effect of neonicotinoids on non-target insects. Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to >= 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food.",2016/06/10/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0156886,11.0,6,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000377564000029,,,0,350,0,

We established a healthy honey bee colony in each of 24 tents, planted either with monofloral maize, maize with a diverse flower strip or with monofloral Phacelia tanacetifolia. To evaluate the interaction between exposure to PPPs and nutritional status, a mixture of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide prochloraz was applied. For each colony, we investigated brood capping rate as well as adult longevity, body and head weight, and enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase of newly hatched worker bees. We found a significant reduced capping rate in treated maize compared to flowering strips and Phacelia, but no interaction effect between pesticide treatment and nutritional status on capping rate. The response to treatment on the longevity of adults differed significantly between maize and Phacelia, with flower strips being intermediate, indicating interaction effects of PPP treatment and low pollen quality in maize compared to Phacelia and flowering strip treatments. Head weight of newly hatched worker bees showed significant interaction of nutritional status and treatment of PPPs. PPPs slightly increased body weight in all nutritional statuses, except for Phacelia. Enzyme activity of acetylcholinesterase and P450 reductase showed significant different responses between maize and Phacelia to PPP exposure, but not between maize and flowering strip.

For this purpose, tagged bees were exposed to DWV by feeding or injection, and/or to field-relevant doses of thiamethoxam, then left in colonies equipped with optical bee counters to monitor flight activity. DWV loads and the expression of immune genes were quantified. A reduction in vitellogenin expression level was observed in DWV-injected bees and was associated with precocious onset of foraging. Combined exposure to DWV and thiamethoxam did not result in higher DWV loads compared to bees only exposed to DWV, but induced precocious foraging, increased the risk of not returning to the hive after the first flight, and decreased survival when compared to single stress exposures.

Stressors also alter the activity of two other enzymes (carboxylesterase alpha [CaE Œ±] and carboxylesterase para [CaE p] in the midguts) involved in metabolic and detoxification functions. Furthermore, single and combined effects of pesticide and parasite decrease survivorship of queens introduced into mating hives for three months. Because colony demographic regulation relies on queen's fertility, the compromise of its physiology and life can seriously menace colony survival under pressure of combined stressors.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep31430,6.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986205318&doi=10.1038%2fsrep31430&partnerID=40&md5=a05cb370ceb04906c9a667f29d81f1f2,Scopus,,,,,,0,355,0,

The interaction between sublethal doses of a neurotoxin, clothianidin, and the ectoparasite, Varroa destructor, was examined by measuring differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in brains, deformed wing virus (DWV) and the proportion and intensity of self-grooming. Evidence for an interaction was observed between the stressors in a reduction in the proportion of intense groomers. Only the lowest dose of clothianidin alone reduced the proportion of self-groomers and increased DWV levels. V. destructor shared a higher proportion of DEGs with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin, indicating that the effects of V. destructor were more pervasive than those of clothianidin when they were combined. The number of up-regulated DEGs were reduced with the combined stressors compared to clothianidin alone, suggesting an interference with the impacts of clothianidin. Clothianidin and V. destructor affected DEGs from different biological pathways but shared impacts on pathways related to neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer‚Äôs, which could be related to neurological dysfunction and may explain their negative impacts on grooming. This study shows that the combination of clothianidin and V. destructor resulted in a complex and non-additive interaction. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",2019///,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-41365-0,9.0,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063458403&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-41365-0&partnerID=40&md5=457d7e9a9560b64425d987c432c2e9c2,Scopus,,,,,,0,356,0,

Foraging on the wOSR crop was confirmed by melissopalynology determination of the corbicular pollen collected periodically, while the chemical analysis showed that exposure to thiamethoxam was mainly through nectar. There was an increase in the accumulation of dead bees in the apiary exposed to thiamethoxam relating with the control, which was coped with an increment of bee brood surface and adult bee population.

Pesticides could cause honeybee abnormal development in response to neurotoxins such as neonicotinoid. However, knowledge of carbendazim, a widespread fungicide in beekeeping practice, influencing on honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) brain development is lacking. Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group. The data is the first report of neurotoxic effects on honeybee caused by carbendazim, and the sublethal carbendazim may disturb honeybee development and is a potential chemical threating the honeybee colonies. ¬© 2018 Wang, Fan, Ji, Zhang, Chen, Wang, Yin, Gao, Chen and Ji.",2018///,2018,10.3389/fgene.2018.00426,9.0,OCT,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055340918&doi=10.3389%2ffgene.2018.00426&partnerID=40&md5=2c94894cb0a64755b0611080d08a87da,Scopus,,,,,,0,361,0,

The decline in bee health is therefore a complex multifactorial problem which requires a holistic investigative approach. Within the exposome paradigm, the combined exposure to the environment, drugs, food, and individuals' internal biochemistry affects health in positive and negative ways. In the context of the exposome, honey bee hive infection with parasites such as Nosema ceranae is also a form of environmental exposure. In this study, we hypothesized that exposure to xenobiotic pesticides and other environmental chemicals increases susceptibility to N. ceranae infection upon incidental exposure to the parasite. We further queried whether these exposures could be linked to changes in conserved metabolic biological pathways. From 30 hives sampled across 10 sites, a total of 2,352 chemical features were found via gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF) in extracts of honey bees collected from each hive. Of these, 20 pesticides were identified and annotated, and found to be significantly associated with N. ceranae infection. We further determined that infected hives were linked to a greater number of xenobiotic exposures, and the relative concentration of the exposures were not linked to the presence of a N. ceranae infection. In the exposome profiles of the bees, we also found chemicals inherent to known biological metabolic pathways of Apis mellifera and identified 9 dysregulated pathways. These findings have led us to posit that for hives exposed to similar chemicals, those that incur multiple, simultaneous xenobiotic stressors have a greater incidence of infection with N. ceranae. Mechanistically, our results suggests the overwhelming nature of these exposures negatively affects the biological functioning of the bee, and could explain how the decline in bee populations is associated with pesticide exposures.",2019/03/07/,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0213249,14.0,3,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000460638800056,,,0,367,0,

Temperature affects the survival of honeybees, and determines the quality of their development, which is of great significance for beekeeping production. Yet, little was known about how does low temperature stress during development stage cause bee death and any sub-lethal effect on subsequent. Early pupal stage is the most sensitive stage to low temperature in pupal stage. In this study, early pupal broods were exposed to 20 degrees C for 12, 16, 24, and 48 h, followed by incubation at 35 degrees C until emergence. We found that 48 h of low temperature duration cause 70% of individual bees to die. Although the mortality at 12 and 16 h seems not very high, the association learning ability of the surviving individuals was greatly affected. The brain slices of honeybees showed that low temperature treatment could cause the brain development of honeybees to almost stop. Gene expression profiles between low temperature treatment groups (T24, T48) and the control revealed that 1,267 and 1,174 genes were differentially expressed respectively. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that the differential expression of Map3k9, Dhrs4, and Sod-2 genes on MAPK and peroxisome signaling pathway caused oxidative damage to the honeybee head. On the FoxO signal pathway, InsR and FoxO were upregulated, and JNK, Akt, and Bsk were downregulated; and on the insect hormone synthesis signal pathway, Phm and Spo genes were downregulated. Therefore, we speculate that low temperature stress affects hormone regulation. It was detected that the pathways related to the nervous system were Cholinergic synapse, Dopaminergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, Glutamatergic synapse, Serotonergic synapse, Neurotrophin signaling pathway, and Synaptic vesicle cycle.

Accumulating evidence suggests that these effects extend to the honeybee gut microbiome, which serves important functions for honeybee health. Here we test the potential effects of the pesticides thiacloprid, acetamiprid, and oxalic acid on the gut microbiota of honeybees, first in direct in vitro inhibition assays and secondly in an in vivo caged bee experiment to test if exposure leads to gut microbiota community changes. We found that thiacloprid did not inhibit the honeybee core gut bacteria in vitro, nor did it affect overall community composition or richness in vivo. Acetamiprid did also not inhibit bacterial growth in vitro, but it did affect community structure within bees. The eight bacterial genera tested showed variable levels of susceptibility to oxalic acid in vitro. In vivo, treatment with this pesticide reduced amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and affected gut microbiome composition, with most marked impact on the common crop bacteria Lactobacillus kunkeei and the genus Bombella. We conducted network analyses which captured known associations between bacterial members and illustrated the sensitivity of the microbiome to environmental stressors. Our findings point to risks of honeybee exposure to oxalic acid, which has been deemed safe for use in treatment against Varroa mites in honeybee colonies, and we advocate for more extensive assessment of the long-term effects that it may have on honeybee health. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2021 Cuesta-Mat√©, Renelies-Hamilton, Kryger, Jensen, Sinotte and Poulsen.",2021///,2021,10.3389/fmicb.2021.717990,12.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115175472&doi=10.3389%2ffmicb.2021.717990&partnerID=40&md5=fde26e390f69af1f4807fc473a7eadca,Scopus,"['neonicotinoid', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'honeybee', 'thiacloprid', 'in vitro study', 'microbiome', 'DNA extraction', 'intestine flora', 'Lactobacillus', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'social insect', 'acaricide', 'microbial community', 'in vivo study', 'amplicon', 'anthropogenic stressor', 'antibiotic resistance', 'antibiotic sensitivity', 'Bartonella', 'Bifidobacterium', 'insect society', 'microbial diversity', 'minimum inhibitory concentration', 'oxalic acid', 'RNA 16S', 'symbiosis']",,,,,0,369,0,

Colony development was evaluated by monitoring the colony mass, forager activity was assessed, both at the hive and within the crop, and the contribution of oilseed rape to the pollen stored within the colony was analysed. ResultsPollen collected from the treated crop contained residues of 1.0 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and 3.0 mu g CGA322704 (metabolite likely equivalent to clothiandin) kg(-1), and nectar contained residues of 1.8 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1) and no metabolite. No residues of thiamethoxam or CGA322704 were detected in samples from the control fields. Up to 93% of bumblebee collected pollen sampled from within the colonies originated from oilseed rape, and B. terrestris were observed actively foraging on all the fields. Colonies on all three fields showed similar rates of mass gain during the exposure phase and comparable production of gynes and drones.

Twelve honeybee colonies were used per treatment group, 4 each located at the field edge (on-field site), at approximately 500m and 1000m from the field. A total of nearly 300 newly emerged bees per colony were fitted (tagged) with Mic3 radio frequency identification (RFID) transponders and introduced into each of the 36 study hives. The RFID readers fitted to the entrances of the test colonies were used to monitor the activity of the tagged bees for the duration of the 5-wk flowering period of the crop. These activity data were analyzed to assess any impact on flight activity of bees foraging on the treated compared with untreated crops. Honeybees were seen to be actively foraging within all 3 treatment groups during the exposure period. The data for the more than 3000 RFID-tagged bees and more than 90000 foraging flights monitored throughout the exposure phase for the study follow the same trends across the treatment and controls and at each of the 3 apiary distances, indicating that there were no effects from foraging on the treated crop.

Both can affect honey bee physiology and microbial gut communities, eventually reducing its lifespan. They can also have a combined effect on the insect‚Äôs survival. The use of bacterial probiotics has been proposed to improve honey bee health, but their beneficial effect remains an open question. In the present study, western honey bees were experimentally infected with N. ceranae spores, chronically exposed to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam, and/or supplied daily with the homofermentative bacterium Pediococcus acidilactici MA18/5M thought to improve the honey bees‚Äô tolerance to the parasite. Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowed the response of the gut microbiota to be investigated with a taxonomic resolution at the species level. All treatments induced significant changes in honey bee gut bacterial communities. Nosema ceranae infection increased the abundance of Proteus mirabilis, Frischella perrara, and Gilliamella apicola and reduced the abundance of Bifidobacterium asteroides, Fructobacillus fructosus, and Lactobacillus spp. Supplementation with P. acidilactici overturned some of these alterations, bringing back the abundance of some altered species close to the relative abundance found in the controls. Surprisingly, the exposure to thiamethoxam also restored the relative abundance of some species modulated by N. ceranae.

Among these, neonicotinoid insecticides are of concern as they have been shown to be responsible for extensive honeybee colonies death when released into the environment. Also, sublethal neonicotinoid doses contaminating single honeybees and their colonies (e.g. through contaminated pollen) are responsible for honeybees physiological alterations with probable implication also on microbiome functionality. Honeybees show symbiotic interactions with specific gut bacteria that can enhance the adult host performances. Among the known mechanisms, the modulation of the immune system, the degradation of recalcitrant secondary plant metabolites, pollen digestion, and hormonal signaling, are the most important functional benefits for the host honeybee. To date, few research efforts have aimed at revealing the impact of PPP on the gut microbial community of managed and wild honeybees. The majority of the existing literature relays on cage or semifield tests of short duration for research investigating neonicotinoids-gut microbiome interactions. This research wanted to unravel the impact of two neonicotinoids (i.e. imidacloprid and thiacloprid) in natural field conditions up to 5 weeks of exposure. A long-term impact of neonicotinoids on gut microbial community of honeybees was observed. The alterations affected several microbial genera and species such as Frischella spp., lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, whose shifting is implicated in intestinal dysbiosis. Long-term impact leading to dysbiosis was detected in case of exposure to imidacloprid, whereas thiacloprid exposure stimulated temporary dysbiosis. Moreover, the microbial diversity was significantly reduced in neonicotinoid-treated groups. Overall, the reported results support a compromised functionality of the gut microbial community, that might reflect a lower efficiency in the ecosystemic functionality of honeybees. ¬© 2020",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144116,762.0,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85098732480&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2020.144116&partnerID=40&md5=462b323cd798437076931b01ccc30e27,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'organism colony', 'colony', 'priority journal', 'Pollen', 'thiacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'Thiacloprid', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'microbiome', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'metabolite', 'Metabolites', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'DNA extraction', 'high throughput sequencing', 'intestine flora', 'Lactobacillus', 'Microbiota', 'Plant protection products', 'agroecosystem', 'microbial community', 'Bifidobacterium', 'microbial diversity', 'symbiosis', 'dysbiosis', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'DNA', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'immunomodulation', 'Frischella', 'Hormonal signaling', 'Microbial communities', 'Microbial diversity', 'Natural field conditions', 'Plant metabolites', 'Symbiotic interaction']",,,,,0,373,0,

In social insects, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of reproductives, i.e. males and queens, and efficient collaborative brood care by workers. Therefore, interactive effects between malnutrition and environmental pollution on sperm and feeding glands (hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs)) would provide mechanisms for population declines, unless buffered against due to their fitness relevance. However, while negative effects for bumble bee colony fitness are known, the effects of malnutrition and insecticide exposure singly and in combination on individuals are poorly understood. Here we show, in a fully-crossed laboratory experiment, that malnutrition and insecticide exposure result in neutral or antagonistic interactions for spermatozoa and HPGs of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, suggesting strong selection to buffer key colony fitness components. No significant effects were observed for mortality and consumption, but significant negative effects were revealed for spermatozoa traits and HPGs. The combined effects on these parameters were not higher than the individual stressor effects, which indicates an antagonistic interaction between both. Despite the clear potential for additive effects, due to the individual stressors impairing muscle quality and neurological control, simultaneous malnutrition and insecticide exposure surprisingly did not reveal an increased impact compared to individual stressors, probably due to key fitness traits being resilient.

In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings.

Research carried out on honeybees indicates that application of pesticides has a significant impact on the core gut community, which ultimately leads to an increase in the growth of harmful pathogens. Disturbances caused by pesticides also affect the way bacterial members interact, which results in gut microbial dysbiosis. Administration of beneficial microbes has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating or preventing disease in honeybees. The objective of this study was to measure under in vivo conditions the ability of two bacterial strains (the Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea sp.) isolated from honeybee gut to improve survival and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in honeybees exposed to a sublethal clothianidin dose (0.1 ppb). Both gut bacterial strains were selected for their ability to degrade clothianidin in vitro regardless of their host-microbe interaction characteristics (e.g., beneficial, neutral, or harmful). To this end, we conducted cage trials on 4- to 6-day-old newly emerging honeybees. During microbial administration, we jointly monitored the taxonomic distribution and activity level of bacterial symbionts quantifying 16S rRNA transcripts. First, curative administration of the Pantoea sp. strain significantly improved the survival of clothianidin-exposed honeybees compared to sugar control bees (i.e., supplemented with sugar [1:1]). Second, curative administration of the Enterobacter sp. strain significantly mitigated the clothianidin-induced dysbiosis observed in the midgut structural network, but without improving survival.

At each site, three locations were directly adjacent to oilseed rape fields and three locations were situated 400 m away from the nearest oilseed rape field. Thus, 96 hives were exposed to fully flowering oilseed rape crops. Colony sizes and weights, the amount of honey harvested, and infection with parasites and diseases were monitored between April and September 2014. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen was determined in pollen and honey samples. After oilseed rape flowering, the hives were transferred to an extensive isolated area for post-exposure monitoring.

Here, we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two main landscape types for 6¬†weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterized and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.
