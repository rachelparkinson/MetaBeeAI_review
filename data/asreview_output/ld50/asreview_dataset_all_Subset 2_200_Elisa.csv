120,JOUR,Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 ï¿½ï¿½L for honeybees and to 2 ï¿½ï¿½L for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower fod mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 The Aut",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,1,,1,1

18,JOUR,Susceptibility of Megachile rotundata to insecticides used in wild blueberry production in Atlantic Canada,"['Gradish, A.E.', 'Scott-Dupree, C.D.', 'Cutler, G.C.']",Journal of Pest Science,"The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), is a valuable wild and managed pollinator of lowbush blueberry (syn. 'wild blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. ï¿½ï¿½ 2011 Springer-Ver",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133.0,140.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,0,,1,3

The mode of action study on neonicotinoids toward nAChR would present significant guidance on rational molecular design to further discover new insecticides. Four neonicotinoids including commercial agents imidacloprid and flupyradifurone, two previously synthesized compounds guadipyr and ethoxythiagua in our lab were docked into a putative model of aphid and honeybee nAChR, respectively, to explore the binding and selective mechanism of neonicotinoids in this study. The obtained results showed that a traditional H-bond interaction, as a dominating electrostatic driving force, always conferred the binding of four neonicotinoids not only to target aphid receptor but also to non-target honeybee one. Four neonicotinoids almost showed uniformly binding conformation into aphid receptor, namely, a vital electronegative nitro or butenolide group to be conserved to nestle in a non-selective beta subunit. The bioassay study on Aphis gossypii also confirmed to be their excellent insecticidal activity with a lower LC50 value of 0.028-3.2 mu g/mL. However, to non-target honeybee receptor, this special nitro or butenolide group of four neonicotinoids was no longer only binding to the non-selective beta subunit of receptor. Three among four neonicotinoids like flupyradifurone, guadipyr and ethoxythiagua as a case of low bee-toxicity reported in the previous study, were happened to display an exactly inverted binding orientation, namely, an unusual electronegative group captured another selective alpha subunit. However, this high bee-toxicity imidacloprid remained one conserved conformation into the non-selective beta subunit as that seen from aphid receptor. This unique molecular mechanism of selectively binding to honeybee receptor, particularly to different subunit, was proposed cautiously to be one of factor determined the distinctive bee-toxicity for four neonicotinoids. These findings on the diverse mode of action for neonicotinoids to target and non-target receptor would be helpful for on novel insecticides design with high bioactivity as well as good selectivity based on the structure of different insect nAChR.

In this study, we synthesized a series of structural analogues of IPPA08 by converting the pyridyl moiety of IPPA08 into phenyl groups, via facile double-Mannich condensation reactions between nitromethylene compounds and glutaraldehyde. All of the oxabridged neonicotinoid compounds were found to increase the toxicity of imidacloprid against Aphis craccivora. Notably, compound 25 at 0.75 mg/L lowered the LC50 value of imidacloprid against A. craccivora by 6.54-fold, while a 3.50-fold reduction of the LC50 value was observed for IPPA08.

Here, we describe a novel insecticide synergist with activity specific for insecticidal neonicotinoids. The synergist IPPA08, a cis configuration neonicotinoid compound with a unique oxabridged substructure, could increase the toxicity of most neonicotinoid insecticides belonging to the Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) 4A subgroup against a range of insect species, although IPPA08 itself was almost inactive to insects at synergistic concentrations. Unfortunately, similar effects were observed on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) and the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens), resistant to imidacloprid. IPPA08 did not show any effects on toxicity of insecticides with different targets, which made us define it as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist. Unlike most insecticide synergists, by inhibition of activities of detoxification enzymes, IPPA08 showed no effects on enzyme activities. The results revealed that IPPA08 worked as a synergist through a distinct way. Although the modulating insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs, targets of neonicotinoid insecticides) were supposed as a possible mode of action for IPPA08 as a neonicotinoid-specific synergist, direct evidence is needed in further studies. In insect pest control, IPPA08 acts as a target synergist to increase neonicotinoid toxicity and reduce the amount of neonicotinoid used. Combinations of IPPA08 and insecticidal neonicotinoids may be developed into new insecticide formulations. In summary, combining an active ingredient with a ""custom"" synergist appears to be a very promising approach for the development of effective new insecticide products.",2016/06/29/,2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.6b01512,64,25,0021-8561,WOS:000378984500002,5148.0,5155.0,,,,,0,,1,14

A new perspective was put forward to reduce the potential ecological toxicity of neonicotinoid dinotefuran to honeybee in terms of an enantiomeric level in the study. Toxicity of dinotefuran was enantioselective, and S-dinotefuran was 41.1- to 128.4-fold more toxic than R-dinotefuran to honeybee Apis mellifera (Apis mellifera Linnaeus), whereas R-dinotefuran exhibited comparative insecticidal activities (1.7ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2.4 times) to typical sucking pests Aphis gossypii and Apolygus lucorum compared to racemic mixtures. Our data suggested that use of R-dinotefuran could have a good efficacy in controlling target pests while minimizing hazard to honeybees. The mechanism for chiral specific toxicity to honeybee was further characterized by electrophysiological studies and molecular docking. S-dinotefuran appears to be more toxic by binding to ï¿½ï¿½8 subunit of nAChmellifera. The ï¿½ï¿½8 also have a more stable, functional binding cavity to S-dinotefuran with a higher binding score of 7.15, primarily due to an extensive hydrogen bond network. Therefore, new chiral products with a high proportion of or an enantiomeric pure R-dinotefuran are recommended to achieve effective pests control reducing hazard to honeybee populations. ï¿½ï¿½ 2019 The",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.envint.2019.05.048,130,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067030671&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2019.05.048&partnerID=40&md5=34ecfc9dc6470b6f2a0d591bc7f7df71,Scopus,,,0,,1,15

69,JOUR,Use of double-stranded RNA targeting ï¿½ï¿½2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit to control pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum at larval and adult st,"['Ligonniere, S', 'Raymond, V', 'Goven, D']",PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, the use of the RNA interference technology (RNAi) has emerged as one of the new strategies for species-specific control of insect pests. Its specificity depends on the distinctiveness of the target gene sequence for a given species. In this work, we assessed in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (A. pisum) the use of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that targets the beta 2 divergent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit (dsRNA-beta 2), which shares low sequence identity with other subunits, to control populations of this pest at different developmental stages. Because nAChRs are targeted by neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid, we also assessed the effect of dsRNA-beta 2 coupled to this insecticide on aphid survival. Finally, because the effect of a control agent on beneficial insect must be considered before any use of new pest management strategies, the acute toxicity of dsRNA-beta 2 combined with imidacloprid was evaluated on honeybee Apis mellifera.RESULTS: In this work, we demonstrated that dsRNA-beta 2 alone has an insecticidal effect on aphid larvae and adults. Moreover, dsRNA-beta 2 and imidacloprid effects on aphid larvae and adults were additive, meaning that dsRNA-beta 2 did not alter the efficacy of imidacloprid on these two developmental stages. Also, no obvious acute toxicity on Apis mellifera was reported.CONCLUSION: Using RNAi that targets beta 2 divergent nAChR subunit is effective alone or combined with imidacloprid to control A. pisum at larval and adult stages. Because no obvious Apis mellifera mortality has been reported, this RNAi-based pest management strategy should be considered to control insect pest. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Toxic baits consisted acetamiprid, ivermectin, chlorfenapyr, and fipronil, with residues of which on the filter paper adult bees contacted on plastic containers. It was found that the bait formulation with ivermectin manifested toxicity slower than the other ones. We used probit analysis to calculate median lethal doses (LD50) of each active substance showed that their toxicity to bees decreased in the following order: fipronil -ivermectin - chlorfenapyr - acetamiprid. Considering the mass content of active substances in formulations, median lethal doses of toxic baits were 202.6 mu g/bee (bait with fipronil), 229.3 mu g/bee (bait with ivermectin), 1188.3 mu g/bee (bait with chlorfenapyr), and 6552 mu g/bee (bait with acetamiprid). Thus, bait formulations themselves may be considered practically nontoxic to bees, since their LD50 exceeded the threshold value of 100 mu g/bee. Assessment of hazard degree for bees by the hazard index showed that the insecticide bait containing acetamiprid were less dangerous than the other three bait formulations under laboratory conditions.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½0.0006) ï¿½ï¿½g active ingredient (a.i.) beeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin,d abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effen syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 The Aut",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,0,,1,22

Neonicotinoids can harm nontargets, such as pollinators potentially exposed via floral resources of treated plants. We quantified neonicotinoid residues in whole flowers of two SLF host plant species, red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Sapindaceae]) and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) [Sapindales: Simaroubaceae]), treated with post-bloom imidacloprid or dinotefuran applications that differed in timing and method of application. In red maple flowers, dinotefuran residues from fall applications were significantly higher than summer applications, while imidacloprid residues from fall applications were significantly lower than summer applications. Residues did not differ between application methods or sites. In tree-of-heaven flowers, dinotefuran residues were only detected in one of 28 samples at a very low concentration. To assess acute mortality risk to bees from oral exposure to residues in these flowers, we calculated risk quotients (RQ) using mean and 95% prediction interval residue concentrations from treatments in this study and lethal concentrations obtained from acute oral bioassays for Apis mellifera (L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)), then compared these RQs to a level of concern. For A. mellifera, only one treatment group, applied at 2X maximum label rate, had an RQ that exceeded this level. However, several RQs for O. cornifrons exceeded the level of concern, suggesting potential acute risk to solitary bees.

Recent discovery of insecticidal activity of MB against insect pests provides a potential alternative to chemical insecticides. The aim of this study was to examine any potential adverse impact of MB on honey bees. By using two different methods, a spray for contact and feeding for oral toxicity, LC50s were 236.61 and 824.99 g a.i./L, respectively. The spray toxicity was 2002-fold and 173,163-fold lower than that of imidacloprid and abamectin. Piperonyl butoxide (PBO, inhibiting P450 oxidases [P450]) significantly synergized MB toxicity in honey bees, indicating P450s are the major MB-detoxification enzymes for bees. Assessing additive/synergistic interactions indicated that MB synergistically or additively aggravated the toxicity of all four insecticides (representing four different classes) in honey bees. Another adverse effect of MB in honey bees was the significant decrease of orientation and flight ability by approximately 53%. Other influences of MB included minor decrease of sucrose consumption, minor increase of P450 enzymatic activity, and little to no effect on esterase and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. By providing data from multiple experiments, we have substantially better understanding how important the P450s are in detoxifying MB in honey bees. MB could adversely affect feeding and flight in honey bees, and may interact with many conventional insecticides to aggravate toxicity to bees. However, MB is a relatively safe chemical to bees. Proper formulation and optimizing proportion of MB in mixtures may be achievable to enhance efficacy against pests and minimize adverse impact of MB on honey bees. ï¿½ï¿½ 2019 by the auth",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10110382,10,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074627857&doi=10.3390%2finsects10110382&partnerID=40&md5=1d7cd991c5dc71ff1cccacd749911b7f,Scopus,,,0,,1,29

The goal of this study was to investigate the prevalence of non-additive effects of pesticides to honey bees (Apis mellifera). We investigated a large set of mixtures including insecticides and fungicides of different chemical modes of action and classes. The mixtures included represent a relevant sample of pesticides that are currently used globally. We investigated whether the experimental toxicity of the mixtures could be predicted based on the Concentration Addition (CA) model for acute contact and oral adult bee toxicity tests. We measured the degree of deviation from the additivity predictions of the experimental toxicity based on the well-known Mixture Deviation Ratio (MDR). Further, we investigated the appropriate MDR thresholds that should be used for the identification of non-additive effects based on acceptable rates for false positive (alpha) and true positive (beta) findings. We found that a deviation factor of MDR = 5 is a sound reference for labeling potential non-additive effects in acute adult bee experimental designs when assuming a typical Coefficient of Variation (CV%) = 100 in the determination of the LD50 of a pesticide (a factor of 2ï¿½ï¿½ deviation in the LD 50 resulting from inter-experimental variability). We found that only 2.4 % and 9 % of the mixtures evaluated had an MDR > 5 and MDR < 0.2, respectively. The frequency and magnitude of deviation from additivity found for bees in this study are consistent with those of other terrestrial and aquatic taxa. Our findings suggest that additivity is a good baseline for predicting the toxicity of pesticide mixtures to bees, and that the rare cases of synergy of pesticide mixtures to bees are not random but have a mechanistic basis. ï¿½ï¿½ 2022 The",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159518,857,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85140783605&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.159518&partnerID=40&md5=6f800aae18835c979ed4c168161574ac,Scopus,"['acute toxicity', 'Acute toxicity', 'additive', 'Additive effects', 'Additives', 'additivity', 'Additivity', 'additivity effect', 'additivity predictions', 'adult', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'biological activity', 'clothianidin', 'coefficient of variation', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration addition', 'Concentration addition', 'concentration addition model', 'cyfluthrin', 'cyhalothrin', 'cypermethrin', 'deltamethrin', 'endosulfan', 'ethiprole', 'etofenprox', 'experimental cumulative distribution function', 'experimental design', 'experimental toxicity', 'exposure route', 'exposure time', 'fenpropidin', 'fipronil', 'fluoxastrobin', 'flupyradifurone', 'Food products', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Honey bee', 'honey bees', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'isoflucypram', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'methamidophos', 'methiocarb', 'mixture deviation ratio', 'mixtures', 'Mixtures', 'non additive effects', 'Non-additive', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'pesticides', 'Pesticides', 'physical parameters', 'prevalence', 'probability', 'prochloraz', 'prothioconazole', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'spiromesifen', 'spirotetramat', 'spiroxamine', 'synergistic effect', 'synergy', 'Synergy', 'tebuconazole', 'tetraniliprole', 'thiacloprid', 'thiodicarb', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'toxicological parameters', 'transfluthrin', 'triadimenol', 'unclassified drug']",,0,,1,30

The binding mode predicted for the two neonicotinoids is validated through the good agreement observed between the theoretical results with the crystal structures of the corresponding complexes with Ac-AChBP, the recognized structural surrogate for insects nAChR extracellular ligand binding domain. The binding site of the two insect alpha 6 receptors differs by only one residue of loop D, a serine residue (Ser83) in cockroach being replaced by a lysine residue (Lys108) in honeybee. The docking results show very close interactions for the two neonicotinoids with both alpha 6 nAChR models, in correspondence to the trends observed in the experimental neonicotinoid-Ac-AChBP complexes. However, the docking parameters (scores and energies) are not significantly different between the two insect alpha 6 nAChRs to draw clear conclusions. The MD results bring distinct trends. The analysis of the average interaction energies in the two insects alpha 6 nAChRs shows indeed better affinity of neonicotinoids bound to alpha 6 cockroach compared to honeybee nAChR. This preference is explained by tighter contacts with aromatic residues (Trp and Tyr) of the binding pocket. Interestingly, the non-conserved residue Lys108 of loop D of alpha 6 honeybee nAChR interacts through van der Waals contacts with neonicotinoids, which appear more favourable than the direct or water mediated hydrogen-bond interaction between the OH group of Ser83 of alpha 6 cockroach nAChR and the electronegative terminal group of the two neonicotinoids (nitro in IMI and cyano in THI). Finally, in both insects nAChRs, THI is consistently found to bind more favourably than IMI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

68,JOUR,Design of environmentally friendly neonicotinoid insecticides with bioconcentration tuning and Bi-directional selective toxic effects,"['Zhao, YY', 'Li, Y']",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"A 3D-QSAR model was established with CoMSIA to characterize neonicotinoid insecticides. LgBCF values were used as the dependent variable and the molecular structures of 30 compounds were used as the independent variable. This model was used to design neonicotinoid insecticides with reduced bioconcentration. The contour maps from the 3D-QSAR model were used to evaluate substituted sites and different substituents that significantly affected the bioconcentration of neonicotinoid insecticides. The CoMSIA model showed that neonicotinoid insecticide bioconcentration was strongly affected by steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields. Using compound 20 as a template, 105 new substituted derivatives with lower bioconcentrations (reduced by 21.34-77.21%) were designed. The toxicities of these derivatives were evaluated, which showed that 100 of the derivatives retained the original toxicity (increased by 0.10-5.67%). Next, a 2D-QSAR model showed that the decreased bioconcentration of the new neonicotinoid insecticides was mainly caused by the total energy and dipole moment. Homology modeling was used to obtain the genetic recombination AChR in sucking-type pests (i.e. aphid, leafhopper, thrips, and Bemisia tabaci) and bees (i.e. Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis cerana). The neonicotinoid insecticides before and after modification were docked with AChRs to complete the screening of derivatives with bi-directional selective toxic effects. LibDock scores showed that Derivative-5, Derivative-18, Derivative-31, and Derivative-65 had bi-directional selective effects on pests and bees. The effects of the Derivative-18 were the most significant, with toxicity increasing by 14.66% in pests and decreasing by 19.42% in bees. We determined via analysis of amino acid residues that Derivative-18 had more hydrophobic amino acids interacting with pest AChRs, and the mode of action was predominantly hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Derivative-18 had fewer hydrophobic amino acids interacting with bee AChRs, and the mode of action there was more reliant on van der Waals forces with weak binding power.

However, they affect severely some non-target insects, mainly honeybee in a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder (CCD). Results Effects of imidacloprid (IMI), most used neonicotinoids, on aphid acetylcholinesterase (AChE), in vivo and in vitro were examined; besides, molecular modeling was used to investigate similarities and differences of AChE and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors alpha 1-subunit (nAChR alpha 1) in aphids, target insect, and honeybees, non-target insect. Results showed that aphid AChE was inhibited in vitro, with IC50 108.6 mg/L but not affected in vivo while the mortality was concentration-dependent with high toxicity (LC50 9.50 mg/L); in addition, aphid AChE was more inhibited, in vitro, but with much less effects, in vivo, than that of honeybees. These results indicate that AChE is not the main cause of the observed mortality, but it still has a role in insect resistance system with different responses in both insects. Molecular modeling showed high similarity in primary and secondary structures of AChE indicated by high identity (67%) and low gaps (1%); besides, the same template for both enzymes was auto-selected for homology. In addition, similar positions of the triad amino acids were found in AChE of both insects indicating high similarity. Conversely, the similarity in nAChR alpha 1 in both insects is lower (50% identity and 9% gaps). These gaps (50 amino acids) are found in the intracellular large loop between TM3 and TM4 and account for the observed differences in the nAChR alpha 1 binding sites of in both insects. Conclusion These observed variations in nAChR alpha 1 structures and binding sites in different insect species can be used as good bases in designing new neonicotinoids that express high effects on target insects with better selectivity to minimize adverse effects on non-target organisms.",2024/08/29/,2024,10.1186/s40538-024-00644-3,11,1,2196-5641,WOS:001303583400003,,,,,"['AChE', 'Alfa subunit', 'Cowpea aphid', 'Honeybee', 'NAChR', 'Neonicotinoids']",,0,,0,42

Ecological risk assessment of single Plant Protection Products (PPPs) requires an understanding of the exposure and toxicity. In silico tools such as QSAR models can play a major role for the prediction of structural, physico-chemical and pharmacokinetic properties of chemicals as well as toxicity of single and multiple chemicals. Here, the first integrative honey bee QSAR model has been developed for PPPs using EFSA's OpenFoodTox, US-EPA ECOTOX and Pesticide Properties DataBase i) to predict acute contact toxicity (LD50) and ii) to profile the Mode of Action (MoA) of pesticides active substances. Three different classification-based and four regression-based models were developed and tested for their performance, thus identifying two models providing the most reliable predictions based on k-NN algorithm. The two-category QSAR model (toxic/non-toxic; n = 411) was validated using sensitivity (=0.93), specificity (=0.85), balanced accuracy (=0.90), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC = 0.78) as statistical parameters. The regression-based model (n = 113) was validated for its reliability and robustness (R-2 = 0.74; MAE = 0.52). Current study proposes the MoA profiling for 113 pesticides active substances and the first harmonised MoA classification scheme for acute contact toxicity in honey bees, including LD50s data points from three different databases. The classification allows to further define MoAs and the target site of PPPs active substances, thus enabling regulators and scientists to refine chemical grouping and toxicity extrapolations for single chemicals and component-based mixture risk assessment of multiple chemicals. Relevant future perspectives are briefly addressed to integrate MoA, adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and toxicokinetic information for the refinement of single-chemical/combined toxicity predictions and risk estimates at different levels of biological organization in the bee health context.",2020/09/15/,2020,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139243,735,,0048-9697,WOS:000542562100009,,,,,,,0,,0,45

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates. Our results support the hypothesis that the impact of GF-120 and malathion upon honey bees is minimal when applied at LDR and that computer simulation can help greatly in understanding the effects of pesticides upon nontarget species.",2016/04//,2016,10.1093/jee/tov385,109,2,0022-0493,WOS:000374497000004,515.0,519.0,,,,,0,,0,52

Here, multiple fluorescence spectra, thermodynamic method, and molecular docking were used to study the interaction and the functional inhibition of imidacloprid to the recombinant CSP1 protein in Asian honey bee, Apis cerana. The results showed that the fluorescence intensity (ï¿½ï¿½emï¿½ï¿½=ï¿½ï¿½332ï¿½ï¿½nm) of CSP1 could be significantly quenched by imidacloprid in a dynamic mode.

Synchronous fluorescence showed that the fluorescence of CSP1 was mainly derived from tryptophan, and the hydrophobicity of tryptophan decreased with the increase of imidacloprid concentration. Molecular docking predicted the optimal pose and the amino acid composition of the b dichroism (CD) spectra showed that imidacloprid reduced the ï¿½ï¿½-helix of CSP1 and caused the extension of the CSP1 peptide chain.

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU. Further studies are needed before proposing BPF incorporation into the honeybeesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ diet, but there already seem to be beneficial effects associated with its intake. ï¿½ï¿½ 2024 by th",2024///,2024,10.3390/ani14040608,14,4,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85187202591&doi=10.3390%2fani14040608&partnerID=40&md5=bee8613fa13ab09e8899b833165a5703,Scopus,"['animal health and welfare', 'aphid', 'Article', 'bergamot (Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau) bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF)', 'bergamot oil', 'colony forming unit', 'diet supplementation', 'Escherichia coli', 'flupyradifurone', 'food intake', 'honeybee', 'honeybee (Apis mellifera)', 'insecticide', 'intoxication', 'LC50', 'mass spectrometry', 'mortality rate', 'natural products', 'nonhuman', 'pilot study', 'poisoning', 'pollination', 'psyllid', 'Salmonella', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'ultra performance liquid chromatography', 'unclassified drug', 'whitefly']",,0,,0,55

Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure. Within the first day after application of FPF, mortality of bees feeding on buckwheat was 29 times higher compared with control treatments, while mortality of FPF exposed and control bees was similar in the other two plant species. Moreover, we found negative synergistic impacts of FPF and nutritional stress on offspring production, flight activity, flight duration and flower visitation frequency.

In this study, pesticide application patterns in wheat-maize rotation system, vegetable and apple producing areas, was studied by interviewing farmers in Quzhou County, the North China Plain. The pesticide use status was evaluated by the recommended and actual applied dose and risk quotient (RQ) based Bee-REX model was used to assess the exposure risks of pesticide to bees based on the collected pesticide application data. The results showed that over half (52 %) of farmers in selected sites misused pesticides and orchard owners were frequently misused pesticides. Positive correlations were found between pesticide usage performance and farmers' specialized training experience. Pesticides applied in orchards have caused higher exposure risks to bees with the mean of RQs exceed 120 and 1880 via acute contact and dietary routes, respectively. Pesticide misuse significantly elevates the exposure risk to bees that the mean RQ under misuse scenarios was 5.8 times than that of correct use.

In this study, sublethal (36 ng/bee) and median lethal (132 ng/bee) doses of imidacloprid were administered to bees. The results showed dose-dependent increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS), Fe2+, and mortality in bees. Notably, imidacloprid also induced upregulation of the gene encoding ferritin (AmFth), which plays a pivotal role in reducing Fe2+ overload. Upregulation of AmFth has been suggested to be closely related to ROS accumulation and high mortality in bees. To confirm the role played by AmFth in imidacloprid-activated ROS, dsAmFth double-strand was orally administered to bees after exposure to imidacloprid. The results revealed aggravated Fe2+ overload, higher ROS activation, and elevated mortality in the bees, indicating that imidacloprid activated ROS and caused mortality in the bees, probably by inducing iron overload.

[Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature.

In the present study, the effects of chronic FPF exposure on bees were systematically investigated at the individual behavioral, tissue, cell, enzyme activity, and the gene expression levels. Chronic exposure (14 d) to FPF led to reduced survival (12 mg/L), body weight gain (4 and 12 mg/L), and food utilization efficiency (4 and 12 mg/L). Additionally, FPF exposure (12 mg/L) impaired sucrose sensitivity and memory of bees. Morphological analysis revealed significant cellular and subcellular changes in brain neurons and midgut epithelial cells, including mitochondrial damage, nuclear disintegration, and apoptosis.

Public concerns over property damage, environmental impact and public health led to the immediate need and acceptability of alternative pesticide/bait combinations. Preliminary work with spinosad, a derivative of a soil microorganism developed by Dow AgroSciences, in combination with a new bait (SolBait) showed promise. To ensure that this product would be effective in Florida for fruit fly control, three field tests were conducted using aerial and/or foliar applications. Results indicated that sprays with spinosad-SolBait provided comparable and significant control levels for sterile Mediterranean and Caribbean fruit flies in comparison to standard malathion with NU-LUREï¿½ï¿½ or SolBait treatments by aerial or foliar application. In one test, honey bees and hives were exposed to sprays in the treatment area and no significant treatment differences were obed in hive condition or brood.

Firstly, the main insecticides for three stages of cotton growth were identified under the lateral mixing condition. Insecticides for the first phase included abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b), acetamiprid (N-(N-cyano-ethylimine)-N-methyl-2-chloropyridine-5-methylamine), dicofol (1,1-bis(p-Chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethanol) and cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester); the insecticides available in the second phase included cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), phoxim (O,O-diethyl-O-ï¿½ï¿½-cyanophine thiophosphate ester), deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester)-cyano-diphenyl ether) and abamectin (avermectin B1a and B1b). In third phase, cypermethrin ((RS)-ï¿½ï¿½-cyano-3-phenoxyebenzyl(SR)-3-(2,2-dichloroyl)-2,2-dimethyl cyclopropane carboxylic acid ester), and deltamethrin ((R,cis)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,2-dibromovinylcyclopropane ester) -cyano-diphenyl ether) were included. Different insecticide application schemes were designed according to whether the application cycle and sequence were considered. The molecular dynamics simulation method was used to determine the effects of different insecticide application schemes on pests and bees. After the simulation, the simplified mixed-weighted model carried out each application scheme. In the case of lateral mixing, the combination of avermectin + acetamiprid + trichlorobacitol + cypermethrin + phoxim + deltamethrin was selected as the optimal application program, which reduced bee toxicity by 98.77% and increased insect toxicby 55.84%. Whereas in the case of longitudinal residue, avermectin + cypermethrin + deltamethrin was selected. This combination reduced the harm to bees by 126.55% and increased the toxicity to target pests by 34.23%. Finally, by calculating the resultant force from different types of non-bonded forces, the mechanism of the effect of the optimal application scheme on bees and pests under two scenarios was analyzed. The optimally combined scheme prepared by screening could provide the bi-directional selectivity to bees and pests.

These stressors do not act in isolation, but interact, and may exacerbate one another. Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'.

81,JOUR,Neonicotinoid insecticide interact with honeybee odorant-binding protein: Implication for olfactory dysfunction,"['Li, HL', 'Wu, F', 'Zhao, L', 'Tan, J', 'Jiang, HT', 'Hu, FL']",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES,"The decline of bee population has caused great concern in recent years. A noticeable factor points to the neonicotinoid insecticides, which remain in the nectar and pollen of plants and impair the olfactory cognition of foraging bees. However, it remains elusive that if and how neonicotinoid insecticides interact with the olfactory system of bees. Herein, we studied the binding interaction between neonicotinoid imidacloprid and ASP2, one odorant-binding protein in eastern bees, Apis cerana, by multispectroscopic methods. The results indicate that imidacloprid significantly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of ASP2 as the static quenching mode, and expanded the conformation of ASP2 measured by the circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The acting force is mainly driven by hydrophobic force based on thermodynamic analysis. Docking analysis predicts a formation of a hydrogen bond, while the corresponding site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the hydrogen bond is not main force here. Moreover, imidacloprid with a sublethal dose (0.8 ng/bee) clearly decreased the binding affinity of ASP2 to a floral volatile, beta-ionone, which had been identified to strongly bind with the wild ASP2 before. This study may benefit to evaluate the effect of neonicotinoid insecticides on the olfactory cognitive behavior of bees involved in the crops pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) existing in the insect's olfactory system can recognize environmental semiochemicals. It was known that sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides could still cause a variety of physiological and behavioral abnormalities in bees. However, the molecular mechanism of A. cerana sensing and response for insecticide has not been further investigated. In this study, we found an A. cerana OBP17 gene significantly up-regulated expressed after exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid based on the transcriptomics results. The spatiotemporal expression profiles showed that OBP17 was highly expressed in the legs. Competitive fluorescence binding assays showed that OBP17 had the special and high binding affinity to imidacloprid among the 24 candidate semiochemicals, and the KA value of OBP17 binding with imidacloprid reached the maximum (6.94 ï¿½ï¿½ 104 L/mol) at low-temperature. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the quenching mechanism changed from dynamic to static binding interaction with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the force changed from hydrogen bond and van der Waals force to hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force, indicating the interaction exhibits variability and flexibility. Molecular docking showed that Phe107 contributed the most energy. RNA interference (RNAi) results showed that OBP17 knockdown significantly enhanced the electrophysiological response of the bees' forelegs to imidacloprid. Our study indicated that OBP17 could precisely touch and sense sublethal doses of neonicotinoid imidacloprid in the natural environment through its high expression in legs, and the upregulation expression of OBP17 exposure to imidacloprid probably implied that it participate in the detoxification processes of A. cerana.

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure. This new approach to measure risk is more accurate and could become a tool to aid the decision-making process in the risk assessment of pesticides. ï¿½ï¿½ 2014 Poquet et",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113728,9,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84913553440&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0113728&partnerID=40&md5=0bd734a30f96cf5929cbd058f27dc9d0,Scopus,,,0,,0,80

The beginning of the quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationship (QSAR/QSTR) field, after the 1960s, is related to the study of the organophosphorus pesticide activity. QSARs have been recognized as an important research direction in the field of medicinal, analytical chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical, and environmental chemistry. The main aim of QSAR/QSTR models is to find reliable relationships between the biological activity/toxicity and the experimental or theoretical compound molecular descriptors, to design new structures with improved target properties and safety profile. In this chapter, successful QSAR models are presented for the ecotoxicological data of organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides. In particular, QSAR models for organophosphorus aquatic and terrestrial organism ecotoxicity; for the neonicotinoid toxicity against the honeybees, Musca domestica L., American cockroach, and aphids (Aphis craccivora and Myzus persicae); and for the inhibition ability of acetylcholinesterase and other enzymes by organophosphorus pesticides are presented. The literature data indicate a large variety of QSAR approaches employed in these published studies. In case of organophosphorus pesticides, many available ecotoxicity data for human beings and animals were employed in the computational studies. For the neonicotinoid pesticides a limited number of QSAR models were reported, especially due to the lack of the degradability and aquatic organism toxicity data. The ligand-based combined with structure-based approaches remain a powerful tool in the design of new environment-friendly and less toxic organophosphorus and neonicotinoid pesticides.",2020///,2020,,,,1557-2153,WOS:000674448200022,513.0,544.0,,,,,0,,0,82

The research looked at the properties of the SDHA subunit of the enzyme Succinate dehydrogenase, which is important for energy production and mitochondrial function. The goal was to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of SDHA in several Apis bee species, as well as how pesticides can limit its activity. In silico analyses were conducted to understand the structural characteristics of the SDHA subunit, assess evolutionary conservation, analyze deformation energy, and investigate potential pesticide binding. Thirteen pesticides were subjected to molecular docking studies with the Apis SDHA subunit. The study revealed the stability and conserved nature of the SDHA subunit across different Apis sp. Deformation energy analysis highlighted regions of local flexibility, particularly in the active site and interdomain interfaces. Molecular docking analysis indicated that pesticides such as Carboxin, Clothianidin, and Dithianon potentially interfere with FAD binding, while Fipronil and Sulfoxaflor may disrupt both FAD and dicarboxylate binding.

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees. Our study emphasizes the impact of a nursery neonicotinoid formulation on solitary bee foraging and reproduction, while highlighting interactions between irrigation level and neonicotinoid application in containerized plants themselves.  ï¿½ï¿½ 2021 The Auth",2021///,2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.1287,288,1955,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112616684&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2021.1287&partnerID=40&md5=ccbc25face125461bdf205b87eb2db2f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Gardens', 'Hymenoptera', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'irrigation', 'land use', 'Megachile rotundata', 'Megachilidae', 'native species', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoids', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nursery ground', 'ornamental species', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Phacelia tanacetifolia', 'Plant Nectar', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'soil moisture']",,0,,0,86

This study focuses on the interactions between three neonicotinoid compounds and the honeybee's chemosensory protein 3 (CSP3), a key player in their olfactory system. Employing advanced spectroscopic techniques and molecular modeling, we explore the binding dynamics and conformational changes in CSP3 upon exposure to these pesticides. The research reveals that all three neonicotinoids considerably quench CSP3's fluorescence through a dynamic and static mixing mechanism, indicating a strong binding affinity, predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. UVï¿½ï¿½ï¿½visible absorption, synchronous fluorescence, and 3D fluorescence spectra support slight changes in the microenvironment around the aromatic amino acids of CSP3. Circular dichroism spectra indicate a reduction in CSP3's ï¿½ï¿½-helix content, suggesting structuralns.

Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality.

One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticidesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for upree days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day.

11,JOUR,FIPRONIL AND IMIDACLOPRID REDUCE HONEYBEE MITOCHONDRIAL ACTIVITY,"['Nicodemo, D', 'Maioli, MA', 'Medeiros, HCD', 'Guelfi, M', 'Balieira, KVB', 'De Jong, D', 'Mingatto, FE']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Bees have a crucial role in pollination; therefore, it is important to determine the causes of their recent decline. Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

Unfortunately, as many as 40% of crop pollinators are in a steep decline due to habitat loss and exposure to agrochemicals. Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40). Concurrent, colocated total suspended particulate matter samples contained multiple insecticides and parasiticides including pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones, in significantly higher concentrations downwind of feedyards (bifenthrin, 8.45 ï¿½ï¿½ 4.92; permethrin, 1032.34 ï¿½ï¿½ 740.76; clothianidin, 3.61 ï¿½ï¿½ 1.48; imidacloprid, 73.32 ï¿½ï¿½ 47.52; thiamethoxam, 5.81 ï¿½ï¿½ 3.16; abamectin, 0.45 ï¿½ï¿½ 0.29; ivermectin, 8.88 ï¿½ï¿½ 5.06 ng/g). Honeybees and mason bees sited downwind of feedyards always experienced higher mortality than those correspondingly sited upwind, and male mason bees experienced significantly higher mortality compared to females when both were sited downwind. Bees occurring downwind of beef cattle feedyards for 1 h are 232-260% more likely to die than those occurring upwind. Thus, agrochemicals used on and emitted from beef cattle feedyards are significant threats to bee pollinators. ï¿½ï¿½",2023///,2023,10.1021/acs.est.3c03135,57,40,,,14839.0,14848.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85172274460&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.3c03135&partnerID=40&md5=0b7afd64c1c6444b9f23500b2d0b73dd,Scopus,"['abamectin', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'agrochemicals', 'Agrochemicals', 'angiosperm', 'animal', 'animal pollination', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee pollinator', 'bee pollinators', 'Beef', 'beef cattle', 'Beef cattle feedyards', 'Bees', 'bifenthrin', 'bovine', 'Cattle', 'Cell proliferation', 'clothianidin', 'environmental exposure', 'Esters', 'feeding behavior', 'Feedyard', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee', 'honeybees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'insecticides', 'Insecticides', 'ivermectin', 'lactone', 'Lactones', 'Macrocyclic lactones', 'male', 'Male', 'Mason bee', 'mason bees', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Parasiticide', 'parasiticides', 'Particles (particulate matter)', 'particulate matter', 'Particulate Matter', 'permethrin', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'Pyrethroids', 'suspended particulate matter', 'thiamethoxam', 'toxicity']",,0,,0,95

One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. ï¿½ï¿½ 2023 The Aut",2023,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168103283&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166097&partnerID=40&md5=71fd9fafbe9b7749bcfa557154545900,,agriculture; Agriculture; animal experiment; animal parameters; animal tissue; anthropogenic effect; Anthropogenics; Apis; Article; Assessment procedure; bee; Bombus terrestris; Brood development; brood temperature; bumblebee; collective brood care; Collective thermoregulation; colony growth; Colony growth; controlled study; dietary exposure; flupyradifurone; glyphosate; herbicide; Herbicides; insecticide; Insecticides; Microcolonies; Mortality rate; nonhuman; organism colony; Parasite-; pesticide; Pesticides; Pollinator crisis; risk assessment; Risk assessment; Risks assessments; temperature; thermoregulation; unclassified drug,,0,,0,96

Results showed a significant decrease in bee longevity across all treatments compared to the control, with the combination of flupyradifurone, microplastics, and N. ceranae having the most severe impact. Microplastics and flupyradifurone exposure also increased N. ceranae proliferation, especially in bees subjected to both stressors.

9,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of clothianidin exposure of drones at sexual maturity stage, on antioxidant enzyme activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and on protein content of semen. Our results show for the first time that clothianidin elicits significant increases in superoxide dismutase, of glutathione peroxidase, of catalase and of MDA level.

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. ï¿½ï¿½ 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. ï¿½ï¿½ 2020 Elsevier ",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,0,,0,102

Bees were conditioned to visit a dispenser of sugar solution whilst a drilling machine was sowing corn along the flight path. Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed.

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals.

112,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/foodï¿½ï¿½ï¿½oral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not hostrogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey beesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. ï¿½ï¿½ 2023 by th",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,0,,0,107

We acquired 1-day-old, 20-day-old, and 2-year-old queens and 1-day-old and 20-day-old workers (foragers) fed 0, 5, or 200 ppb imidacloprid, a pesticide oxidative stressor. The activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase and the level of total antioxidant potential were determined in hemolymph. The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. ï¿½ï¿½ 2021 by the authors.

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

Exposure to multiple factors including pesticides like imidacloprid and amitraz may negatively alter their immune response and ultimately make them more susceptible to diseases. In this study, we compare the effect of different concentrations and mixtures of imidacloprid and amitraz with different concentrations of the immune stimulant, zymosan A.

In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination.

We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5ï¿½ï¿½mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10ï¿½ï¿½days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, ï¿½ï¿½-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut ï¿½ï¿½-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activixidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition.

We have tested (1) the interference of the pesticide flupyradifurone on male precopulatory behavior and male mating partner preferences, (2) the way that the pesticide interferes in male quality assessment by the female, and (3) the effects of the pesticide on the chemical compounds in the female cuticle. We exposed bees of both sexes to a sublethal concentration of flupyradifurone. Various behaviors were registered in a mating arena with two females (one unexposed and one exposed) and one male (either unexposed or exposed). Unexposed males were quicker to attempt to mate. Treatment also impacted precopulatory behavior and male quality assessment by females. Males approached unexposed females more quickly than insecticide-exposed ones. Females exposed to insecticide produced lower amounts of some cuticular hydrocarbons (sex pheromone candidates) and appeared less choosy than unexposed females.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449.0,461.0,,,,,0,,0,117

In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field.

We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming.

This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounr, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

All these biochemical side effects may lead to colony depopulation during future biotic/abiotic stress.",2020/08//,2020,10.1007/s13592-020-00747-4,51,4,0044-8435,WOS:000520675500001,620.0,630.0,,,"['acceleration', 'Apis mellifera', 'biochemistry', 'biomarker', 'cuticle', 'DNA', 'DNA methylation', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'inhibition', 'inhibitor', 'methylation', 'phosphatase', 'proteolysis', 'senescence', 'thiol']",,0,,0,121
