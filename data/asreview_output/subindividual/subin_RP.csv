4,JOUR,Sublethal exposure to thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin affects the midgut and Malpighian tubules of the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini),"['da Silva, J.A.', 'Farder-Gomes, C.F.', 'Barchuk, A.R.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Ecotoxicology,"The stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia Lepeletier 1836 (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is an essential pollinator in natural and agricultural ecosystems in the Neotropical region. However, these bees may be exposed to pesticides during foraging, which can affect both individuals and their colonies. One example comes from the use of pyraclostrobin (a fungicide) and thiamethoxam (an insecticide) for pest control in pepper crops, which F. varia visits. This study aimed to evaluate the isolated and combined sublethal effects of thiamethoxam (TMX) (0.000543 ng a.i./¬µL) and pyraclostrobin (PYR) (1.5 ng i.a./¬µL) on the morphology of the midgut and Malpighian tubules of F. varia workers. Results showed that both pesticides, regardless of the exposure time (through feeding during 48 h or 96 h), disturbed the morphology of the analyzed organs. Specifically, F. varia exposed orally to sublethal concentrations of thiamethoxam and pyraclostrobin, either alone or in combination, exhibited a higher rate of damage to the midgut (e.g., vacuolization, apocrine secretion, and cellular elimination) compared to the bees in the control groups, both after 48 h and 96 h of exposure. In Malpighian tubules, vacuolation is the only damage present. As the observed morphological alterations likely compromise the excretion and absorption functions, exposure to pyraclostrobin and thiamethoxam may lead to disturbances at both the individual and colony levels. These results highlight the urgent need for a future reassessment of the safety of fungicides and insecticides regarding their potential effects on bee populations. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02786-4,33,8,875,883,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198358059&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-024-02786-4&partnerID=40&md5=ff6ad40cd9da9997ffce27d0367ee700,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'thiamethoxam', 'Neonicotinoid', 'stingless bee', 'worker (insect)', 'feeding', 'Thiamethoxam', 'sublethal concentration', 'unclassified drug', 'animal tissue', 'midgut', 'fungicide', 'morphology', 'pyrachlostrobin', 'pyraclostrobin', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'cell vacuole', 'agricultural ecosystem', 'absorption', 'time', 'Morphological damages', 'Neotropical bees', 'Pesticides mixtures', 'Strobirulin', 'Worker bee', 'Malpighian tubule', 'excretion', 'apocrine gland', 'digestive system disease', 'Frieseomelitta varia', 'Malpighian Tubules', 'neotropical bee', 'strobirulin']",,,,1,,1,1
5,JOUR,Cytotoxic effects of thiamethoxam in the midgut and malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae),"['Catae, A.F.', 'Roat, T.C.', 'De Oliveira, R.A.', 'Ferreira Nocelli, R.C.', 'Malaspina, O.']",Microscopy Research and Technique,"Due to its expansion, agriculture has become increasingly dependent on the use of pesticides. However, the indiscriminate use of insecticides has had additional effects on the environment. These products have a broad spectrum of action, and therefore the insecticide affects not only the pests but also non-target insects such as bees, which are important pollinators of agricultural crops and natural environments. Among the most used pesticides, the neonicotinoids are particularly harmful. One of the neonicotinoids of specific concern is thiamethoxam, which is used on a wide variety of crops and is toxic to bees. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effects of this insecticide in the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of Africanized Apis mellifera. Newly emerged workers were exposed until 8 days to a diet containing a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 of LC50 (0.0428 ng a.i./l L of diet). The bees were dissected and the organs were processed for transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that thiamethoxam is cytotoxic to midgut and Malpighian tubules. In the midgut, the damage was more evident in bees exposed to the insecticide on the first day. On the eighth day, the cells were ultrastructurally intact suggesting a recovery of this organ. The Malpighian tubules showed pronounced alterations on the eighth day of exposure of bees to the insecticide. This study demonstrates that the continuous exposure to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam can impair organs that are used during the metabolism of the insecticide. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/jemt.22339,77,4,274,281,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896317005&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22339&partnerID=40&md5=52d578be248c256349e4f0308aa95ff2,Scopus,,,,,1,,1,2

The active ingredient imidacloprid has action on the nervous system of the insects. However, little has been studied about the actions of the insecticide on nontarget organs of insects, such as the Malpighian tubules that make up the excretory and osmoregulatory system. Hence, in this study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid in Malpighian tubules of Africanized Apis mellifera. In the tubules of treated bees, we found an increase in the number of cells with picnotic nuclei, the lost of part of the cell into the lumen, and a homogenization of coloring cytoplasm. Furthermore, we observed the presence of cytoplasmic vacuolization. We confirmed the increased occurrence of picnotic nuclei by using the Feulgan reaction, which showed the chromatin compaction was more intense in the tubules of bees exposed to the insecticide. We observed an intensification of the staining of the nucleus with Xylidine Ponceau, further verifying the cytoplasmic negative regions that may indicate autophagic activity. Additionally, immunocytochemistry experiments showed TUNEL positive nuclei in exposed bees, implicating increased cell apoptosis after chronic imidacloprid exposure. In conclusion, our results indicate that very low concentrations of imidacloprid lead to cytotoxic activity in the Malpighian tubules of exposed bees at all tested times for exposure and imply that this insecticide can alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2013///,2013,10.1002/jemt.22199,76,5,552,558,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875932526&doi=10.1002%2fjemt.22199&partnerID=40&md5=095fa40511ee3488e63a065d4d6c8361,Scopus,,,,,1,,1,3
390,JOUR,Field rates of Sivanto‚Ñ¢ (flupyradifurone) and Transform¬Æ (sulfoxaflor) increase oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in honey bees (Apis mellifera L.),"['Chakrabarti, P.', 'Carlson, E.A.', 'Lucas, H.M.', 'Melathopoulos, A.P.', 'Sagili, R.R.']",PLoS ONE,"Pesticide exposures can have detrimental impacts on bee pollinators, ranging from immediate mortality to sub-lethal impacts. Flupyradifurone is the active ingredient in Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and sulfoxaflor is the active ingredient in Transform¬Æ. They are both relatively new insecticides developed with an intent to reduce negative effects on bees, when applied to bee-attractive crops. With the growing concern regarding pollinator health and pollinator declines, it is important to have a better understanding of any potential negative impacts, especially sublethal, of these pesticides on bees. This study reports novel findings regarding physiological stress experienced by bees exposed to field application rates of these two insecticides via a Potter Tower sprayer. Two contact exposure experiments were conducted‚Äîa shorter 6-hour study and a longer 10-day study. Honey bee mortality, sugar syrup and water consumption, and physiological responses (oxidative stress and apoptotic protein assays) were assessed in bees exposed to Sivanto‚Ñ¢ and Transform¬Æ, and compared to bees in control group. For the longer, 10-day contact exposure experiment, only the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ group was compared to the control group, as high mortality recorded in the sulfoxaflor treatment group during the shorter contact exposure experiment, made the latter group unfeasible to test in the longer 10-days experiment. In both the studies, sugar syrup and water consumptions were significantly different between treatment groups and controls. The highest mortality was observed in Transform¬Æ exposed bees, followed by the Sivanto‚Ñ¢ exposed bees. Estimates of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species indicated significantly elevated oxidative stress in both pesticide treatment groups, when compared to controls. Caspase-3 protein assays, an indicator of onset of apoptosis, was also significantly higher in the pesticide treatment groups. These differences were largely driven by post exposure duration, indicating sublethal impacts. Further, our findings also emphasize the need to revisit contact exposure impacts of Sivanto‚Ñ¢, given the sub-lethal impacts and mortality observed in our long-term (10-day) contact exposure experiment. ¬© 2020 Chakrabarti et al.

Understanding the effect of pesticides on nurse bees is important because the fitness of nurse bees is critical for in-hive activities, such as larval survival and performing hive maintenance. In order to evaluate the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone on nurse bees, flupyradifurone at five different concentrations was selected to feed both larvae and nurse bees. Our results showed that nurse bees were more sensitive to flupyradifurone than larvae (LD50 of the acute oral toxicity of flupyradifurone was 17.72 mu g a.i./larva and 3.368 mu g a.i./nurse bee). In addition, the apoptotic rates of neurons in mushroom bodies of nurse bees were significantly induced by flupyradifurone at sublethal concentrations (8 mg/L, 20 mg/L, and 50 mg/L) and the median lethal concentration LC50 (125 mg/L). The expression of immune-related genes (Hsp90, Toll-8/Tollo, and defensin) was significantly changed in exposed nurse bees at the field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone. However, three detoxifying enzyme genes (CYP9Q1, -2, and -3) were not affected by pesticide exposure. Our data suggest that although flupyradifurone had a relatively lower acute oral toxicity than many other common pesticides, exposures to the field-realistic and other sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone still have cytotoxicity and immune-responsive effects on nurse bees. Therefore, flupyradifurone should be considered for its application in crops.",2023/03/28/,2023,10.3389/fphys.2023.1150340,14,,,,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000967662800001,,1,,1,5
295,JOUR,Interaction between Thiamethoxam and Deformed Wing Virus Type A on Wing Characteristics and Expression of Immune and Apoptosis Genes in Apis mellifera,"['Phokasem, P.', 'Mookhploy, W.', 'Krongdang, S.', 'Sinpoo, C.', 'Chantawannakul, P.']",Insects,"Honey bees are economically important insects for crop pollination. They play a significant role as pollinators of wild plants and agricultural crops and produce economical products, such as honey, royal jelly, wax, pollen, propolis, and venom. Despite their ecological and economical importance, the global honey bee population is in decline due to factors including pathogens, parasites, intensive agriculture, and pesticides. Moreover, these factors may be interlinked and exacerbate the loss of honey bees. This study aimed to investigate the interaction between a pesticide, thiamethoxam, and deformed wing virus type A (DWV-A) to honey bees and the effects on survival rate, wing characteristics, and expression of immune and apoptosis genes in Apis mellifera. We described the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A on honey bee wing characteristics, DWV-A loads, and the expressions of immune (defensin, abaecin, and hymenoptaecin) and apoptosis genes (buffy, apaf1, caspase3-like, caspase8-like, and caspase9-like). Honey bee larvae were fed with three different thiamethoxam doses (0.001, 1.4, and 14.3 ng/¬µL of the diet). Then, thiamethoxam-treated white-eyed pupae were injected with 107 copy numbers/honey bee of the DWV-A genome. The interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A caused a high mortality rate, crippled wings in newly emerged adult honey bees (100%), and resulted in induced expression of hymenoptaecin gene compared to the control group, while downregulation of caspase8-like, caspase9-like genes compared to the DWV injection group. Therefore, the potential interaction between thiamethoxam and DWV-A might have a deleterious effect on honey bee lifespan. The results from this study could be used as a tool to combat DWV-A infection and mitigate pesticide usage to alleviate the decrease in the honey bee population. ¬© 2022 by the authors.

This study evaluated the side effects of imidacloprid in the midgut of A. mellifera after acute oral exposure. Toxicity, histopathology, cytotoxicity, and expression of autophagy-related gene atg1 were evaluated in honey bee workers orally exposed to imidacloprid. The estimated imidacloprid LC50 was 1.44 mg L‚àí1. The midgut epithelium of bees fed on imidacloprid LC50 has the occurrence of cytoplasm vacuoles, enlarged intercellular spaces, disorganization of the striated border, and nuclear pyknosis, with an organ injury index that increases with time exposure. The midgut digestive cells of treated bees have apical protrusions, damaged mitochondria, and autophagosomes that were characterized for content with organelle debris and high expression of atg1.

Numerous factors appear to cause these declines including parasites, pathogens, malnutrition and pesticides. Residues of the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, widely used to combat Varroa mites and for crop protection in agriculture, respectively, have been detected in wax, pollen and comb samples. Here, we assess the effects of these compounds at different doses on the viability of sperm stored in the honey bee queens' spermatheca. Our results demonstrate that sub-lethal doses of imidacloprid (0.02 ppm) decreased sperm viability by 50%, 7 days after treatment. Sperm viability was a downward trend (about 33%) in queens treated with high doses of coumaphos (100 ppm), but there was not significant difference. The expression of genes that are involved in development, immune responses and detoxification in honey bee queens and workers exposed to chemicals was measured by qPCR analysis. The data showed that expression levels of specific genes were triggered 1 day after treatment. The expression levels of P450 subfamily genes, CYP306A1, CYP4G11 and CYP6AS14 were decreased in honey bee queens treated with low doses of coumaphos (5 ppm) and imidacloprid (0.02 ppm). Moreover, these two compounds suppressed the expression of genes related to antioxidation, immunity and development in queens at day 1. Up-regulation of antioxidants by these compounds in worker bees was observed at day 1. Coumaphos also caused a repression of CYP306A1 and CYP4G11 in workers. Antioxidants appear to prevent chemical damage to honey bees. We also found that DWV replication increased in workers treated with imidacloprid. This research clearly demonstrates that chemical exposure can affect sperm viability in queen honey bees. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.03.004,89,,1,8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960857417&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2016.03.004&partnerID=40&md5=33b4203b1a0bd361e5b24a1bfbf0fc22,Scopus,,,,,1,,1,9

Additionally, its cytotoxic effects on the digestive cells of midgut, Malpighian tubules cells and Kenyon cells of the brain of newly emerged A. mellifera bees were analyzed. The results showed that larval exposure to this concentration of thiamethoxam did not influence larval and pupal survival or the percentage of adult bee emergence.

The digestive cell of bees that were exposed to the insecticide exhibited a basal labyrinth without long and thin channels and compromised mitochondria. In Malpighian tubules cells, disorganized basal labyrinth, dilated mitochondria with a deformed shape and a loss of cristae, and disorganized microvilli were observed. The results showed that the exposed bees presented Kenyon cells with alterations in the nucleus and mitochondria.

Therefore, the sublethal effects of the insecticide thiamethoxam on the survival and morphological parameters of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris were investigated in the present study. Cells from both non-target organs (Malpighian tubules and midgut) and target organs (brain) were analyzed for morphological alterations using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The findings showed that when M. scutellaris foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100 = 0.000543 ng a. i./ŒºL), longevity was not reduced but brain function was affected, even with the non-target organs attempting to detoxify. The cellular damage in all the organs was mostly reflected in irregular nuclei shape and condensed chromatin, indicating cell death. The most frequent impairments in the Malpighian tubules were loss of microvilli, disorganization of the basal labyrinth, and cytoplasmic loss. These characteristics are related to an attempt by the cells to increase the excretion process, probably because of the high number of toxic molecules that reach the Malpighian tubules and need to be secreted. In general, damages that compromise the absorption of nutrients, excretion, memory, and learning processes, which are essential for the survival of M. scutellaris, were found.

Regarding the honey bees, beekeepers can be hampered by decreased production of honey and other bee products. Although the effects of insecticides on bees are widely studied for obvious reasons, there is growing evidence that fungicides, too, are not harmless to bees. However, further studies are needed on the effects caused by fungicide residues present in pollen and nectar which are collected and consumed by honey bees. For this reason, we aimed to perform a histopathological diagnosis and cell death immunolabeling in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of Africanized honey bee workers throughout continuous oral exposure (24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h) to low concentrations of picoxystrobin (9 ppb and 18 ppb), a strobilurin fungicide. Although there were no histopathological effects on the Malpighian tubules, an organ that plays a role in excretion, these effects were observed in the midgut of bees exposed to both concentrations of picoxystrobin.

The bioinsecticide spinosad was initially recognized as safe for non-target organisms; however, its toxicity has been changing this view. Here, we investigated the survival, behavioral changes, and structural changes in the midgut and Malpighian tubules of A. mellifera treated orally with a spinosad formulation. RESULTSThe field-recommended concentration of spinosad killed 100% of the bees. The 5% and 50% lethal concentrations (LC5 and LC50, respectively) of spinosad altered the behavioral activity, reducing the walking distance and velocity, and increased the resting time in comparison to the control. The LC50 caused disorganization of the epithelia of tested organs and induced oxidative stress and cell death. CONCLUSIONSThe present work provides new insights into the debate about the role of bioinsecticides in the mortality of Africanized honey bees. Even at very low concentrations, the spinosad formulation was toxic to the vital organs midgut and Malpighian tubules and adversely affected walking behavior. This detailed evaluation of the impact of the bioinsecticide on A. mellifera will contribute to the clarification of disturbances probably caused by spinosad formulations, which can be used to develop more sustainable protocols in agriculture.

In Brazil, one of the most widely used insecticides is imidacloprid, which targets the nervous system of insects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the brain of the Africanized Apis mellifera. The organs of both control bees and bees exposed to insecticide were subjected to morphological, histochemical and immunocytochemical analysis after exposure to imidacloprid, respectively, for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. In mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 and in optic lobes of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD 50/10, LD50/100, and LD50/50, we observed the presence of condensed cells. The Feulgen reaction revealed the presence of some cells with pyknotic nuclei, whereas Xylidine Ponceau stain revealed strongly stained cells. These characteristics can indicate the occurrence of cell death. Furthermore, cells in mushroom bodies of bees exposed to imidacloprid concentrations of LD50/10 appeared to be swollen. Cell death was confirmed by immunocytochemical technique. Therefore, it was concluded that sublethal doses of imidacloprid have cytotoxic effects on exposed bee brains and that optic lobes are more sensitive to the insecticide than other regions of the brain. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2013///,2013,10.1007/s00244-013-9897-1,65,2,234,243,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880324906&doi=10.1007%2fs00244-013-9897-1&partnerID=40&md5=21b9151258751d044482545e9fc87ac8,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,14

Thus, the goal of this work was assess the toxic effects of thiamethoxam on newly emerged worker bees of Apis mellifera (africanized honeybee-AHB). Initially, we determined that the lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of thiamethoxam was 4.28 ng a.i./ŒºL of diet. To determine the lethal time 50 (LT50), a survival assay was conducted using diets containing sublethal doses of thiamethoxam equal to 1/10 and 1/100 of the LC50. The group of bees exposed to 1/10 of the LC50 had a 41.2% reduction of lifespan. When AHB samples were analyzed by morphological technique we found the presence of condensed cells in the mushroom bodies and optical lobes in exposed honeybees. Through Xylidine Ponceau technique, we found cells which stained more intensely in groups exposed to thiamethoxam. The digestive and regenerative cells of the midgut from exposed bees also showed morphological and histochemical alterations, like cytoplasm vacuolization, increased apocrine secretion and increased cell elimination. Thus, intoxication with a sublethal doses of thiamethoxam can cause impairment in the brain and midgut of AHB and contribute to the honeybee lifespan reduction. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1002/tox.21842,29,10,1122,1133,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907866418&doi=10.1002%2ftox.21842&partnerID=40&md5=2b4d0e79e6f63b124c5e0f94b208277d,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,15

Imidacloprid is a widely used neonicotinoid; thus, we have highlighted the importance of assessing its oral toxicity to Africanized bees and used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the sublethal effects in the brain, the target organ, and the midgut, responsible for the digestion/absorption of food. In addition, the distribution of proteins involved in important biological processes in the brain were evaluated on the 1st day of exposure by MALDI-imaging analysis. Bioassays were performed to determine the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid to bees, and the value obtained was 1.4651 ng imidacloprid/mu L diet. Based on this result, the sublethal concentration to be administered at 1, 4 and 8 days was established as a hundredth (1/100) of the LC50. The results obtained from the ultrastructural analysis showed alterations in the midgut cells of bees as nuclear and mitochondrial damage and an increase of vacuoles. The insecticide caused spacing among the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies, chromatin condensation and loss of mitochondrial cristae. The MALDI-imaging analysis showed an increase in the expression of such proteins as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, amyloid protein precursor and protein kinase C, which are related to oxygen supply, neuronal degeneration and memory/learning, and a decrease in the expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 1, which is fundamental to the synapses. These alterations demonstrated that imidacloprid could compromise the viability of the midgut epithelium, as well as inhibiting important cognitive processes in individuals, and may be reflected in losses of the colony.",2018/03//,2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1874-4,27,2,109,121,,,,0963-9292,WOS:000425758800002,,0,,1,16

We investigated the effects of oral exposure to a realistic field concentration (20.5 ng g‚àí1) of imidacloprid on the midgut and fat body of Apis mellifera worker larvae. Our results showed that larvae exposed to imidacloprid exhibited changes in the midgut epithelium, including disorganization of the brush border, nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasm vacuolization, and release of cell fragments indication cell death. Additionally, histochemical analysis revealed that the midgut brush border glycocalyx was disorganized in exposed larvae. The fat body cells of imidacloprid-exposed larvae had a decrease in the size of lipid droplets from 50 to 8 Œºm and increase of 100 % of protein content, suggesting possible responses to the stress caused by the insecticide. However, the expression of de cdc20 gene, which plays a role in cell proliferation, was not affected in the midgut and fat body of treated larvae.

Although stingless bees, (e.g.: Melipona scutellaris), are more diverse than honeybees and they stand out in the pollination of several valuable economical crops, toxicity assessments with stingless bees are still scarce. Nowadays new approaches in ecotoxicological studies, such as omic analysis, were pointed out as a strategy to reveal mechanisms of how bees deal with these stressors. To date, no molecular techniques have been applied for the evaluation of target and/or non-target organs in stingless bees, such as the Malpighian tubules (Mt). Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Mt of M. scutellaris after one and eight days of exposure to LC50/100 (0.000543 ng a.i./ŒºL) of thiamethoxam (TMX). Through functional annotation analysis of four transcriptome libraries, the time course line approach revealed 237 DEGs (nine clusters) associated with carbon/energy metabolism and cellular processes (lysosomes, autophagy, and glycan degradation). The expression profiles of Mt were altered by TMX in processes, such as detoxification, excretion, tissue regeneration, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and DNA repair. Transcriptome analysis showed that cell metabolism in Mt was mainly affected after 8 days of exposure. Nine genes were selected from different clusters and validated by RT-qPCR. According to our findings, TMX promotes several types of damage in Mt cells at the molecular level.

The main objective of the present study was to evaluate comparatively the health of Carniolan and Africanized honey bees (AHB) co-exposed to thiamethoxam and Nosema ceranae (N. ceranae) spores. Newly-emerged worker honey bees were exposed solely with different sublethal doses of thiamethoxam (2% and 0.2% of LD50 for AHB), which could be consumed by bees under field conditions. Toxicity tests for the Carniolan bees were performed, and the LD50 of thiamethoxam for Carniolan honey bees was 7.86 ng bee-1. Immunohistological analyses were also performed to detect cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and/or N. ceranae treated bees. Thiamethoxam exposure had no negative impact on Nosema development in experimental conditions, but it clearly inhibited cell death in the midgut of thiamethoxam and Nosema-exposed bees, as demonstrated by immunohistochemical data. Indeed, thiamethoxam exposure only had a minor synergistic toxic effect on midgut tissue when applied as a low dose simultaneously with N. ceranae to AHB and Carniolan honey bees, in comparison with the effect caused by both stressors separately. Our data provides insights into the effects of the neonicotenoid thiamethoxam on the AHB and Carniolan honey bee life span, as well as the effects of simultaneous application of thiamethoxam and N. ceranae spores to honey bees. ¬© 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.12.030,147,,328,336,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84957799809&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2015.12.030&partnerID=40&md5=6d713555218035c2b5a1ca0720e7ee43,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,25
65,JOUR,Brain transcriptome of honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibiting impaired olfactory learning induced by a sublethal dose of imidacloprid,"['Li, Z.', 'Yu, T.', 'Chen, Y.', 'Heerman, M.', 'He, J.', 'Huang, J.', 'Nie, H.', 'Su, S.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Declines in honey bee populations represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has been one of the factors linked to these declines. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, has been reported to cause olfactory learning deficits in honey bees via impairment of the target organ, the brain. In the present study, olfactory learning of honey bees was compared between controls and imidacloprid-treated bees. The brains of imidacloprid-treated and control bees were used for comparative transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq to elucidate the effects of imidacloprid on honey bee learning capacity. The results showed that the learning performance of imidacloprid-treated bees was significantly impaired in comparison with control bees after chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid (0.02 ng/Œºl) for 11 days. Gene expression profiles between imidacloprid treatment and the control revealed that 131 genes were differentially expressed, of which 130 were downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees. Validation of the RNA-Seq data using qRT-PCR showed that the results of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq exhibited a high level of agreement. Gene ontology annotation indicated that the oxidation-reduction imbalance might exist in the brain of honey bees due to oxidative stress induced by imidacloprid exposure. KEGG and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that transient receptor potential and Arrestin 2 in the phototransduction pathway were significantly downregulated in imidacloprid-treated bees, and that five downregulated genes have causal effects on behavioral response inhibition in imidacloprid-treated bees. Our results suggest that downregulation of brain genes involved in immune, detoxification and chemosensory responses may result in decreased olfactory learning capabilities in imidacloprid-treated bees. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.02.001,156,,36,43,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061441396&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.02.001&partnerID=40&md5=27060647642889ad6ee1c69f9f3627d9,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,26

The development and strength of honey bee colonies depend on the reproductive success of queen bees. Because flowers are sources of food for bees, foragers can accidentally collect and carry contaminated pollen and nectar to their hives; and this may compromise the longevity and the life span of individuals. Thus, the present study aimed to observe the action of imidacloprid in the midgut and ovaries of Apis mellifera queens, as well as the effects on sperm stored in their spermatheca. To this end, the apiary was divided into three experimental groups: control, commercial imidacloprid, and active ingredient imidacloprid. For toxicity assays, a sucrose solution containing 1 ¬µg/L of imidacloprid was offered to the colonies for 42 days. A control group received only food in the same period. In both treatments with imidacloprid, the midgut of queens showed modifications in the external musculature and cellular alterations. Such changes could lead to the nonrecovery of the epithelium and subsequently malabsorption of nutrients. Moreover, the digestive cells of queen bees exposed to the commercial imidacloprid presented pyknotic nuclei, suggesting a cell death process. The main alterations observed in the ovaries of these reproductive bees treated with commercial imidacloprid were degeneration and resorption of the ovariole content, which probably affected their fertilization and colony development. There were no significant changes in the spermatozoa morphology for both treatments with imidacloprid, but this insecticide may interfere with the development and reproductive success of A. mellifera colonies because it affects the morphology and function of essential organs for the survival of queens.

Compared with the well-studied roles of these pesticides in nontarget site (including midgut, ovary, or salivary glands), little has been reported in the target sites, the brain. In the current study, laboratory-reared adult worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were treated with sublethal doses of imidacloprid. Neuronal apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL technique for DNA labeling. We observed significantly increased apoptotic markers in dose- and time-dependent manners in brains of bees exposed to imidacloprid. Neuronal activated caspase-3 and mRNA levels of caspase-1, as detected by immunofluorescence and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively, were significantly increased, suggesting that sublethal doses of imidacloprid may induce the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, the overlap of apoptosis and autophagy in neurons was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. It further suggests that a relationship exists between neurotoxicity and behavioral changes induced by sublethal doses of imidacloprid, and that there is a need to determine reasonable limits for imidacloprid application in the field to protect pollinators. ¬© The Authors 2015.

To do this, honey bee larvae reared in an incubator were exposed to one of nine pesticides: chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid, amitraz, fluvalinate, coumaphos, myclobutanil, chlorothalonil, glyphosate and simazine. Following this, larvae were fixed and prepared for immunohistologically detected cellular death using two TUNEL techniques for DNA fragmentation labeling and Annexin V to detect the localization of exposed PS specific in situ binding to apoptotic cells. Untreated larvae experienced ‚àº10% midgut apoptotic cell death under controlled conditions. All applied pesticides triggered an increase in apoptosis in treated compared to untreated larvae. The level of cell death in the midgut of simazine-treated larvae was highest at 77% mortality and statistically similar to the level of cell death for chlorpyrifos (65%), imidacloprid (61%), myclobutanil (69%), and glyphosate (69%) treated larvae. Larvae exposed to fluvalinate had the lowest midgut columnar apoptotic cell death (30%) of any pesticide-treated larvae. Indications of elevated apoptotic cell death in salivary glands and ovaries after pesticide application were detected. Annexin V localization, indicative of apoptotic cell deletion, had an extensive distribution in the midgut, salivary glands and ovaries of pesticide-treated larvae. The data suggest that the tested pesticides induced apoptosis in tissues of honey bee larvae at the tested concentrations. Cell death localization as a tool for a monitoring the subclinical and sub-lethal effects of external influences on honey bee larval tissues is discussed. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.",2011///,2011,10.1016/j.pestbp.2010.12.005,99,2,,,200,207,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78751703703&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2010.12.005&partnerID=40&md5=bdce5d24cb5f8dd19606876e705079ed,Scopus,,,0,,1,29
18,JOUR,Imidacloprid-induced impairment of mushroom bodies and behavior of the native stingless bee melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides,"['van Tom√©, H.V.', 'Martins, G.F.', 'Lima, M.A.P.', 'Campos, L.A.O.', 'Guedes, R.N.C.']",PLoS ONE,"Declines in pollinator colonies represent a worldwide concern. The widespread use of agricultural pesticides is recognized as a potential cause of these declines. Previous studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides such as imidacloprid on pollinator colonies, but these investigations have mainly focused on adult honey bees. Native stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae) are key pollinators in neotropical areas and are threatened with extinction due to deforestation and pesticide use. Few studies have directly investigated the effects of pesticides on these pollinators. Furthermore, the existing impact studies did not address the issue of larval ingestion of contaminated pollen and nectar, which could potentially have dire consequences for the colony. Here, we assessed the effects of imidacloprid ingestion by stingless bee larvae on their survival, development, neuromorphology and adult walking behavior. Increasing doses of imidacloprid were added to the diet provided to individual worker larvae of the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides throughout their development. Survival rates above 50% were only observed at insecticide doses lower than 0.0056 Œºg active ingredient (a.i.)/bee. No sublethal effect on body mass or developmental time was observed in the surviving insects, but the pesticide treatment negatively affected the development of mushroom bodies in the brain and impaired the walking behavior of newly emerged adult workers. Therefore, stingless bee larvae are particularly susceptible to imidacloprid, as it caused both high mortality and sublethal effects that impaired brain development and compromised mobility at the young adult stage. These findings demonstrate the lethal effects of imidacloprid on native stingless bees and provide evidence of novel serious sublethal effects that may compromise colony survival. The ecological and economic importance of neotropical stingless bees as pollinators, their susceptibility to insecticides and the vulnerability of their larvae to insecticide exposure emphasize the importance of studying these species. ¬© 2012 Tom√© et al.",2012///,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0038406,7,6,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861849676&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0038406&partnerID=40&md5=c79d1d494822feae704376b9953a9f04,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,30

Previous studies have demonstrated that this phenomenon originates from abnormal neural development in response to imidacloprid exposure. Here, we further investigated the global gene expression changes in the heads of newly emerged adults and observed that 578 genes showed more than 2-fold changes in gene expression after imidacloprid exposure. This information might aid in understanding the effects of pesticides on the health of pollinators. For example, the genes encoding major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), a group of multifunctional proteins with significant roles in the sustainable development of bee colonies, were strongly downregulated. These downregulation patterns were further confirmed through analyses using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the heads of 6-day-old nurse bees. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that sublethal doses of imidacloprid affect mrjp expression and likely weaken bee colonies. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.06.016,88,,12,20,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85025668629&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibmb.2017.06.016&partnerID=40&md5=5ca3cfa3188f17da11c61610c758cac2,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,31
169,JOUR,Melatonin enhances the antioxidant capacity to rescue the honey bee Apis mellifera from the ecotoxicological effects caused by environmental imidacloprid,"['Li, Z.', 'Duan, J.', 'Chen, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Qin, Q.', 'Dang, X.', 'Zhou, Z.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Imidacloprid severely poisons the nontarget insect honey bee Apis mellifera. Few treatments are available to mitigate the adverse effects of imidacloprid. The primary concern is that the molecular understanding of imidacloprid toxicity is not comprehensive enough. Oxidative stress is the primary pathophysiological mechanism by which pesticides cause high mortality. Our pilot study found for the first time that imidacloprid stimulates bee brains to secrete melatonin, a free radical scavenger. However, the molecular basis for imidacloprid toxicity and the role of melatonin in coping with imidacloprid have not been systematically investigated in bees. This study administered an environmental dose of imidacloprid (36 ng/bee) orally to A. mellifera. The detoxification gene cytochrome P450 CYP4G11 was significantly induced. However, potent cytotoxicity of imidacloprid suppressed the expression of the antioxidants catalase (CAT) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), and the activity of guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione (GSH) was not induced. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were increased. The expression of the apoptotic genes cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase (Caspase-3) and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) increased, and the apoptotic features of midgut cells were prominently apparent. These results suggest that imidacloprid disrupts the bee antioxidant system, causing severe oxidative stress and tissue damage and ultimately leading to apoptosis. Significantly, however, imidacloprid exposure also stimulated bee brains to continuously secrete melatonin. Further preadministration of exogenous melatonin (200 ng/bee) orally to bees significantly reversed and enhanced the activity of the imidacloprid-suppressed antioxidants CAT, SOD, and GSH, which allowed imidacloprid-induced ROS accumulation to be effectively alleviated. The MDA content, apoptotic genes Caspase-3 and AIF, and detoxification gene CYPG411 expression were restored to normalization; midgut cell damage, apoptosis, and mortality were significantly reduced. These findings strongly suggest that melatonin enhanced bee antioxidant capacity, thus attenuating oxidative stress and apoptosis to confer imidacloprid tolerance to honey bees. Melatonin secretion may be a defense mechanism to mitigate imidacloprid toxicity. ¬© 2022 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113622,239,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134600223&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2022.113622&partnerID=40&md5=dfb131e5e7edc48e5b87ea1ce00d95a6,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'survival', 'mortality', 'gene expression', 'Imidacloprid', 'animal cell', 'apoptosis', 'caspase 3', 'catalase', 'gene', 'unclassified drug', 'animal tissue', 'midgut', 'metabolism', 'cytochrome P450', 'protein expression', 'detoxification', 'tissue injury', 'enzyme activity', 'pilot study', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'cytotoxicity', 'animal model', 'oxidative stress', 'cell damage', 'antioxidant', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Oxidative stress', 'melatonin', 'hormone synthesis', 'Antioxidants', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'glutathione', 'malonaldehyde', 'Pilot Projects', 'antioxidant activity', 'lipid peroxidation', 'CYP4G11 gene', 'Antioxidant', 'apoptosis inducing factor', 'Caspase 3', 'cytochrome P450 4G11', 'gene induction', 'guaiacol peroxidase', 'hormone release', 'intestine cell', 'Melatonin', 'thioredoxin reductase']",,,,0,,1,32

Sometimes, a simultaneous action of multiple stressors, natural and chemical, results in even greater effect than of any stressor alone. Therefore, integrative investigations of different factors affecting honey bees have to be carried out. In this study, adult honey bees exposed to thiamethoxam in larval and/or adult stage and infected with Nosema ceranae were examined. Newly emerged bees from colonies, non-treated or treated with thiamethoxam, were organized in six groups and kept in cages. Thiamethoxam treated bees were further exposed to either thiamethoxam or Nosema (groups TT and TN), or simultaneously to both (group TTN). Newly emerged bees from non-treated colonies were exposed to Nosema (group CN). From both, treated and non-treated colonies two groups were organized and further fed only with sugar solution (groups C and TC). Here, we present the expression profile of 19 genes in adult worker honey bees comprising those involved in immune, detoxification, development and apoptosis response. Results showed that gene expression patterns changed with time and depended on the treatment. In group TC at the time of emergence the majority of tested genes were downregulated, among which nine were significantly altered. The same gene pattern was observed on day six, where the only significantly upregulated gene was defensin-1. On day nine most of analyzed genes in all experimental groups showed upregulation compared to control group, where upregulation of antimicrobial peptide genes abaecin, defensin-1 and defensin-2 was significant in groups TT and TTN. On day 15 we observed a similar pattern of expression in groups TC and TT exposed to thiamethoxam only, where most of the detoxification genes were downregulated.

Thiamethoxam reduced the survival of larvae and pupae and consequently decreased the percentage of emerging honey bees. Thiamethoxam induced important physiological disturbances. It increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at all developmental stages and increased glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and carboxylesterase para (CaEp) activities at the pupal stages. For midgut alkaline phosphatase (ALP), no activity was detected in pupae stages, and no effect was observed in larvae and emerging bees. We assume that the effects of thiamethoxam on the survival, emergence and physiology of honey bees may affect the development of the colony.

How both factors affect gene expression and honey bee survival are well studied. However, only a few studies dealt with the interactions of the two factors. Here we studied the effects of both, when alone and in combination, on honey bee survival and expression changes of immune and detoxification genes. Newly emerged bees were randomly assigned four different treatments: control bees, bees exposed to thiamethoxam, bees exposed to thiamethoxam and then infected with Nosema, and bees infected with N.ceranae only. When combined with Nosema, thiamethoxam caused a significant reduction in survival from the control, but this reduction is not significantly different from N. ceranae alone. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused significantly increased expressions compared to the control for the genes of abaecin, apidaecin and hymenoptacin, but significantly decreased expression for the defensin gene. When the two factors were combined, the expression patterns were similar to N.ceranae infection alone (apidaecin, defencin and hymenoptaecin), except abaecin, which was increased compared to Nosema infected bees. For detoxification genesCCE8 and CYP315A1, thiamethoxam caused significantly increased gene expression but Nosema caused significantly decreased expression. When combined, the two factors did not show a further increase in Mortality compared to Nosema infection alone. Our study shows a clear combined effect of thiamethoxam and Nosema, but mainly in worker mortality and very little effect on gene expression.

Additionally, honey bees exposed to different stressors, such as parasites and the pathogens they vector, may further affect their health. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined or sole effect of two stressors on developing honey bees under laboratory conditions where larvae were per os treated with realistic field doses of imidacloprid and later infested with Varroa destructor. Here, we present a gene expression profile of 15 immune-related genes in different honey bee development stages (white-eyed pupae, brown-eyed pupae, and emerged honey bees). Our results show that pesticide consumed in the larval stage lead to a decrease in immune response of bees in early development stages (white- and brown-eyed pupae) and later to an increase in honey bee immune response, and thus honey bee health may be challenged. The gene expression patterns of Varroa infested honey bees changed during development with the number of significantly differentially expressed genes increasing from white-eyed pupae to newly emerged honey bees. The effect of both stressors has a significant effect on antimicrobial peptides and genes involved in defense (apidaecin, hymenoptaecin, defensin-1, lysozyme-2, and PPO) in different developmental stages.

Among pesticides, neonicotinoid insecticides are the biggest threat. Due to their extensive use, they can be found in all agricultural environments, including soil, water, and air, are persistent in the environment, and are highly toxic for honey bees. In addition, infection by different pests and pathogens can act synergistically, weakening bees. In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid alone or combined with the microsporidia Nosema ceranae on the immune response, deformed wing virus infection (DWV), gut microbiota, and survival of Africanized honey bees. We found that imidacloprid affected the expression of some genes associated with immunity generating an altered physiological state, although it did not favor DWV or N. ceranae infection. The pesticide alone did not affect honey bee gut microbiota, as previously suggested, but when administered to N. ceranae infected bees, it generated significant changes. Finally, both stress factors caused high mortality rates. Those results illustrate the negative impact of imidacloprid alone or combined with N. ceranae on Africanized honey bees and are useful to understand colony losses in Latin America. ¬© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s00248-022-02014-8,85,4,1485,1497,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128741852&doi=10.1007%2fs00248-022-02014-8&partnerID=40&md5=ae0780b379653a3f3d13e29ca7226d55,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'deformed wing virus', 'Nosema', 'Deformed wing virus', 'Imidacloprid', 'intestine flora', 'Nosema ceranae', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome', 'Honey bee gut microbiota', 'Honey bee immunity', 'Honey bee survival']",,,,0,,1,37

Honey bees were exposed to different concentrations of imidacloprid during a time period of 40 days. Next to these variables, a laboratory-field comparison was conducted. The influence of the chronic exposure on gene expression levels was determined using an in-house developed microarray targeting different immunity-related and detoxification genes to determine stress-related gene expression changes. Increased levels of the detoxification genes encoding, CYP9Q3 and CYT P450, were detected in imidaclo-prid-exposed honey bees. The different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on honey bees were confirmed physiologically by decreased hypopharyngeal gland sizes. Honey bees exposed to imidacloprid in laboratory cages showed a general immunosuppression and no detoxification mechanisms were triggered significantly, while honey bees infield showed a resilient response with an immune stimulation at later time points. However, the treated colonies had a brood and population decline tendency after the first brood cycle in the field. In conclusion, this study highlighted the different context-dependent effects of imidacloprid exposure on the honey bee response. These findings warn for possible pitfalls concerning the generalization of results based on specific experiments with short exposure times. The increased levels of CYT P450 and CYP9Q3 combined with an immune response reaction can be used as markers for bees which are exposed to pesticides in the field. ¬© 2017 De Smet et al.

Multiple studies have shown that these factors can interact, producing a synergistic effect that can compromise the viability of honey bees. This study analyses the interactions between different pesticides and the microsporidium Nosema ceranae and their effect on immune and detoxification gene expression, sugar consumption and mortality in the Iberian western honey bee (Apis mellifera iberiensis). For this purpose, workers were infected with N. ceranae and subjected to a sugar-water diet with field concentrations of the pesticides sulfoxaflor, azoxystrobin and glyphosate. Increased sugar intake and altered immune and cytochrome P450 gene expression were observed in workers exposed to sulfoxaflor and infected with N. ceranae. None of the pesticides affected Nosema spore production in honey bee gut. Of the three pesticides tested (alone or in combination) only sulfoxaflor increased mortality in honey bees. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects of sulfoxaflor were attenuated in contact with other pesticides, and that Nosema infection leads to increase sugar intake in sulfoxaflor-exposed bees. Overall, this underlines the importance of studying the interaction between different stressors to understand their overall impact not only on honey bee but also on wild bees health. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115427,264,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85170102765&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.115427&partnerID=40&md5=f2260686df7f9c4ba8a5b22ea071ba0b,Scopus,"['agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apis mellifera iberiensis', 'Article', 'azoxystrobin', 'bacterial reproduction', 'bacterial spore', 'bee', 'Bees', 'chemical pest control', 'controlled study', 'cytochrome P450', 'detoxification', 'diet', 'gastrointestinal tract', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'glyphosate', 'health', 'honey bee gut', 'honeybee', 'Iberian western honey bee', 'immune response', 'immunity', 'Microsporidia', 'mortality', 'Mortality', 'nonhuman', 'Nosema', 'Nosema ceranae', 'nosemosis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'sugar', 'sugar intake', 'sugar-water diet', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'unclassified drug', 'water', 'worker (insect)']",,,,0,,1,39

Several studies show that low doses of this neurotoxin influence honey bee physiology, however, little is known about how insecticides interact with other environmental variables. We studied the effects of two neonicotinoid Imidacloprid doses (IMD, 0, 2.5, and 10 ppb), and three temperatures (20, 28, and 36¬∞C) on gene expression in the brains of worker honey bees (Apis mellifera). Using qRT-PCR we quantified the expression of eight key genes related to the nervous system, stress response, and motor and olfactory capacities. Gene expression tended to increase with the low IMD dose, which was further intensified in individuals maintained in the cold treatment (20¬∞C). At 20¬∞C the octopamine receptor gene (oa1) was underexpressed in bees that were not exposed to IMD, but overexpressed in individuals exposed to 2.5 ppb IMD. Also, heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) increased their expression at high temperatures (36¬∞C), but not with IMD doses. These results suggest that despite the low insecticide concentrations used in this study (a field-realistic dose), changes in gene expression associated with honey bee physiological responses could be induced. This study contributes to the understanding of how neonicotinoid residual doses may alter honey bee physiology. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102696,93,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089956447&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtherbio.2020.102696&partnerID=40&md5=11df331a17c8d5a06377ab9e7a9f3be2,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'drug effect', 'adult', 'Neonicotinoid', 'Honey bee', 'high temperature', 'temperature', 'Temperature', 'Imidacloprid', 'gene', 'motor activity', 'animal tissue', 'metabolism', 'heat shock protein 70', 'heat shock protein 90', 'Gene expression', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'brain', 'genetics', 'insect protein', 'protein expression', 'Brain', 'pilot study', 'Insect Proteins', 'temperature sensitivity', 'nervous system', 'stress', 'olfactory system', 'brain region', 'gene overexpression', 'cold treatment', 'heat shock response', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins', 'norsynephrine receptor', 'octopamine receptor gene', 'receptor', 'Receptors, Biogenic Amine', 'Residual doses']",,,,0,,1,40

However, most studies so far conducted have focused on the effect of these stressors separately and in European honey bees. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the impact of both stressors, singly and in combination, on honey bees of African descent that have demonstrated resistance to parasites and pesticides. Africanized honey bees (AHBs, Apis mellifera scutellata Lepeletier) were inoculated with N. ceranae (1 √ó 105 spores/bee) and/or chronically exposed for 18 days to a sublethal dose of thiamethoxam (0.025 ng/bee) to evaluate their single and combined effects on food consumption, survivorship, N. ceranae infection, and immunity at the cellular and humoral levels. No significant effects by any of the stressors were found for food consumption. However, thiamethoxam was the main stressor associated to a significant decrease in AHB survivorship, whereas N. ceranae was the main stressor affecting their humoral immune response by upregulating the expression of the gene AmHym-1. Additionally, both stressors, separately and combined, significantly decreased the concentration of haemocytes in the haemolymph of the bees. These findings indicate that N. ceranae and thiamethoxam differentially affect the lifespan and immunity of AHBs and do not seem to have synergistic effects when AHBs are simultaneously exposed to both stressors. ¬© 2023 by the authors.",2023///,2023,10.3390/microorganisms11051258,11,5,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160758660&doi=10.3390%2fmicroorganisms11051258&partnerID=40&md5=c25adb86e90ea97d6595e4b6933d44e6,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'gene expression', 'Nosema ceranae', 'neonicotinoid insecticides', 'cellular immunity', 'haemocytes', 'humoral immunity']",,,,0,,1,41

Results showed a significant decrease in bee longevity across all treatments compared to the control, with the combination of flupyradifurone, microplastics, and N. ceranae having the most severe impact. Microplastics and flupyradifurone exposure also increased N. ceranae proliferation, especially in bees subjected to both stressors.

We examined the separate and combined effects of N. ceranae and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam at field-exposure levels on the survivorship and cellular immunity (hemocyte concentration) of the stingless bee Melipona colimana. Newly-emerged bees were subjected to four treatments provided in sucrose syrup: N. ceranae spores, thiamethoxam, thiamethoxam and N. ceranae, and control (bees receiving only syrup). N. ceranae developed infections of > 467,000 spores/bee in the group treated with spores only. However, in the bees subjected to both stressors, infections were < 143,000 spores/bee, likely due to an inhibitory effect of thiamethoxam on the microsporidium. N. ceranae infections did not affect bee survivorship, but thiamethoxam plus N. ceranae significantly increased mortality. Hemocyte counts were significantly lower in N. ceranae infected-bees than in the other treatments. These results suggest that N. ceranae may infect, proliferate and cause cellular immunosuppression in stingless bees, that exposure to sublethal thiamethoxam concentrations is toxic to M. colimana when infected with N. ceranae, and that thiamethoxam restrains N. ceranae proliferation.

Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the most probable factors due to the physiological and behavioral damage they cause to honey bees. However, the influence of thiacloprid, a relatively less toxic cyanogen-substituted form of neonicotinoid, on honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) development is not well studied. The toxicity of sublethal thiacloprid to larvae, pupae, and emerging honey bees was assessed under laboratory conditions. We found that thiacloprid reduced the survival rate of larvae and pupae, and delayed the development of bees which led to lower bodyweight and size. Furthermore, we identified differentially expressed genes involved in metabolism and immunity though RNA-sequencing of newly-emerged adult bees. GO enrichment analysis identified genes involved in metabolism, catalytic activity, and transporter activity. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that thiacloprid induced up-regulation of genes related to glutathione metabolism and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Overall, our results suggest that chronic sublethal thiacloprid can affect honey bee colonies by reducing survival and delaying bee development.

Studies performed for twenty years suggest that this decline may involve both infectious diseases and exposure to pesticides. Joint action of pathogens and chemicals are known to threaten several organisms but the combined effects of these stressors were poorly investigated in honeybees. Our study was designed to explore the effect of Nosema ceranae infection on honeybee sensitivity to sublethal doses of the insecticides fipronil and thiacloprid. Methodology/Finding: Five days after their emergence, honeybees were divided in 6 experimental groups: (i) uninfected controls, (ii) infected with N. ceranae, (iii) uninfected and exposed to fipronil, (iv) uninfected and exposed to thiacloprid, (v) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days post-infection (p. i.) to fipronil, and (vi) infected with N. ceranae and exposed 10 days p. i. to thiacloprid. Honeybee mortality and insecticide consumption were analyzed daily and the intestinal spore content was evaluated 20 days after infection. A significant increase in honeybee mortality was observed when N. ceranae-infected honeybees were exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. Surprisingly, exposures to fipronil and thiacloprid had opposite effects on microsporidian spore production. Analysis of the honeybee detoxification system 10 days p. i. showed that N. ceranae infection induced an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in midgut and fat body but not in 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity. Conclusions/Significance: After exposure to sublethal doses of fipronil or thiacloprid a higher mortality was observed in N. ceranae-infected honeybees than in uninfected ones. The synergistic effect of N. ceranae and insecticide on honeybee mortality, however, did not appear strongly linked to a decrease of the insect detoxification system.

Royal jelly containing 1 ppb imidacloprid was provided to larvae for 3 consecutive days (2‚Äì4 days postemergence). Queen larvae treated with imidacloprid showed lower capping and emergence rates (35.5% and 24.22%, respectively) than did control larvae (61.68% and 52.95%, respectively), indicating a high failure rate of queen rearing associated with imidacloprid exposure during the larval stage. The molecular response to imidacloprid treatment was examined next. By comparing the gene expression profiles of imidacloprid-treated queen larvae and those of control queen larvae using DESeq2, we identified 215 differentially expressed genes, with 105 and 111 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. Gene Ontology results indicated that chitin binding‚Äì and calcium ion binding‚Äìrelated genes were upregulated, while phototransduction- and visual perception‚Äìrelated genes were downregulated.

In this study, the potential sublethal effects of selected neonicotinoids on honey bee larvae were investigated by protein expression profiling for the first time. The total larval protein expression was investigated by 2D gel electrophoresis after exposure to the insecticides dimethoate, fenoxycarb and flupyradifurone. Protein spots whose concentrations differed significantly from the controls were sequenced and identified against known insect proteins. Although the treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development, the proteome comparisons showed differences in the metabolism, immune response and energy supply of the bee larvae. The strongest influence was found for flupyradifurone, which activates various detoxification pathways, the immune response or tissue regeneration. Our results suggest that there may be a delayed larval development or possibly a reduced honey bee brood vitality at sublethal concentrations. The western honey bee Apis mellifera is globally distributed due to its beekeeping advantages and plays an important role in the global ecology and economy. In recent decades, several studies have raised concerns about bee decline. Discussed are multiple reasons such as increased pathogen pressure, malnutrition or pesticide use. Insecticides are considered to be one of the major factors. In 2013, the use of three neonicotinoids in the field was prohibited in the EU. Flupyradifurone was introduced as a potential successor; it has a comparable mode of action as the banned neonicotinoids. However, there is a limited number of studies on the effects of sublethal concentrations of flupyradifurone on honey bees. Particularly, the larval physiological response by means of protein expression has not yet been studied. Hence, the larval protein expression was investigated via 2D gel electrophoresis after following a standardised protocol to apply sublethal concentrations of the active substance (flupyradifurone 10 mg/kg diet) to larval food. The treated larvae did not show increased mortality or an aberrant development. Proteome comparisons showed clear differences concerning the larval metabolism, immune response and energy supply.

Newly emerged bees were exposed individually per os to TMX, at doses of 0.0856 ng/bee or 0.00856 ng/bee, or to TMX doses and 60,000 spores of N. ceranae per bee. Eight days after the single exposure, the results showed that TMX was extremely deleterious to the HNS at 0.00856 ng/bee, dramatically inducing morphological changes in HNS cells (trophocytes and oenocytes) and increasing hemocyte number. However, the treatment to TMX at 0.00856 ng/bee with additional NOS inoculation provoked the highest critical damage observed on HNS, collapsing the trophocytes, reducing the surface area of oenocytes, and inducing cell death in pericardial cells.

452,JOUR,Immune related gene expression in worker honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica) pupae exposed to neonicotinoid thiamethoxam and Varroa mites (Varroa destructor),"['Tesovnik, T.', 'Cizelj, I.', 'Zorc, M.', 'ƒåitar, M.', 'Bo≈æiƒç, J.', 'Glavan, G.', 'Narat, M.']",PLoS ONE,"Varroa destructor is one of the most common parasites of honey bee colonies and is considered as a possible co-factor for honey bee decline. At the same time, the use of pesticides in intensive agriculture is still the most effective method of pest control. There is limited information about the effects of pesticide exposure on parasitized honey bees. Larval ingestion of certain pesticides could have effects on honey bee immune defense mechanisms, development and metabolic pathways. Europe and America face the disturbing phenomenon of the disappearance of honey bee colonies, termed Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). One reason discussed is the possible suppression of honey bee immune system as a consequence of prolonged exposure to chemicals. In this study, the effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on honey bee, Apis mellifera carnica, pupae infested with Varroa destructor mites were analyzed at the molecular level. Varroa-infested and non-infested honey bee colonies received protein cakes with or without thiamethoxam. Nurse bees used these cakes as a feed for developing larvae. Samples of white-eyed and brown-eyed pupae were collected. Expression of 17 immune-related genes was analyzed by real-time PCR. Relative gene expression in samples exposed only to Varroa or to thiamethoxam or simultaneously to both Varroa and thiamethoxam was compared. The impact from the consumption of thiamethoxam during the larval stage on honey bee immune related gene expression in Varroa-infested white-eyed pupae was reflected as down-regulation of spaetzle, AMPs abaecin and defensin-1 and up-regulation of lysozyme-2. In brown-eyed pupae up-regulation of PPOact, spaetzle, hopscotch and basket genes was detected. Moreover, we observed a major difference in immune response to Varroa infestation between white-eyed pupae and brown-eyed pupae. The majority of tested immune-related genes were upregulated only in brown-eyed pupae, while in white-eyed pupae they were downregulated. ¬© 2017 Tesovnik et al.

93,JOUR,Intake of imidacloprid in lethal and sublethal doses alters gene expression in Apis mellifera bees,"['de Castro Lippi, I.C.', 'da Luz Scheffer, J.', 'de Lima, Y.S.', 'Lunardi, J.S.', 'Astolfi, A.', 'Kadri, S.M.', 'Alvarez, M.V.N.', 'de Oliveira Orsi, R.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Bees are important pollinators for ecosystems and agriculture; however, populations have suffered a decline that may be associated with several factors, including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to diseases and parasites and use of pesticides. The extensive use of neonicotinoids, including imidacloprid, as agricultural pesticides, leads to their persistence in the environment and accumulation in bees, pollen, nectar, and honey, thereby inducing deleterious effects. Forager honey bees face significant exposure to pesticide residues while searching for resources outside the hive, particularly systemic pesticides like imidacloprid. In this study, 360 Apis mellifera bees, twenty-one days old (supposed to be in the forager phase) previously marked were fed syrup (honey and water, 1:1 m/v) containing a lethal dose (0.081 Œºg/bee) or sublethal dose (0.00081 Œºg/bee) of imidacloprid. The syrup was provided in plastic troughs, with 250 ŒºL added per trough onto each plastic Petri dish containing 5 bees (50 ŒºL per bee). The bees were kept in the plastic Petri dishes inside an incubator, and after 1 and 4 h of ingestion, the bees were euthanised and stored in an ultra-freezer (‚àí80 ¬∞C) for transcriptome analysis. Following the 1-h ingestion of imidacloprid, 1516 genes (73 from lethal dose; 1509 from sublethal dose) showed differential expression compared to the control, while after 4 h, 758 genes (733 from lethal dose; 25 from sublethal) exhibited differential expression compared to the control. All differentially expressed genes found in the brain tissue transcripts of forager bees were categorised based on gene ontology into functional groups encompassing biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components. These analyses revealed that sublethal doses might be capable of altering more genes than lethal doses, potentially associated with a phenomenon known as insecticide-induced hormesis. Alterations in genes related to areas such as the immune system, nutritional metabolism, detoxification system, circadian rhythm, odour detection, foraging activity, and memory in bees were present after exposure to the pesticide. These findings underscore the detrimental effects of both lethal and sublethal doses of imidacloprid, thereby providing valuable insights for establishing public policies regarding the use of neonicotinoids, which are directly implicated in the compromised health of Apis mellifera bees. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173393,940,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195060066&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.173393&partnerID=40&md5=d3c9ad12954c60ff9587c3c21a2f36a5,Scopus,"['agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'apiculture', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Beekeeping', 'Bees', 'beta galactosidase', 'circadian rhythm', 'climate change', 'Climate change', 'deformity', 'detoxification', 'Detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'false discovery rate', 'Food products', 'galactosidase', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Gene Expression', 'gene ontology', 'Gene Ontology', 'Genes expression', 'honey', 'honeybee', 'Hormesis', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprids', 'immune system', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide-induced hormesis', 'Insecticides', 'lethal dose', 'Lethal dose', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'parasite', 'peptide synthesis', 'Pesticide', 'Petri dish', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population', 'Population statistics', 'reactive oxygen metabolite', 'ribosome', 'RNA binding', 'sublethal dose', 'Sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'temperature', 'vulnerability']",,,,0,,1,50

Responses to the neonicotinoid imidacloprid have been studied largely at individual adult and colony levels, focusing mostly on behavioral and physiological effects. Data from developing larvae, whose health is critical for colony success, are deficient, particularly at the molecular level where transcriptomes can reveal disruption of fundamental biological pathways. We investigated gene expression of Bombus impatiens larvae exposed through food provisions to two field-realistic imidacloprid concentrations (0.7 and 7.0¬†ppb). We hypothesized both concentrations would alter gene expression, but the higher concentration would have greater qualitative and quantitative effects. We found 678 genes differentially expressed under both imidacloprid exposures relative to controls, including mitochondrial activity, development, and DNA replication genes. However, more genes were differentially expressed with higher imidacloprid exposure; uniquely differentially expressed genes included starvation response and cuticle genes. The former may partially result from reduced pollen use, monitored to verify food provision use and provide additional context to results. A smaller differentially expressed set only in lower concentration larvae, included neural development and cell growth genes. Our findings show varying molecular consequences under different field-realistic neonicotinoid concentrations, and that even low concentrations may affect fundamental biological processes. ¬© 2023, The Author(s).",2023///,2023,10.1038/s41598-023-36232-y,13,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163073015&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-023-36232-y&partnerID=40&md5=f5069c8d635fec9783e72eda798cf54e,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'larva', 'Larva', 'gene expression', 'genetics', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'Gene Expression']",,,,0,,1,51
59,JOUR,Proteome analysis reveals the molecular basis of honeybee brain and midgut response to sulfoxaflor,"['Shi, T.', 'Meng, L.', 'Jiang, X.', 'Cao, H.', 'Yu, L.']",Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology,"Sulfoxaflor is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. However, the molecular effects of sublethal sulfoxaflor on honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) remain elusive. Here, the effects of a sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor (0.05 Œºg/bee) on the brain and midgut proteome response of the honeybee were investigated. Exposure to sublethal sulfoxaflor doses did not cause significant honeybee death, but it induced significant alterations in the brain and midgut proteomes. After sulfoxaflor challenge, 135 and 28 proteins were differentially regulated in the brain and midgut, respectively. The up-regulated proteins were mainly implicated in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter transport and drug metabolism processes, and included in particular enzymes of the citrate cycle and cellular respiration process, such as ATP citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase, cytochrome b-c1 complex subunits, and NADH dehydrogenase. These findings suggest that honeybees enhance energy metabolism in the midgut and brain to resist sulfoxaflor challenge. Notably, treatment with sulfoxaflor resulted in a 6.8 times increase in expression levels of the major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) in the brain, and knockdown of MRJP1 mRNA expression using RNA interference significantly decreased the survival rate, indicating that MRJP1 may play an important role in sulfoxaflor tolerance. Our data reveals that sulfoxaflor influences multiple processes related to both metabolism and the nervous system, and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of the honeybee brain and midgut response to sublethal dose of sulfoxaflor. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.pestbp.2022.105168,186,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133685313&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2022.105168&partnerID=40&md5=b1ef6e8626b7374409ce791d5d5e90fb,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'metabolism', 'brain', 'genetics', 'insect protein', 'Apis mellifera L.', 'Brain', 'Insect Proteins', 'proteome', 'Proteome', 'Global proteome', 'Metabolism pathways', 'Molecular effects']",,,,0,,1,52

Simultaneously, imidacloprid can cause damage associated with metabolism as well as, neuronal damage, cellular stress, and impairment of the detoxification system.

Here we describe global transcriptomic profiles in the brain of honey bee workers exposed for 48 h at one environmentally realistic and one sublethal concentration of 0.3 and 3.0 ng/bee clothianidin and imidacloprid, respectively, and 0.1 and 1.0 ng/bee thiamethoxam (1-30 ng/mL sucrose solution) by high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). All neonicotinoids led to significant alteration (mainly down-regulation) of gene expression, generally with a concentration-dependent effect. Among many others, genes related to metabolism and detoxification were differently expressed. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of biological processes revealed catabolic carbohydrate metabolism (regulation of enzyme activities such as amylase), lipid metabolism, and transport mechanisms as shared terms between all neonicotinoids at high concentrations. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that at least two neonicotinoids induced changes in expression of various metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathways, starch and sucrose metabolism, and sulfur metabolism, in which glucose 1-dehydrogenase and alpha-amylase were down-regulated and 3‚Ä≤(2‚Ä≤), 5‚Ä≤-bisphosphate nucleotidase was up-regulated. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of major royal jelly proteins, hbg3, and cyp9e2 found by RNA-seq.

In this context, the A. mellifera foragers were exposed to a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam (LC50/100: 0,0227 ng de thiamethoxam/ŒºL‚àí1 diet), a neurotoxic insecticide, for 8 days; and it was decided to investigate the insecticide effect on the brain by a shotgun proteomic approach followed by label-free quantitative-based proteomics. A total of 401 proteins were identified in the control group (CG); and a total of 350 proteins in the thiamethoxam exposed group (TMX). Quantitative proteomics data showed up 251 proteins with significant quantitative values in the TMX group. These findings demonstrated the occurrence of shared and unique proteins with altered expression in the TMX group, such as ATP synthase subunit beta, heat shock protein cognate 4, spectrin beta chain-like, mushroom body large-type Kenyon cell-specific protein 1-like, tubulin alpha-1 chain-like, arginine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor, odorant receptor, glutamine synthetase, glutamate receptor, and cytochrome P450 4c3. Meanwhile, the proteins that were expressed uniquely in the TMX group are involved mainly in the phosphorylation, cellular protein modification, and cell surface receptor signalling processes. Interaction network results showed that identified proteins are present in five different metabolic pathways - oxidative stress, cytoskeleton control, visual process, olfactory memory, and glutamate metabolism.

The molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we measured the response of juvenile hormone (JH) to environmental concentrations of thiamethoxam using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), monitored the dynamic changes in the transcription of genes encoding major JH metabolic enzymes (CYP15A1, FAMET, JHAMT and JHE) using RT-qPCR, and analysed the transcriptome changes in worker larvae under thiamethoxam stress using RNA-seq. Thiamethoxam significantly increased the levels of JH3 in honey bee larvae, but no significant changes in the transcript levels of the four major metabolic enzymes were observed. Thiamethoxam exposure resulted in 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). P450 CYP6AS5 was upregulated, and some ion-related, odourant-related and gustatory receptors for sugar taste genes were altered significantly. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism and protein digestion and absorption were influenced by thiamethoxam. These changes may do harm to honey bee caste differentiation, foraging behaviour related to sensory perception and nutrient levels of bee colonies.

Sulfoxaflor is a new insecticide which acts on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in a similar way to neonicotinoids. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of sulfoxaflor and its effect on the A. mellifera exposure. RESULTS: Initially, developmental indicators such as larval survival, pupation, and eclosion were inhibited by 5.0 mg/L (field concentration) sulfoxaflor. In the pupal stage, fat content was significantly increased, while the glycogen content decreased. In addition, A. mellifera heads were treated with 2.0 mg/L (sublethal concentration) of sulfoxaflor and analyzed by RNA sequencing. The transcriptome results indicated that 2.0 mg/L amounts of sulfoxaflor have adverse effects on the immune, digestive, and nervous systems. Sulfoxaflor down-regulated the expression of many genes involved in immunity, detoxification, the myosin cytoskeleton, sensory neurons, and odor-binding proteins. CONCLUSION: Field concentration and sublethal concentration were used for the combined analysis of honeybees. The effect of sublethal concentration of sulfoxaflor on honeybees was studied for the first time from the perspective of transcriptome sequencing of honeybee head. A preliminary study was carried out on the stress of sulfoxaflor at sublethal concentration on honeybee workers, which has certain research significance and can provide theoretical basis for the use of sulfoxaflor in the field environment. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024///,2024,10.1002/ps.8326,80,11,5941,5953,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202068976&doi=10.1002%2fps.8326&partnerID=40&md5=f1ac3cc696efcebed199af2d398beea4,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'Larva', 'growth, development and aging', 'sublethal concentration', 'transcriptome', 'Transcriptome', 'pupa', 'genetic analysis', 'physiological response', 'Pupa', 'transcriptome analysis']",,,,0,,1,57

However, its effects on developing bee larvae remain largely unexplored. Our pilot study showed that imidacloprid causes developmental delay in bee larvae, but the underlying toxicological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we exposed bee larvae to imidacloprid at environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.7, 1.2, 3.1, and 377 ppb. There was a marked dose-dependent delay in larval development, characterized by reductions in body mass, width, and growth index. However, imidacloprid did not affect on larval survival and food consumption. The primary toxicological effects induced by elevated concentrations of imidacloprid (377 ppb) included inhibition of neural transmission gene expression, induction of oxidative stress, gut structural damage, and apoptosis, inhibition of developmental regulatory hormones and genes, suppression of gene expression levels involved in proteolysis, amino acid transport, protein synthesis, carbohydrate catabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis energy production. In addition, we found that the larvae may use antioxidant defenses and P450 detoxification mechanisms to mitigate the effects of imidacloprid. Ultimately, this study provides the first evidence that environmentally exposed imidacloprid can affect the growth and development of bee larvae by disrupting molting regulation and limiting the metabolism and utilization of dietary nutrients and energy.

Therefore, it is necessary to understand any potential effects of pesticides. The present study reports the acute toxicity and adverse effects of sulfoxaflor insecticide on the biochemical activity and histological changes on A. mellifera. The results showed that after 48 h post-treatment, the LD25 and LD50 values were 0.078 and 0.162 ¬µg/bee, respectively, of sulfoxaflor on A. mellifera. The detoxification enzyme activity shows an increase of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme on A. mellifera in response to sulfoxaflor at LD50 value. Conversely, no significant differences were found in mixed-function oxidation (MFO) activity. In addition, after 4 h of sulfoxaflor exposure, the brains of treated bees showed nuclear pyknosis and degeneration in some cells, which evolved to mushroom shaped tissue losses, mainly neurons replaced by vacuoles after 48 h. There was a slight effect on secretory vesicles in the hypopharyngeal gland after 4 h of exposure. After 48 h, the vacuolar cytoplasm and basophilic pyknotic nuclei were lost in the atrophied acini. After exposure to sulfoxaflor, the midgut of A. mellifera workers showed histological changes in epithelial cells.

IMD is known to disrupt honey bee physiology and colony health at a relatively low concentration compared to other pesticides. In this study, honey bee colonies were chronically exposed to field-realistic concentrations (5, 20, and 100 ppb) of IMD, and the body weight, flight performance, carbohydrate reserve, and lipid contents of forager bees analyzed. Transcriptome analyses followed by quantitative PCR were also conducted for both nurse and forager bees to elucidate any changes in energy metabolism related to phenotypic disorders. The body weights of newly emerged and nurse bees showed decreasing tendencies as the IMD concentration increased. In forager bees, however, IMD induced a biphasic change in body weight: body weight was decreased at the lower concentrations (5 and 20 ppb) but increased at the higher concentration (100 ppb). Nevertheless, the flight capability of forager bees significantly decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effects of IMD on target gene transcription in forager bees showed biphasic patterns between low (5 and 20 ppb) and high (100 ppb) concentrations. Nurse bees showed typical features of premature transition to foragers in a concentration-dependent manner. When exposed to low concentrations, forager bees exhibited downregulation of genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, upregulation of transporter activity, and a dose-dependent body weight reduction, which were similar to insulin resistance and diabetic symptoms. However, increased lipid metabolism and decreased energy metabolism with body weight gain were observed at high IMD concentration. Considered together, these results suggest that field-realistic doses of IMD alter honey bee energy metabolism in distinctly different ways at low and high concentrations, both of which negatively affect honey bee colony health. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.ibmb.2022.103759,144,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127010810&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibmb.2022.103759&partnerID=40&md5=7426091034dbc8f5d210a6320833c0af,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Honey bee', 'Imidacloprid', 'body weight', 'Chronic exposure', 'carbohydrate', 'Carbohydrates', 'Body Weight', 'Biphasic effect', 'Carbohydrate metabolism', 'Diabetes']",,,,0,,1,60

The nectar- and water-collecting, and climbing abilities of bees are crucial to the survival of the bees and the execution of responsibilities in bee colonies. Besides behavioral impact, data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of imidacloprid, especially by the way of RNA-seq at the transcriptomic level, are limited. We treated Apis mellifera L. with sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (0.1, 1 and 10 ppb) and determined the effect on behaviors and the transcriptomic changes. The sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid had a limited impact on the survival and syrup consumption of bees, but caused a significant increase in water consumption. Moreover, the climbing ability was significantly impaired by 10 ppb imidacloprid at 8 d. In the RNA-seq analysis, gene ontology (GO) term enrichment indicated a significant down-regulation of muscle-related genes, which might contribute to the impairment in climbing ability of bees. The enriched GO terms were attributed to the up-regulated ribosomal protein genes. Considering the ribosomal and extra-ribosomal functions of the ribosomal proteins, we hypothesized that imidacloprid also causes cell dysfunction.

It is imperative to identify factors responsible for accelerated declines in bee populations and develop solutions for reversing bee losses. While exact causes of colony losses remain elusive, risk factors thought to play key roles are ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and neonicotinoid pesticides. The present study aims to investigate effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide Imidacloprid and Varroa mites individually on survivorship, growth, physiology, virus dynamics and immunity of honey bee workers. Our study provides clear evidence that the exposure to sublethal doses of Imidacloprid could exert a significantly negative effect on health and survival of honey bees. We observed a significant reduction in the titer of vitellogenin (Vg), an egg yolk precursor that regulates the honey bees development and behavior and often are linked to energy homeostasis, in bees exposed to Imidacloprid. This result indicates that sublethal exposure to neonicotinoid could lead to increased energy usage in honey bees as detoxification is a energy-consuming metabolic process and suggests that Vg could be a useful biomarker for measuring levels of energy stress and sublethal effects of pesticides on honey bees. Measurement of the quantitative effects of different levels of Varroa mite infestation on the replication dynamic of Deformed wing virus (DWV), an RNA virus associated with Varroa infestation, and expression level of immune genes yields unique insights into how honey bees respond to stressors under laboratory conditions. ¬© 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",2017///,2017,10.1111/1744-7917.12335,24,3,467,477,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84995640098&doi=10.1111%2f1744-7917.12335&partnerID=40&md5=659cf5d6185c0bf5967ba20a021aebc4,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,64

Using reverse transcriptase polymeraschain reaction (RT-qPCR), the alteration in gene expression caused by exposure to this insecticide was quantified. A total of fiv genes were quantified: three primary antioxidant genes (Catalase (CAT), Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and Thioredoxin dismutase (Trxr1), one detoxification gene (Cytochrome P450 9Q3 (CYP9Q3)) and one gene with neuronal activity (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE1). The endogenous ribosomal protein S18 (RPS18) gene allowed the estimation of relative gene expression as the response to insecticide exposure. The AChE1 gene was overexpressed up to six hours after exposure; the remaining CYP9Q3, CAT, SOD1, and Trxr1 genes presented a similar behavior. At a sublethal dose and at short time intervals, flupyradifurone causes alteration in the relative expression of five genes in individual honeybees after oral exposure, which could cause a long-term adverse effect on hive health. ¬© 2023, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Besides synthetic insecticides biological compounds such as spinosad are used in agriculture and organic farming against insect pests. However, potential adverse effect at sublethal concentrations to pollinators are poorly known. Here we aim to determine potential adverse outcome pathways of spinosad and to identify molecular effects by investigating transcriptional alterations in the brain of honey bees. We experimentally exposed bees to three sublethal concentrations of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 ng spinosad/bee, and assessed transcriptional alterations of target genes. Additionally, we evaluated whether spinosad-induced transcriptional alterations were influenced by the time of the year. In April, alterations were most pronounced after 24 h exposure, while in June alterations occurred mostly after 48 h. In July, expressional alterations were often lower but the pattern was more similar to that in June than that in April. Down-regulation of genes encoding acetylcholine receptors, enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (cox5a, ndufb7 and cox17), cytochrome P450 dependent monooxygenases (cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3) and insulin-like peptide-1 were among the most significant transcriptional alterations. This suggests adverse effects of spinosad to energy production and metabolism and thus negative consequences on foraging. Together, our study indicates that spinosad causes adverse effects at environmentally realistic concentrations, which may pose a risk to bee populations. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.06.013,378,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067047889&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.06.013&partnerID=40&md5=f68712a866c4f5d0606542d373257fce,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,68

This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/ŒºL of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut.

TMX and other neonicotinoids are reported to be potential causes of honey bee decline. Due to its systematic action, TMX may be recovered in pollen, bee bread, nectar, and honey, which make bees likely to be exposed to contaminated diet. In this study, we used immunolabeling to demonstrate that sublethal concentrations of TMX decrease the protein levels of synapsin in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and the antennal lobes (ALs) of pupae and newly emerged worker bees that were exposed through the food to TMX during the larval phase. A decrease in the synapsin level was observed in the MBs of pupae previously exposed to 0.001 and 1.44 ng/¬µL and in newly emerged bees previously exposed to 1.44 ng/¬µL and no changes were observed in the optical lobes (OLs). In the ALs, the decrease was observed in pupae and newly emerged bees exposed to 1.44 ng/¬µL. Because the MBs and ALs are brain structures involved in stimuli reception, learning, and memory consolidation and because synapsin is important for the regulation of neurotransmitter release, we hypothesize that exposure to sublethal concentrations of TMX during the larval stage may cause neurophysiological disorders in honey bees. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.11.048,169,,523,528,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056819414&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.11.048&partnerID=40&md5=b2de92bf068a1cbab18fb4514594a35a,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,70

The abundance and diversity of honeybees have been rapidly diminishing, possibly related to the extensive use of insecticides in ecosystems. Sulfoxaflor is a novel sulfoximine insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. However, few studies have addressed the negative effects of sulfoxaflor on honeybees at environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, adult workers were fed a 50% (w/v) of sugar solution containing different concentrations (0, 0.05, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor for two weeks consecutively. The survival rates, food intake, and body weight of the honeybees significantly decreased after continuous exposure at higher doses (0.5 and 2.0 mg/L) of sulfoxaflor when compared with the control. The change in the metabolites in the honeybee gut was determined using high-throughput non-targeted metabolomics on day 14 after sulfoxaflor treatment. The results revealed that 24 and 105 metabolites changed after exposure to 0.5 and 2.0 mg/L sulfoxaflor, respectively, compared with that of the control groups. A total of 12 changed compounds including pregenolone and glutathione were detected as potential biomarkers, which were eventually found to be enriched in pathways of the steroid hormone biosynthesis (p = 0.0001) and glutathione metabolism (p = 0.021).

One of the most widely used classes of insecticides are neonicotinoids that interfere with signalling of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, but these can also disrupt crop-pollination services provided by bees. Here, we analysed whether chronic low dose long-term exposure to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam alters gene expression and alternative splicing in brains of Africanized honey bees, Apis mellifera, as adaptation to altered neuronal signalling. We find differentially regulated genes that show concentration-dependent responses to thiamethoxam, but no changes in alternative splicing. Most differentially expressed genes have no annotated function but encode short Open Reading Frames, a characteristic feature of anti-microbial peptides. As this suggested that immune responses may be compromised by thiamethoxam exposure, we tested the impact of thiamethoxam on bee immunity by injecting bacteria. We show that intrinsically sub-lethal thiamethoxam exposure makes bees more vulnerable to normally non-pathogenic bacteria.

This is critical for understanding their responses to, and defenses against, a variety of environmental stresses, including agrochemicals. Therefore, we studied the detoxification and immune responses of a stingless bee, Nanotrigona perilampoides, which is an important stingless bee that is widely distributed throughout Mexico, including urban areas, and has the potential to be used in commercial pollination. We first determined the LC50 of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid for foragers of N. perilampoides, then chronically exposed bees for 10 days to imidacloprid at two field-realistic concentrations, LC10 (0.45 ng/¬µL) or LC20 (0.74 ng/¬µL), which are respectively 2.7 and 1.3-fold lower than the residues of imidacloprid that have been found in honey (6 ng/g) in central Mexico. We found that exposing N. perilampoides stingless bees to imidacloprid at these concentrations markedly reduced bee survival and food consumption, revealing the great sensitivity of this stingless bee to the insecticide in comparison to honey bees. The expression of detoxification (GSTD1) and immune-related genes (abaecin, defensin1, and hymenopteacin) in N. perilampoides also changed over time in response to imidacloprid. Gene expression was always lower in bees after 8 days of exposure to imidacloprid (LC10 or LC20) than it was after 4 days. Our results demonstrate that N. perilampoides stingless bees are extremely sensitive to imidacloprid, even at low concentrations, and provide greater insight into how stingless bees respond to pesticide toxicity.

Multiple factors like parasites, pathogens and pesticides are dealt as possible drivers of honeybee losses. In particular, insecticides are considered as a major factor of pollinator poisoning. We applied sublethal concentrations of four insecticidal substances to honeybee larval food and analyzed the effects on transcriptome. The aim was to identify candidate genes indicating early negative impacts after application of insecticidal substances. Honeybee larvae were kept in-vitro under hive conditions (34‚Äì35 ¬∞C) and fed with dimethoate, fenoxycarb, chlorantraniliprole and flupyradifurone in sublethal concentrations between day 3‚Äì6 after grafting.

By use of a RT-qPCR array differences in gene expression of selected gene families (immune system, development detoxification) were measured.

However, it also simultaneously has adverse effects on the health of important pollinators, such as honey bees. Previous studies have reported that sublethal doses of neonicotinoids impaired immunocompetence, learning and memory performance, and homing behaviour in honey bees. In the present study, using LC-MS-based combined with GC‚ÄìMS-based metabolomic approaches, we profiled the metabolic changes that occur in the head of honey bee after subchronic exposure to 2 mg/L thiacloprid over 3 days. The estimated total dose of thiacloprid fed to each bee was 0.12 Œºg. The results showed that there were 115 metabolites significantly affected in thiacloprid-treated bees compared to control. The metabolites with high level of abundance enriched to wide range pathways associated with oxidative stress and detoxification suggest that the honey bees have activated their detoxification system to resistant toxicity of thiacloprid.

A major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study. We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal that genes involved in important biological processes including mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than queens.

As agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, they disturb acetylcholine receptor signaling leading to neurotoxicity. Several behavioral studies showed the link between neonicotinoid exposure and adverse effects on foraging activity and reproduction. However, molecular effects underlying these effects are poorly understood. Here we elucidated molecular effects at environmental realistic levels of three neonicotinoids and nicotine, and compared laboratory studies to field exposures with acetamiprid. We assessed transcriptional alterations of eight selected genes in caged honey bees exposed to different concentrations of the neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloporid, and thiamethoxam, as well as nicotine. We determined transcripts of several targets, including nicotinic acetylcholine receptor Œ± 1 and Œ± 2 subunit, the multifunctional gene vitellogenin, immune system genes apidaecin and defensin-1, stress-related gene catalase and two genes linked to memory formation, pka and creb. Vitellogenin showed a strong increase upon neonicotinoid exposures in the laboratory and field, while creb and pka transcripts were down-regulated. The induction of vitellogenin suggests adverse effects on foraging activity, whereas creb and pka down-regulation may be implicated in decreased long-term memory formation.

Recent research provided evidence that interactions between ecological stressors are drivers of declining pollinator health and responsible for observed population collapses. We used the honeybee Apis mellifera and conducted a series of experiments to test for long-term effects of a single short exposure to the agricultural pesticide flupyradifurone to a second environmental stressor later in life. To do this, we exposed individuals during their larval development or early adulthood to sublethal dosages of flupyradifurone (0.025 mu g for larvae and 0.645 mu g for imagos), either pure or as part of an agricultural formulation (Sivanto). We afterwards exposed bees to a second ecological stressor infecting individuals with 10,000 spores of the fungal gut parasite Nosema ceranae. We found that pesticide exposures significantly reduced survival of bees and altered the expression of several immune and detoxification genes. The ability of bees to respond to these latter effects differed significantly between colonies, offering opportunities to breed bees with elevated levels of pesticide tolerance in the future.

Recently, much attention has been directed toward the safety of pesticides to bees. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a new butenolide insecticide and is considered friendly to honey bee fitness according to risk assessment procedures. Although no significant side-effects on bee colony strength parameters at FPF field-realistic concentration, laboratory experiments have demonstrated that FPF has multiple negative effects on the behavior of individual honey bees. The information suggested that FPF is posing potential risks to honey bees. In this study, we found that the survival rate of bees exposed to FPF was statistically significantly reduced, whereas there were no negative effects on larvae development nor foraging activity. In addition, immune- and detoxification-related genes were upregulated in exposed foragers and newly emerged bees, suggesting that more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future. Flupyradifurone (FPF) is a novel systemic nAChR agonist that interferes with signal transduction in the central nervous system of sucking pests. Despite claims that FPF is potentially ""bee-safe"" by risk assessments, laboratory data have suggested that FPF has multiple sub-lethal effects on individual honey bees. Our study aimed to expand the studies to the effects of field-realistic concentration of FPF. We found a statistically significant decrease in the survival rate of honey bees exposed to FPF, whereas there were no significantly negative effects on larvae development durations nor foraging activity. In addition, we found that the exposed foragers showed significantly higher expression of ApidNT, CYP9Q2, CYP9Q3, and AmInR-2 compared to the CK group (control group), but no alteration in the gene expression was observed in larvae. The exposed newly emerged bees showed significantly higher expression of Defensin and ApidNT. These results indicate that the chronic exposure to the field-realistic concentration of FPF has negligible effects, but more important synergistic and behavioral effects that can affect colony fitness should be explored in the future, considering the wide use of FPF on crops pollinated and visited by honey bees.",2021/04//,2021,10.3390/insects12040357,12,4,,,,,,2075-4450,WOS:000643078900001,,0,,1,80

565,JOUR,Transcriptomic Responses Underlying the High Virulence of Black Queen Cell Virus and Sacbrood Virus following a Change in Their Mode of Transmission in Honey Bees (Apis mellifera),"Al Naggar, Y.; Shafiey, H.; Paxton, R.J.",Viruses,"Background: Over the last two decades, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have suffered high rates of colony losses that have been attributed to a variety of factors, chief among which are viral pathogens, such as deformed wing virus (DWV), whose virulence has increased because of vector-based transmission by the invasive, ectoparasitic varroa mite (Varroa destructor). A shift in the experimental mode of transmission of the black queen cell virus (BQCV) and sacbrood virus (SBV) from fecal/food‚Äìoral (direct horizontal) to vector-mediated (indirect horizontal) transmission also results in high virulence and viral titers in pupal and adult honey bees. Agricultural pesticides represent another factor that acts independently or in interaction with pathogens, and they are also thought to cause colony loss. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the higher virulence following a vector-based mode of transmission provides deeper insight into honey bee colony losses, as does determining whether or not host‚Äìpathogen interactions are modulated by exposure to pesticides. Methods: Through an experimental design with controlled laboratory, we investigated the effects of the modes of transmission of BQCV and SBV (feeding vs. vector-mediated via injection) alone or in combination with chronic exposure to sublethal and field-realistic concentrations of flupyradifurone (FPF), a novel agricultural insecticide, on honey bee survival and transcription responses by using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Results: Co-exposure to viruses via feeding (VF) or injection (VI) and FPF insecticide had no statistically significant interactive effect on their survival compared to, respectively, VF or VI treatments alone. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a distinct difference in the gene expression profiles of bees inoculated with viruses via injection (VI) and exposed to FPF insecticide (VI+FPF). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at log2 (fold-change) > 2.0 in VI bees (136 genes) or/and VI+FPF insecticide (282 genes) was very high compared to that of VF bees (8 genes) or the VF+FPF insecticide treatment (15 genes). Of these DEGs, the expression in VI and VI+FPF bees of some immune-related genes, such as those for antimicrobial peptides, Ago2, and Dicer, was induced. In short, several genes encoding odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, odor receptors, honey bee venom peptides, and vitellogenin were downregulated in VI and VI+FPF bees. Conclusions: Given the importance of these suppressed genes in honey bees‚Äô innate immunity, eicosanoid biosynthesis, and olfactory associative function, their inhibition because of the change in the mode of infection with BQCV and SBV to vector-mediated transmission (injection into haemocoel) could explain the high virulence observed in these viruses when they were experimentally injected into hosts. These changes may help explain why other viruses, such as DWV, represent such a threat to colony survival when transmitted by varroa mites. ¬© 2023 by the authors.",2023,2023,10.3390/v15061284,15,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164183287&doi=10.3390%2fv15061284&partnerID=40&md5=7a305c1cb5a3c0f6225491b522e1c948,,antiviral response; antivirus agent; Apis mellifera; Article; bioinformatics; biosynthesis; Black queen cell virus; BQCV; deformed wing virus; differential gene expression; down regulation; experimental design; feeding; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene ontology; genetic analysis; genetic transcription; hemolymph; high throughput sequencing; honeybee; honeybee venom; host pathogen interaction; immune response; immune-related gene; innate immunity; long term exposure; mite; nonhuman; olfactory receptor; pesticide; plant pathogen interaction; prevalence; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA interference; RNA sequence; RNA sequencing; RNAi; sacbrood virus; SBV; scientific literature; single nucleotide polymorphism; transcriptome; transcriptomics; upregulation; virulence; virus load; virus transmission; virus virulence; whole cell patch clamp,,0,,1,82

However, traditional environmental risk assessment is only carried out based on ecotoxicological data of single substances. In this context, we aimed to explore the potential effects when worker honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were simultaneously challenged by thiamethoxam (TMX) and flusilazole (FSZ). Results displayed that TMX possessed higher toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 0.11 mg a. i. L‚àí1) than FSZ (96-h LC50 value of 738 mg a. i. L‚àí1). Furthermore, the mixture of TMX and FSZ exhibited an acute synergistic impact on the pollinators. Meanwhile, the activities of SOD, caspase 3, caspase 9, and PPO, as well as the expressions of six genes (abaecin, dorsal-2, defensin-2, vtg, caspase-1, and CYP6AS14) associated with oxidative stress, immune response, lifespan, cell apoptosis, and detoxification metabolism were noteworthily varied in the individual and mixture challenges than at the baseline level. These data revealed that it is imminently essential to investigate the combined toxicity of pesticides since the toxicity evaluation from individual compounds toward honey bees may underestimate the toxicity in realistic conditions.

Here, we analyse transcriptional effects in the brain of honey bees of three frequently applied fungicides, azoxystrobin, chlorothanolin and folpet, after oral exposure for 24, 48 and 72 h. Among transcripts assessed were genes encoding proteins for immune and hormone system regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism, and acetylcholine receptor alpha 1. Azoxystrobin and folpet induced minor alterations, including down-regulation of hbg-3 by azoxystrobin and induction of ndufb-7 by folpet. Chlorothanolin induced strong transcriptional down-regulation of genes encoding enzymes related to oxidative phosphorylation and metabolism, including cyp9q1, cyp9q2 and cyp9q3, acetylcholine receptor alpha 1 and hbg-3 and ilp-1, which are linked to hormonal regulation and behavioural transition of honey bees. Exposures to chlorothanolin in different seasonal times showed different responsiveness; responses were faster and often stronger in April than in June. Chlorothanolin caused the strongest effects and affected transcriptional abundance of genes related to energy production, metabolism and the endocrine system. Disturbed energy production may reduce foraging activity and hormonal dysregulation, such as the transition of nurse bees to foragers. Further analyses are needed to further substantiate potential adverse effects of chlorothanolin in bees on the physiological level. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.05.056,377,,,,215,226,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066407211&doi=10.1016%2fj.jhazmat.2019.05.056&partnerID=40&md5=272b3bae63602b29953dc8c62bf32295,Scopus,,,0,,1,84

(1) Background: Cognitive abilities are vital for the functional maintenance of honey bees; however, it remains unknown if chronic, low-dose exposure to thiacloprid during the larval stage impairs the cognitive abilities of emerged adult honey bees. (2) Methods: To explore this question, honey bee larvae were fed 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/L thiacloprid during their developmental phase. Then, the cognitive (i.e., olfactory learning and memory) abilities of adult honey bees were quantified to assess the delayed impacts of early-stage thiacloprid exposure on adult honey bee cognition. Neural apoptosis and transcriptomic level were also evaluated to explore the neurological mechanisms underlying these effects. (3) Results: Our results revealed that chronic larval exposure to sublethal thiacloprid impaired the learning and memory abilities of adult honey bees by inducing neuronal apoptosis and transcriptomic alterations.

Here we assessed expressional alteration of marker genes indicative of endocrine effects in the brain of honey bees. We exposed foragers to chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and thiacloprid and assessed the expression of genes after exposure for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Chlorpyrifos caused the strongest expressional changes at 24 h characterized by induction of vitellogenin, major royal jelly protein (mrjp) 2 and 3, insulin-like peptide (ilp1), alpha-glucosidase (hbg3) and sima, and down-regulation of buffy. Cypermethrin caused minor induction of mrjp1, mrjp2, mmp1 and ilp1. The sima transcript showed down-regulation at 48 h and up-regulation at 72 h. Exposure to thiacloprid caused down-regulation of vitellogenin, mrjp1 and sima at 24 h, and hbg3 at 72 h, as well as induction of ilp1 at 48 h. The buffy transcript was down-regulated at 24 h and up-regulated at 48 h. Despite compound-specific expression patterns, each insecticide altered the expression of some of the suggested endocrine system related genes. Our study suggests that expressional changes of genes prominently expressed in nurse or forager bees, including down-regulation of buffy and mrjps and up-regulation of hbg3 and ilp1 may serve as indicators for endocrine activity of insecticides in foragers. ¬© 2020 The Author(s)",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.127542,260,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087994439&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.127542&partnerID=40&md5=912aab386241a2ac1cca26288c43f5fe,Scopus,"['adult', 'alpha glucosidase', 'Alpha glucosidase', 'animal', 'animal tissue', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apis mellifera carnica', 'Apoidea', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'brain', 'Brain', 'brain tissue', 'buffy gene', 'chlorpyrifos', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'cypermethrin', 'Cypermethrin', 'Cypermethrins', 'down regulation', 'Down-regulation', 'drug effect', 'ecdysone receptor', 'Endocrine activity', 'Endocrine effects', 'endocrine system', 'Endocrine System', 'Endocrine systems', 'Expression patterns', 'Food products', 'forager', 'foraging', 'gene', 'gene expression', 'Gene expression', 'Genes', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic transcription', 'high performance liquid chromatography', 'Honey bees', 'honeybee', 'induced response', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'insulin like peptide 1', 'interstitial collagenase', 'major royal jelly protein 2', 'major royal jelly protein 3', 'Major royal jelly proteins', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'neuropeptide', 'nonhuman', 'physiology', 'protein', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'real time polymerase chain reaction', 'reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction', 'RNA extraction', 'RNA isolation', 'sima protein', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'unclassified drug', 'upregulation', 'vitellogenin', 'Vitellogenins']",,0,,1,86

Despite many studies have revealed that the most important Chinese indigenous speciesÔºåApis cerana, is presenting a high risk on exposure to neonicotinoids, the toxicology information on Apis cerana remain limited. This study was aimed to determine the acute and chronic toxic effects of thiacloprid (IUPAC name: {(2Z)-3-[(6-Chloro-3-pyridinyl)methyl]-1,3-thiazolidin-2-ylidene}cyanamide) on behavioral and physiological performance as well as genome-wide transcriptome in A. cerana. We found the 1/5 LC50 of thiacloprid significantly impaired learning and memory abilities after both acute and chronic exposure, nevertheless, has no effects on the sucrose responsiveness and phototaxis climbing ability of A. cerana. Moreover, activities of detoxification enzyme P450 monooxygenases and CarE were increased by short-term exposure to thiacloprid, while prolonged exposure caused suppression of CarE activity. Neither acute nor chronic exposure to thiacloprid altered honey bee AChE activities. To further study the potential defense molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress, we analyzed the transcriptomes of honeybees in response to thiacloprid stress. The transcriptomic profiles revealed consistent upregulation of immune- and stress-related genes by both acute or chronic treatments. Our results suggest that the chronic exposure to thiacloprid produced greater toxic effects than a single administration to A. cerana. Altogether, our study deepens the understanding of the toxicological characteristic of A. cerana against thiacloprid, and could be used to further investigate the complex molecular mechanisms in Asian honey bee under pesticide stress. ¬© 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.pestbp.2023.105483,194,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161501190&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2023.105483&partnerID=40&md5=7a0758e2382dfbe1da33329c17987950,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'thiacloprid', 'Thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'genetics', 'Detoxification', 'Apis cerana', 'Transcriptome analysis']",,,,0,detox,1,87
328,JOUR,Binary mixtures of neonicotinoids show different transcriptional changes than single neonicotinoids in honeybees (Apis mellifera),"['Christen, V.', 'Bachofer, S.', 'Fent, K.']",Environmental Pollution,"Among the many factors responsible for the decline of bee populations are plant protection products such as neonicotinoids. In general, bees are exposed to not only one but mixtures of such chemicals. At environmental realistic concentrations neonicotinoids may display negative effects on the immune system, foraging activity, learning and memory formation of bees. Neonicotinoids induce alterations of gene transcripts such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits, vitellogenin, genes of the immune system and genes linked to memory formation. While previous studies focused on individual compounds, the effect of neonicotinoid mixtures in bees is poorly known. Here we investigated the effects of neonicotinoids acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam as single compounds, and binary mixtures thereof in honeybees. We determined transcriptional changes of nAChR subunits and vitellogenin in the brain of experimentally exposed honeybees after exposure up to 72¬†h. Exposure concentrations were selected on the basis of lowest effect concentrations of the single compounds. Transcriptional induction of nAChRs and vitellogenin was strongest for thiamethoxam, and weakest for acetamiprid. To a large extent, binary mixtures did not show additive transcriptional inductions but they were less than additive. Our data suggest that the joint transcriptional activity of neonicotinoids cannot be explained by concentration addition. The in¬†vivo effects are not only governed by agonistic interaction with nAChRs alone, but are more complex as a result of interactions with other pathways as well. Further studies are needed to investigate the physiological joint effects of mixtures of neonicotinoids and other plant protection products on bees to better understand their joint effects. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017///,2017,10.1016/j.envpol.2016.10.105,220,,1264,1270,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84999648368&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2016.10.105&partnerID=40&md5=a474edd83a460346afb01361a49d6299,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,88

The herbicide Glyphosate and the insecticide Imidacloprid are among the most used pesticides worldwide, although different studies evidenced their detrimental effects on non-target organisms. The emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds and the recent ban of imidacloprid in Europe due to safety concerns, has prompted their replacement by new molecules, such as glufosinate-ammonium (GA) and sulfoxaflor (S). GA is a broad-spectrum and non-selective herbicide that inhibits a key enzyme in the metabolism of nitrogen, causing accumulation of lethal levels of ammonia; while sulfoxaflor is an agonist at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and generates excitatory responses including tremors, paralysis and mortality. Although those molecules are being increasingly used for crop protection, little is known about their effects on non-target organisms. In this study we assessed the impact of chronic and acute exposure to sublethal doses of GA and S on honey bee gut microbiota, immunity and survival. We found GA significantly reduced the number of gut bacteria, and decreased the expression of glucose oxidase, a marker of social immunity. On the other hand, S significantly increased the number of gut bacteria altering the microbiota composition, decreased the expression of lysozyme and increased the expression of hymenoptaecin. These alterations in gut microbiota and immunocompetence may lead to an increased susceptibility to pathogens. Finally, both pesticides shortened honey bee survival and increased the risk of death. Those results evidence the negative impact of GA and S on honey bees, even at single exposition to a low dose, and provide useful information to the understanding of pollinators decline. ¬© 2022",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.161331,868,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146540349&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.161331&partnerID=40&md5=a03515a9e14c5ba0807878b92627c4fd,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'nicotinic receptor', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'survival', 'Imidacloprids', 'sublethal dose', 'lifespan', 'Honey bee', 'gene expression', 'short term exposure', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'down regulation', 'long term exposure', 'unclassified drug', 'Weed control', 'protein expression', 'Sublethal dose', 'immune system', 'Immune system', 'immunity', 'intestine flora', 'Non-target organism', 'bioaccumulation', 'glucose oxidase', 'Glucose', 'animal health', 'lysozyme', 'Bacteria', 'bacterium', 'crop protection', 'nitrogen', 'Gut microbiota', 'Gut bacteria', 'Ammonia', 'ammonium', 'Glucose oxidase', 'Glucose sensors', 'glufosinate', 'Glufosinate', 'Glufosinate-ammonium', 'immunocompetence', 'Molecules', 'nitrogen metabolism', 'phosphinothricin']",,,,0,,1,91

Fungicides are authorized for use during crop blooms because of their low acute toxicity to honey bees. Thus, a bee that might have been previously exposed to pesticides through contaminated food may be subjected to fungicide spraying when it initiates its first flight outside the hive. In this study, we assessed the effects of acute exposure to the fungicide in bees with different toxicological statuses. Three days after emergence, bees were subjected to chronic exposure to the insecticide imidacloprid and the herbicide glyphosate, either individually or in a binary mixture, at environmental concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 Œºg/L in food (0.0083 and 0.083 Œºg/kg) for 30 days. Seven days after the beginning of chronic exposure to the pesticides (10 days after emergence), the bees were subjected to spraying with the fungicide difenoconazole at the registered field dosage. The results showed a delayed significant decrease in survival when honey bees were treated with the fungicide. Fungicide toxicity increased when honey bees were chronically exposed to glyphosate at the lowest concentration, decreased when they were exposed to imidacloprid, and did not significantly change when they were exposed to the binary mixture regardless of the concentration. Bees exposed to all of these pesticide combinations showed physiological disruptions, revealed by the modulation of several life history traits related mainly to metabolism, even when no effect of the other pesticides on fungicide toxicity was observed.

In our experiments, the duration of honeybee imbibing food at the feeder declined and the returning period from the feeder to the hive increased in both insecticide groups compared with the control group. As a follow-up, we performed a deep RNA-seq analysis to reveal the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying this altered foraging performance. Genes involved in detoxification were upregulated in both the imidacloprid and the deltamethrin-treatment groups. Gene members in immune pathways, odorant receptors and major royal jelly protein families were significantly downregulated in the treatment groups compared with the controls. This fluctuating gene expression profile shows that multifaceted aspects of honeybee physiology were affected by the two insecticides, which may lead to inaccurate communication and impaired learning and memory. Our findings reveal candidate molecular mechanisms leading to impaired dance performance in honeybees exposed to insecticides.",2022/11//,2022,10.1111/jen.13061,146,9,1169,1177,,,"['imidacloprid', 'foraging behavior', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'gene expression', 'brain', 'transcriptome', 'Apis mellifera L.', 'detoxification', 'United States', 'insecticides', 'genetic analysis', 'deltamethrin']",0931-2048,WOS:000840470800001,,0,,1,93

Numerous studies have been conducted to demonstrate the risks associated with neonicotinoid pesticides, but research on their occurrence in actual field conditions has not been identified. Therefore, in this study, we observed changes in honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies located near rice cultivation areas as they progressed beyond the rice pesticide application period. Furthermore, we collected honey bees exposed to the clothianidin and analyzed their stress-related gene expression. The results showed that the foraging behavior of honey bee colonies located near rice cultivation areas did not exhibit significant differences between the treatment sites (Cheongyang and Gimje) and the control site (Wanju) during the experimental period. However, it was observed that the expression levels of stress-related genes in honey bees collected from the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control. Most of the stress-related genes were associated with detoxification processes in response to pesticides. As a result, pesticide treatment in proximity to rice cultivation areas did not cause direct damage to honey bees but had an indirect impact, suggesting the potential for ongoing chronic damage. ¬© 2023 by the authors.",2023///,2023,10.3390/d15121217,15,12,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180678988&doi=10.3390%2fd15121217&partnerID=40&md5=ef59a1c641f8da6c341f8c98a47560b5,Scopus,"['neonicotinoid pesticide', 'clothianidin', 'honeybee', 'toxicity', 'colony', 'neonicotinoids', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'honey bees', 'colony strength', 'paddy field', 'qRT PCR', 'rice field', 'South Korea', 'toxicity stress genes']",,,,0,,1,94

The present study aims to evaluate the impact of these two insecticides on the development of the HPGs and on the survival of Apis mellifera intermissa a native African subspecies of honey bee present in Algeria. Newly emerged workers were acutely and chronically exposed to thiamethoxam and spinosad through sugar syrup and pollen pastry. The effects of these insecticides were assessed by measuring the size of HPGs acini and the total head protein content. The survival of the workers was also evaluated over 60 days when they were chronically exposed to the insecticides at concentrations corresponding to LC25 and LC10. We found that the insecticide-treated workers, after both acute and chronic exposure, exhibited smaller and irregularly shaped HPG acini. The total head protein content also decreased in treated individuals with the two concentrations of insecticides at day 6 and 9 compared to the respective controls. While the control group exhibited an LC25 (i.e. the time needed to kill 50% of the tested workers) of 22 days, the LC25 was only 3 days for the workers exposed to the LC25 of spinosad and all workers were dead at day 17. In contrast, thiamethoxam exposure at LC25 had no significant detrimental effect on honey bee survival.

Experiments were performed under laboratory conditions on adult workers collected from hives in February (winter bees) and July (summer bees) and revealed season-dependent changes in the bacterial community composition. N. ceranae and a lethal fipronil treatment increased the relative abundance of both Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi in surviving winter honeybees. The parasite and a sublethal exposure to all insecticides decreased the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. regardless of the season.

Exposure to these neurotoxins may be a major contributor to poor honey bee colony health. Few studies have explored how sub lethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee metabolic physiology, including nutritional and energetic homeostasis, both of which are important for maintaining colony health. Reported here are results from a study of chronic oral exposure of honey bees to two sub lethal concentrations of clothianidin and imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids altered important aspects of honey bee nutritional and metabolic physiology in a compound and dose-dependent manner; both compounds at low doses reduced honey bee body weight. Low-dose clothianidin exposure resulted in bees having protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and glycogen levels similar to newly emerged bees. High-dose clothianidin exposure lowered lipids and glycogen content of bees. High-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees having depressed metabolic rate. Low-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees consuming low and high levels of protein and carbohydrate rich foods, respectively. Results suggest neonicotinoids interfere with honey bee endocrine neurophysiological pathways. Compound and dose-dependent effects might represent respective chemical structural differences determining an observed effect, and thresholds of compound effects on honey bee physiology. ¬© 2019 by the author.

Here we exposed honey bee colonies during three brood generations to sub-lethal doses of a widely used pesticide, imidacloprid, and then subsequently challenged newly emerged bees with the gut parasite, Nosema spp. The pesticide dosages used were below levels demonstrated to cause effects on longevity or foraging in adult honey bees. Nosema infections increased significantly in the bees from pesticide-treated hives when compared to bees from control hives demonstrating an indirect effect of pesticides on pathogen growth in honey bees. We clearly demonstrate an increase in pathogen growth within individual bees reared in colonies exposed to one of the most widely used pesticides worldwide, imidacloprid, at below levels considered harmful to bees. The finding that individual bees with undetectable levels of the target pesticide, after being reared in a sub-lethal pesticide environment within the colony, had higher Nosema is significant.

This defense can be weakened by environmental factors that may render honey bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Honey bees are frequently exposed to neonicotinoid pesticides, which are being discussed as one of the stress factors that may lead to colony failure. We investigated the sublethal effects of the neonicotinoids thiacloprid, imidacloprid, and clothianidin on individual immunity, by studying three major aspects of immunocompetence in worker bees: total hemocyte number, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph. In laboratory experiments, we found a strong impact of all three neonicotinoids. Thiacloprid (24 h oral exposure, 200 Œºg/l or 2000. Œºg/l) and imidacloprid (1 Œºg/l or 10 Œºg/l) reduced hemocyte density, encapsulation response, and antimicrobial activity even at field realistic concentrations. Clothianidin had an effect on these immune parameters only at higher than field realistic concentrations (50-200 Œºg/l).

One of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Although the primary mode of action of imidacloprid is on the insect nervous system, it has also been shown to cause changes in insects' digestive physiology and alter the microbiota of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The honey bee gut microbiome plays a major role in bee health. Although many studies have shown that imidacloprid affects honey bee behavior, its impact on the microbiome has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the impact of imidacloprid on the gut microbiome composition, survivorship, and susceptibility to pathogens of honey bees. Consistent with other studies, we show that imidacloprid exposure results in an elevated mortality of honey bees in the hive and increases the susceptibility to infection by pathogens. However, we did not find evidence that imidacloprid affects the gut bacterial community of honey bees. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that honey bee gut bacteria can grow in the presence of imidacloprid, and we found some evidence that imidacloprid can be metabolized in the bee gut environment. However, none of the individual bee gut bacterial species tested could metabolize imidacloprid, suggesting that the observed metabolism of imidacloprid within in vitro bee gut cultures is not caused by the gut bacteria. Overall, our results indicate that imidacloprid causes increased mortality in honey bees, but this mortality does not appear to be linked to the microbiome. ¬© 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",2018///,2018,10.1128/AEM.00545-18,84,13,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049378480&doi=10.1128%2fAEM.00545-18&partnerID=40&md5=194e8ae4e1486d395f126789a311f728,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,100
95,JOUR,Detrimental interactions of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and bumblebee immunity,"['Czerwinski, MA', 'Sadd, B']",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY,"Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects. However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators. Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking. In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received 6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally, imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure and pathogens.",2017/06/01/,2017,10.1002/jez.2087,327,5,273,283,,,,2471-5638,WOS:000412084100007,,0,,1,101

However, the contribution of the honey bee gut microbiota to host detoxification ability has yet to be investigated. In order to address this question, we compared the expression of cytochrome P450s (P450s) genes between gut microbiota deficient (GD) workers and conventional gut community (CV) workers and compared the mortality rates and the pesticide residue levels of GD and CV workers treated with thiacloprid or tau-fluvalinate. Our results showed that gut microbiota promotes the expression of P450 enzymes in the midgut, and the mortality rate and pesticide residue levels of GD workers are significantly higher than those of CV workers. Further comparisons between tetracycline-treated workers and untreated workers demonstrated that antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis leads to attenuated expression of P450s in the midgut. The co-treatment of antibiotics and pesticides leads to reduced survival rate and a significantly higher amount of pesticide residues in honey bees. Taken together, our results demonstrated that honey bee gut symbiont could contribute to bee health through the modification of the host xenobiotics detoxification pathways and revealed a potential negative impact of antibiotics to honey bee detoxification ability and health. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, this study investigated the sublethal effects of imidacloprid, pyraclostrobin, and glyphosate on the behavior and fat body cells of S. postica. Pesticide ingestion decreased the walking distance and mean velocity of bees compared to the control and solvent control groups. The oenocytes of the control groups were spherical, with central nuclei containing decondensed chromatin, and the trophocytes presented irregular morphology, with cells varying in shape and the cytoplasm filled with vacuoles and granules. However, bees exposed to pesticides showed extensive cytoarchitectural disruption in the fat body, such as vacuolization and shape changes in oenocytes and altered nuclei morphology in trophocytes. Moreover, pesticide exposure increased the number of atypical oenocytes and altered trophocytes, except for the PYR group, which showed a lower number of atypical oenocytes. Caspase-positive labeling significantly increased in all exposed bee groups. Alternatively, TLR4 labeling was significantly decreased in the exposed groups compared to the control groups. There was a significant increase in HSP90 immunolabeling in all exposed groups compared to the control.

The present work aimed at understanding the synergistic effects on honeybees of a combined inhive exposure to sublethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and the fungicide penconazole. A multidisciplinary approach was used: honeybee mortality upon exposure was initially tested in cage, and the colonies development monitored. Morphological and ultrastructural analyses via light and transmission electron microscopy were carried out on the gut of larvae and forager honeybees. Moreover, the main pollen foraging sources and the fungal gut microbiota were studied using Next Generation Sequencing; the gut core bacterial taxa were quantified via qPCR. The mortality test showed a negative effect on honeybee survival when exposed to agrochemicals and their mixture in cage but not confirmed at colony level. Microscopy analyses on the gut epithelium indicated no appreciable morphological changes in larvae, newly emerged and forager honeybees exposed in field to the agrochemicals. Nevertheless, the gut microbial profile showed a reduction of Bombilactobacillus and an increase of Lactobacillus and total fungi upon mixture application. Finally, we highlighted for the first time a significant honeybee diet change after pesticide exposure: penconazole, alone or in mixture, significantly altered the pollen foraging preference, with honeybees preferring Hedera pollen.

However, the latter was assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be applied to flowering crops. In this study, we assessed the impacts of these two pesticides on queenless microcolonies and the gut microbiota of Bombus terrestris. We found that 10 mu g/L imidacloprid significantly impeded syrup consumption, and post-poned the egg-laying period, larvae, and pupae development. It decreased the relative abundance of the bumblebee-specific symbionts, Apibacter and Lactobacillus Firm-5. On the contrary, 10 mu g/L flupyradifurone did not reduce syrup consumption, block larvae and pupae development in bumble-bees. Although no significant phenotypes were observed, PICRUST revealed that flupyradifurone suppressed pathways, involving carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, translation, and membrane transport. Our findings suggest the appropriate use of this new pesticide may be considered safe for bumblebees, but the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation.",2022/03//,2022,10.3390/agriculture12030389,12,3,,,,,"['Microcolony', 'Imidacloprid', 'Flupyradifurone', 'Gut microbiota', 'B. terrestris']",2077-0472,WOS:000776898300001,,0,,1,106

Large-scale transcriptome approaches were applied to determine the changes in global gene expression in the brains of newly emerged honeybees after carbendazim exposure during the larval stage. To further understand the effects of carbendazim on the brain development of honeybees, the functions of differentially expressed genes were compared between the treatment and control groups. We found that neuroregulatory genes were down-regulated after carbendazim exposure, which suggest the neurotoxic effects of this fungicide on honeybee nervous system. Carbendazim exposure also altered the expression of genes implicated in metabolism, transport, sensor, and hormone. Notably, larvae in the carbendazim-treated group observed longer time to shift into the dormant pupal state than the control group. Moreover, a low juvenile hormone and high ecdysone titers were found in the treatment group compared to control group.

However, most research has focused on honeybees, leaving a significant gap in studies concerning native species, particularly regarding the impacts of pesticide combinations on these pollinators. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the sublethal effects of imidacloprid (IMD), pyraclostrobin (PYR), and glyphosate (GLY) on the behavior and fat body cell morphology and physiology of M. scutellaris . Foragers were orally exposed to the different pesticides alone and in combination for 48 h. Bees fed with contaminated solution walked less, moved slower, presented morphological changes in the fat body, including vacuolization, altered cell shape and nuclei morphology, and exhibited a higher count of altered oenocytes and trophocytes. In all exposed groups, alone and in combination, the number of cells expressing caspase-3 increased, but the TLR4 number of cells expressing decreased compared to the control groups. The intensity of HSP70 immunolabeling increased compared to the control groups. However, the intensity of the immunolabeling of HSP90 decreased in the IMD, GLY, and I + G (IMD + GLY) groups but increased in I +P -exposed bees (IMD + PYR). Alternatively, exposure to PYR and P + G (PYR + GLY) did not affect the immunolabeling intensity.

Middle-aged honeybees were fed with 50% (w/v) sucrose solution containing 0, 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg/L thiacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide) for up to 13 days, and on each day of exposure experiment, percentage survival, sucrose consumption, and bodyweight of honeybees were measured. Further, changes in honeybee gut microbial community were examined using next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing on day 1, 7, and 13 of the exposure. When compared to control-treatment, continuous exposure to high (0.6 mg/L) and very high (2.0 mg/L) concentrations of thiacloprid significantly reduced percentage survival of honeybees (p < 0.001) and led to dysbiosis of their gut microbial community on day 7 of the exposure. However, during subsequent developmental stages of middle-aged honeybees (i.e. on day 13), their gut microbiome recovered from dysbiosis that occurred previously due to thiacloprid exposure.

Previous research has demonstrated that honey bees display adverse behavioral and cognitive effects after treatment with sublethal doses of neonicotinoids. In laboratory studies, honey bees simultaneously increase their proportional intake of neonicotinoid-treated solutions and decrease their total solution consumption to some concentrations of certain neonicotinoids. These findings suggest that neonicotinoids might elicit a suboptimal response in honey bees, in which they forage preferentially on foods containing pesticides, effectively increasing their exposure, while also decreasing their total food intake; however, behavioral responses in semifield and field conditions are less understood. Here we conducted a feeder experiment with freely flying bees to determine the effects of a sublethal, field-realistic concentration of imidacloprid (IMD) on the foraging and recruitment behaviors of honey bees visiting either a control feeder containing a sucrose solution or a treatment feeder containing the same sucrose solution with IMD. We report that IMD-treated honey bees foraged less frequently (-28%) and persistently (-66%) than control foragers. Recruitment behaviors (dance frequency and dance propensity) also decreased with IMD, but nonsignificantly.

At the same time the potential influences of simultaneously occurring agricultural agents on insect pollinator health remain largely unknown. Due to different farming methods, and the drift of applied agents and manure, pollinators are most probably exposed to insecticides but also bacteria from organic fertilizers at the same time. We orally exposed honeybee workers to sub-lethal doses of the insecticide thiacloprid and two strains of the bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, which can occur in manure from farming animals. Our results show that under laboratory conditions the bees simultaneously exposed to the a bacterium and the pesticide thiacloprid thiacloprid had significant higher survival rates 11 days post exposure than the controls, which surprisingly showed the lowest survival. Bees that were exposed to diet containing thiacloprid showed decreased food intake. General antibacterial activity is increased by the insecticide and the bacteria, resulting in a higher immune response observed in treated individuals compared to control individuals. We thus propose that caloric restriction through behavioural and physiological adaptations may have mediated an improved survival and stress resistance in our tests. However, the decreased food consumption could in long-term also result in possible negative effects at colony level. Our study does not show an additive negative impact of sub-lethal insecticide and bacteria doses, when tested under laboratory conditions. In contrast, we report seemingly beneficial effects of simultaneous exposure of bees to agricultural agents, which might demonstrate a surprising biological capacity for coping with stressors, possibly through hormetic regulation.",2018/01/31/,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0191256,13,1,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000423668400041,,0,,1,118
410,JOUR,Honeybee gut bacterial strain improved survival and gut microbiota homeostasis in Apis mellifera exposed in vivo to clothianidin,"['El Khoury, S.', 'Gauthier, J.', 'Mercier, P.L.', 'Mo√Øse, S.', 'Giovenazzo, P.', 'Derome, N.']",Microbiology spectrum,"Pesticides are causing honeybee mortality worldwide. Research carried out on honeybees indicates that application of pesticides has a significant impact on the core gut community, which ultimately leads to an increase in the growth of harmful pathogens. Disturbances caused by pesticides also affect the way bacterial members interact, which results in gut microbial dysbiosis. Administration of beneficial microbes has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating or preventing disease in honeybees. The objective of this study was to measure under in vivo conditions the ability of two bacterial strains (the Enterobacter sp. and Pantoea sp.) isolated from honeybee gut to improve survival and mitigate gut microbiota dysbiosis in honeybees exposed to a sublethal clothianidin dose (0.1 ppb). Both gut bacterial strains were selected for their ability to degrade clothianidin in vitro regardless of their host-microbe interaction characteristics (e.g., beneficial, neutral, or harmful). To this end, we conducted cage trials on 4- to 6-day-old newly emerging honeybees. During microbial administration, we jointly monitored the taxonomic distribution and activity level of bacterial symbionts quantifying 16S rRNA transcripts. First, curative administration of the Pantoea sp. strain significantly improved the survival of clothianidin-exposed honeybees compared to sugar control bees (i.e., supplemented with sugar [1:1]).

This study investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to three commercial formulations of agrochemicals [CuSO4 (leaf fertilizer), glyphosate (herbicide), and spinosad (bioinsecticide)] on antioxidant enzymes, malondialdehyde content (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) levels, and total hemocyte count (THC) in the stingless bee Partamona helleri. Foragers were exposed to lethal concentrations aimed to kill 5% (LC5) of CuSO4 (120¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) or spinosad (0.85¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1) over a 24-h period. Glyphosate-exposed bees received the recommended label concentration (7400¬†Œºg¬†mL‚àí1), as they exhibited 100% survival after exposure. Ingestion of CuSO4 or glyphosate-treated diets by bees was reduced. Levels of NO and catalase (CAT) remained unaffected at 0¬†h or 24¬†h post-exposure. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher at 0¬†h compared to 24¬†h, although insignificantly so when compared to the control. Exposure to CuSO4 reduced glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity at 0¬†h but increased it after 24¬†h, for both CuSO4 and glyphosate. MDA levels decreased after 0¬†h exposure to CuSO4 or spinosad but increased after 24¬†h exposure to all tested agrochemicals. THC showed no difference among glyphosate or spinosad compared to the control or across time. However, CuSO4 exposure significantly increased THC. These findings shed light on the physiological responses of stingless bees to agrochemicals, crucial for understanding their overall health. ¬© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s11356-024-34790-w,31,42,54648,54658,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85202610317&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-024-34790-w&partnerID=40&md5=b8e841d5900007b3da045b2bfa1ae36b,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'Sublethal effects', 'survival', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'herbicide', 'Herbicides', 'catalase', 'Glyphosates', 'Weed control', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'Physiological models', 'Physiological response', 'metabolism', 'spinosad', 'biopesticide', 'immunity', 'physiological response', 'Oral exposure', 'blood cell', 'Hemocytes', 'Bioinsecticide', 'Herbicide', 'antioxidant', 'superoxide dismutase', 'Enzymes', 'Oxidative stress', 'Fertilizers', 'Antioxidants', 'Antioxidants enzymes', 'Bioinsecticides', 'Catalase', 'Cellular immunity', 'Cellulars', 'Leaf fertilizer', 'nitric oxide', 'Nitric oxide', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Total hemocyte counts']",,,,0,,1,120

However, little is known about the physiological effects of sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate exposure on bumblebees. We continuously exposed Bombus terrestris to sublethal (2.5¬†mg/L) spinetoram or glyphosate under controlled conditions for 10¬†days. The superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase, prophenoloxidase, Œ±-amylase and protease activities, and changes in gut microbes were measured to understand the effects of sublethal pesticide exposure on the physiology and gut microbes of bumblebees. Sublethal pesticide exposure to significantly increased superoxide dismutase activity and significantly decreased gut Œ±-amylase activity in bumblebees but had no significant effect on glutathione-S-transferase, carboxylesterase or gut protease activities. In addition, glyphosate increased the activity of prophenoloxidase. Interestingly, we observed that neither of the two pesticides had a significant effect on dominant gut bacteria, but glyphosate significantly altered the structure of the dominant gut fungal community, and reduced the relative abundance of Zygosaccharomyces associated with fat accumulation. These results suggest that sublethal spinetoram and glyphosate do not significantly affect the detoxification system of bumblebees, but may affect bumblebee health by inhibiting energy acquisition. Our results provide information on the sublethal effects of exposure to low concentrations of glyphosate and spinetoram on bumblebees in terms of physiology and gut microbes.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute oral exposure to spinosad on the survival, food consumption, flight behavior, respiration rate, activity of detoxification enzymes, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), brain morphology, and hemocyte count of Apis mellifera foragers. We tested six different concentrations of spinosad for the first two analyses, followed by LC50 (7.7 mg L-1) for other assays. Spinosad ingestion decreased survival and food consumption. Exposure to spinosad LC50 reduced flight capacity, respiration rate, and superoxide dismutase activity. Furthermore, this concentration increased glutathione S-transferase activity and the TAC of the brain. Notably, exposure to LC50 damaged mushroom bodies, reduced the total hemocyte count and granulocyte number, and increased the number of prohemocytes.

It is increasingly recognized, that some neonicotinoid insecticides have a negative impact on non-target organisms, including important pollinators such as the European honeybee Apis mellifera. Toxicity of neonicotinoids may be enhanced through simultaneous exposure with additional pesticides, which could help explain, in part, the global decline of honeybee colonies. Here we examined whether exposure effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on bee viability are enhanced by the commonly used fungicide carbendazim and the herbicide glyphosate. We also analysed alternative splicing changes upon pesticide exposure in the honeybee. In particular, we examined transcripts of three genes: (i) the stress sensor gene X box binding protein-1 (Xbp1), (ii) the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) gene and iii) the embryonic lethal/abnormal visual system (elav) gene, which are important for neuronal function. Our results showed that acute thiamethoxam exposure is not enhanced by carbendazim, nor glyphosate.

363,JOUR,Enhancement of chronic bee paralysis virus levels in honeybees acute exposed to imidacloprid: A Chinese case study,"['Diao, Q.', 'Li, B.', 'Zhao, H.', 'Wu, Y.', 'Guo, R.', 'Dai, P.', 'Chen, D.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Hou, C.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Though honeybee populations have not yet been reported to be largely lost in China, many stressors that affect the health of honeybees have been confirmed. Honeybees inevitably come into contact with environmental stressors that are not intended to target honeybees, such as pesticides. Although large-scale losses of honeybee colonies are thought to be associated with viruses, these viruses usually lead to covert infections and to not cause acute damage if the bees do not encounter outside stressors. To reveal the potential relationship between acute pesticides and viruses, we applied different doses of imidacloprid to adult bees that were primarily infected with low levels (4.3 √ó 105 genome copies) of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) to observe whether the acute oral toxicity of imidacloprid was able to elevate the level of CBPV. Here, we found that the titer of CBPV was significantly elevated in adult bees after 96 h of acute treatment with imidacloprid at the highest dose 66.9 ng/bee compared with other treatments and controls. Our study provides clear evidence that exposure to acute high doses of imidacloprid in honeybees persistently infected by CBPV can exert a remarkably negative effect on honeybee survival. These results imply that acute environmental stressors might be one of the major accelerators causing rapid viral replication, which may progress to cause mass proliferation and dissemination and lead to colony decline. The present study will be useful for better understanding the harm caused by this pesticide, especially regarding how honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might be altered by acute pesticide exposure. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.02.258,630,,487,494,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042713901&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.02.258&partnerID=40&md5=6241bf25d47c1976be38365af00d21b6,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,124
129,JOUR,Evidence of diet supplementation with vitamin C protecting honeybees from Imidacloprid induced peroxidative damage: a study with Apis cerana indica,"['Syama, P.S.', 'Sreeranjit Kumar, C.V.']",Sociobiology,"Neonicotinoids are one of the major stresses contributing to the decline in the population of honeybees. Worker bees are prone to various stress factors during foraging and are susceptible to Imidacloprid due to the reduction in the number of genes encoding for the major enzyme families responsible for the detoxification of toxins. The present study worked on the hypothesis that the dietary supplementation of Ascorbic acid (VIT C) could reduce the peroxidative damage in the worker bees of Apis cerana indica exposed to sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (IMD). Furthermore, we also evaluated the role and efficacy of VIT C supplementation on the cytoarchitecture of midgut tissues on exposure to IMD. Colonies of honeybees were maintained by providing sugar syrup to the control group and sugar syrup supplemented with 0.2% VIT C for the experimental group for six months. Worker bees from both groups were randomly collected and exposed to 0.001 mg/mL IMD. To study the peroxidative damage, the activities of various enzymes were analyzed. The activities of antioxidant enzymes including Catalase, Superoxide Dismutase, Glutathione S Transferase, and Glutathione Peroxidase in the hemolymph and midgut tissues of worker bees were significantly decreased due to exposure to IMD as a single agent. However, their activities showed a significant elevation under diet supplementation with VIT C. Histological examination revealed midgut tissue damage and the rupture of peritrophic membrane among the workers exposed to IMD as compared with the control group. The damage to the midgut was alleviated and the peritrophic membrane was found to be intact in the worker bees supplemented with VIT C. Our results indicated that the dietary supplementation of VIT C has the potential to maintain the redox status and thereby can offer protective potential against the peroxidative damages induced by the sub-lethal concentration of IMD. ¬© 2022 Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana.

Pesticides can be present in pollen, nectar, and persist in stored food (honey and bee bread), and viruses can be highly prevalent in honey bee colonies.

No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology. ¬© 2019 Coulon et al.

The drivers for these losses are not fully understood. The influence of pests and pathogens are beyond dispute, but in addition, chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of pesticides has been suggested to affect the performance of honey bee colonies. This study aims to elucidate the potential effects of a chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations (one realistic worst-case concentration) of the neonicotinoid thiacloprid to honey bee colonies in a three year replicated colony feeding study. RESULTS: Thiacloprid did not significantly affect the colony strength. No differences between treatment and control were observed for the mortality of bees, the infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the infection levels of viruses. No colony losses occurred during the overwintering seasons. Furthermore, thiacloprid did not influence the constitutive expression of the immunity-related hymenoptaecin gene. However, upregulation of hymenoptaecin expression as a response to bacterial challenge was less pronounced in exposed bees than in control bees. CONCLUSION: Under field conditions, bee colonies are not adversely affected by a long-lasting exposure to sublethal concentrations of thiacloprid. No indications were found that field-realistic and higher doses exerted a biologically significant effect on colony performance. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

However, there is often intensive use of systemic pesticides in crops, which can be carried to the colony by forage bees through the collection of contaminated pollen and nectar. Inside the colony, pollen loads are stored by bees that add honey and several enzymes to this pollen. Nevertheless, intra-colonial chronic exposure could induce sublethal effects in young bees exposed to a wide range of pesticides present in these pollen loads. This study was aimed to both determine the survival rate and evaluate the sublethal effects on the hepato-nephrocitic system in response to continuous oral exposure to lower concentrations of neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TXT) and picoxystrobin fungicide (PXT). Exposure to a single chemical and co-exposure to both pesticides were performed in newly emerged honeybee workers. A significant decrease in the bee survival rates was observed following exposure to TXT (0.001 ng a.i./mu L) and PXT (0.018 ng a.i./mu L), as well as following co-exposure to TXT+PXT/2. After five days of continuous exposure, TXT induced sub-lethal effects in the organs involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics, such as the fat body and pericardial cells, and it also induced a significant increase in the hemocyte number. Thus, the hepato-nephrocitic system (HNS) reached the greatest level of activity of pericardial cells as an attempt to eliminate this toxic compound from hemolymph. The HNS was activated at low levels by PXT without an increase in the hemocyte number; however, the mobilization of neutral glycoconjugates from the trophocytes of the fat body was prominent only in this group. TXT and PXT co-exposure induced intermediary morphological effects in trophocytes and pericardial cells, but oenocytes from the fat body presented with atypical cytoplasm granulation only in this group. These data showed that the realistic concentrations of these pesticides are harmful to newly emerged Africanized honeybees, indicating that intra-colonial chronic exposure drastically reduces the longevity of bees exposed to neonicotinoid insecticide (TXT) and the fungicide strobilurin (PXT) as in single and co-exposure. Additionally, the sublethal effects observed in the organs constituting the HNS suggest that the activation of this system, even during exposure to low concentrations of theses pesticides, is an attempt to maintain homeostasis of the bees. These data together are alarming because these pesticides can affect the performance of the entire colony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental groups were essayed: control (CTR), solvent control (ACT), imidacloprid (IMI, 0.0028 ng/ŒºL), pyraclostrobin (PYR, 2.7 ng/ŒºL) and imidacloprid + pyraclostrobin (I + P). The data demonstrated that the residual doses applied in T. diversipes adults are sublethal at 96 h. Both oenocytes and trophocytes cells responded to topical exposure to the pesticides, showing morphological changes. In the IMI group, the bee oenocytes showed the greatest proportion of vacuolization and altered nuclei. The pyraclostrobin exposure increased the intensity of PAS-positive labeling (glycogen) in trophocytes. This increase was also observed in the I + P group. Changes in energy reserve (glycogen) of trophocytes indicate a possible mobilization impairment of this neutral polysaccharide to the hemolymph, which can compromise the fitness of exposed individuals. Also, changes in oenocytes can compromise the detoxification function performed by the fat body.

In this study, we used examinations of brain gene expression to explore the sublethal consequences of neonicotinoid pesticide exposure and pollen diet composition in nest-founding bumble bee queens. We demonstrate for the first time that pollen diet composition can influence the strength of bumble bee queen responses to pesticide exposure at the molecular level. Specifically, one pollen mixture in our study appeared to buffer bumble bee queens entirely against the effects of pesticide exposure, with respect to brain gene expression. Additionally, we detected unique effects of pollen diet and sustained (versus more temporary) pesticide exposure on queen gene expression.

They are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists which disrupt the function of insect neurons and cause paralysis and death. In addition to direct mortality, there are numerous sublethal effects of low doses of neonicotinoids on bees. We hypothesize that some of these large array of effects could be a consequence of epigenetic changes in bees induced by neonicotinoids. We compared whole methylome (BS-seal) and RNA-seal libraries of the brains of buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris workers exposed to field-realistic doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid to libraries from control workers. We found numerous genes which show differential expression between neonicotinoid-treated bees and control bees, but no differentially methylated cytosines in any context.

Pesticides enter the hive through contaminated nectar and pollen carried by returning forager honey bees or placed in the hive by beekeepers when managing hive pests. We used an in vitro rearing method to characterize the effects of seven pesticides on developing brood subjected dietary exposure at worse-case environmental concentrations detected in wax and pollen. The pesticides tested included acaricides (amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate), insecticides (chlorpyrifos, imidacloprid), one fungicide (chlorothalonil), and one herbicide (glyphosate). The larvae were exposed chronically for six days of mimicking exposure during the entire larval feeding period, which is the worst possible scenario of larval exposure. Survival, duration of immature development, the weight of newly emerged adult, morphologies of the antenna and the hypopharyngeal gland, and gene expression were recorded. Survival of bees exposed to amitraz, coumaphos, fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil was the most sensitive endpoint despite observed changes in many developmental and physiological parameters across the seven pesticides. Our findings suggest that pesticide exposure during larvae development may affect the survival and health of immature honey bees, thus contributing to overall colony stress or loss. Additionally, pesticide exposure altered gene expression of detoxification enzymes. However, the tested exposure scenario is unlikely to be representative of real-world conditions but emphasizes the importance of proper hive management to minimize pesticide contamination of the hive environment or simulates a future scenario of increased contamination. ¬© 2019; The chronic larval exposure to different pesticides affect the survival and health of immature and potentially newly emerged adult honey bees. ¬© 2019",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113420,256,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076237910&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2019.113420&partnerID=40&md5=be410da64ffc9a42e16734b02679e011,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,133

With regard to the widespread use of pesticides in agricultural lands, honey bees, as non-target and useful insect, inadvertently contact these chemicals. Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of some pesticides, the toxicity of three insecticides from different chemical classes including imidacloprid (0.16¬†mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47¬†mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500¬†mg a.i./l) on detoxifying enzymes of worker honey bees and mortality of immature bees was investigated. These chemicals were selected because they are used globally and ingested by honey bees. The sub-lethal concentration of imidacloprid reduced the activity of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST). Exposure to the sub-lethal concentrations of the ethion reduced the esterase (EST) activities in treated honey bees. Exposure of honey bee larvae to imidacloprid (0.16¬†mg a.i./l), ethion (79.47¬†mg a.i./l), and hexaflumuron (500¬†mg a.i./l) increased the mortality of the treated group compared to untreated controls, but this difference was not statistically significant.

It is urgently necessary to assess the effects of mixtures on pollinator risk assessments because they are often exposed to numerous agrochemicals. In the present study, we explored the mixture toxic effects of thiacloprid (THI) and cyproconazole (CYP) on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Our findings revealed that THI possessed higher acute toxicity to A. mellifera (96-h LC50 value of 216.3 mg a.i. L‚àí1) than CYP (96-h LC50 value of 601.4 mg a.i. L‚àí1). It's worth noting that the mixture of THI and CYP exerted an acute synergistic effect on honey bees. At the same time, the activities of detoxification enzyme cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) and neuro target enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as the expressions of seven genes (CRBXase, CYP306A1, CYP6AS14, apidaecin, defensing-2, vtg, and gp-93) associated with detoxification metabolism, immune response, development, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, were significantly altered in the combined treatment compared with the corresponding individual exposures of THI or CYP. These data indicated that a mixture of THI and CYP could disturb the physiological homeostasis of honey bees. Our study provides a theoretical basis for in-depth studies on the impacts of pesticide mixtures on the health of honey bees.

Sublethal effects, such as behavior alterations, are neglected in pesticide regulation for pollinators. However, these effects can bring important information to understanding the impacts of pesticides on bees' daily activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) on the behavior of the Neotropical solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male bees were exposed to these chemicals continuously for 48 h, followed by an additional 48 h without contaminated food, totaling 96 h of observation. We used five experimental groups: control, solvent control, insecticide, fungicide, and pesticide mixture (insecticide + fungicide). Behavioral alterations based on locomotion and light response were assessed by video tracking at 48 (end of pesticide exposure) and 96 h (end of bioassay). In addition, after recording bees at 96 h, the individuals were anesthetized for brain collection and histological evaluation of mushroom bodies to evaluate if pesticides can damage their neurons and impair the cognitive processes and responses of bees to sensory stimuli. Bees exposed to acetamiprid and pesticide mixture showed lethargic movements and impaired locomotion at 48 h. Notably, these behavioral effects were no longer evident after the bees consumed uncontaminated food for an additional 48 h, totaling 96 h from the start of pesticide exposure. Only fungicide exposure did not result in any behavioral or brain histological changes. Therefore, our study showed that acetamiprid at an estimated residual concentration, despite being classified as having low toxicity for bees, can cause significant initial locomotion disruption in solitary bees.

The aim of this study was thus to investigate the impact of imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, on the cellular immune response of two pollinators (Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris) during simultaneous immune activation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) of Escherichia coli. For this purpose the phagocytosis capacity as well as the production of H2O2 and NO of larval hemocytes, exposed to five different imidacloprid concentrations in vitro, was measured. All used pesticide concentrations showed a weakening effect on phagocytosis with but also without LPS activation. Imidacloprid decreased H2O2 and increased NO production in honeybees. Immune activation by LPS clearly reinforced the effect of imidacloprid on the immune response of hemocytes in all three immune parameters tested.

However, the use of synthetic insecticides has been increased on a global scale in the recent decades. In order to evaluate an alternative to the use of neonicotinoids, this work investigated the effects of a bioinsecticide and its major compound on A. mellifera (Apidae: Hymenoptera), one of the main pollinators of crop plants. For this, bees were exposed, by contact and ingestion, to the essential oil of Cymbopogon martinii (Poaceae: Poales), to geraniol (major compound) and the insecticide imidacloprid to evaluate the toxicity and behavioral effects as well as the locomotion changes and immune responses of bees treated with these compounds. In general, toxicity was greater through ingestion and the insecticide imidacloprid was more toxic to A. mellifera compared to the essential oil and its major compound. The individual and collective behaviors (i.e. trophallaxis, grooming, avoidance) as well as the immune responses of bees were not significantly affected by bioinsecticides. However, the locomotion response and flight orientation of the bees were significantly altered by insecticide when administered by ingestion.

In this scenario, this study evaluated the survival and histopathological effects caused by the neonicotinoid insecticide acetamiprid (7 ng/ŒºL) and the fungicide azoxystrobin (10 ng/ŒºL) in the midgut and parietal fat body of the solitary bee Centris analis. Female and male newly-emerged bees were orally exposed for 48 h to the pesticides, or alone or in combination, under laboratory conditions. The exposure to the insecticide reduced the survival of males, while the mixture reduced survival in both sexes. Acetamiprid promoted a reduction in the number of regenerative nests in the midgut, alterations of fat body cells by increasing carbohydrates in trophocytes, and reduction of oenocyte size, and increased the frequency of pericardial cells in the advanced activity stage. Both pesticides caused changes in HSP70 immunolabelling of midgut from males at the end of pesticide exposure. Comparatively, the effects on males were stronger than in females exposed to the same pesticides. Therefore, acetamiprid alone and in mixture with fungicide azoxystrobin can be harmful to males and females of Neotropical solitary bee C. analis showing lethal and sublethal effects at a concentration likely to be found in the environment. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124712,360,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201012084&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124712&partnerID=40&md5=473fb0290f046c3ad77add42df7197ea,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'Pesticide', 'survival', 'adult', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'midgut', 'Survival', 'antibody labeling', 'Fat body', 'fungicide', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'strobilurin', 'Strobilurins', 'Brazil', 'Female', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'histopathology', 'Pyrimidines', 'fat pad', 'chemical pollutant', 'Azoxystrobin', 'RNA interference', '% reductions', 'sex difference', 'azoxystrobin', 'pyrimidine derivative', 'fertility', 'aubergine', 'cell adhesion', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP', 'gender', 'Hsp70', 'Limited information', 'Malpighiales', 'Methacrylates', 'methacrylic acid']",,,,0,,1,141

Changes in the immune response may hinder insects more susceptible to diseases and increase the risk of pathogen infection and pest resistance. We found that imidacloprid and amitraz alter the oxidative response of insect hemocytes at different concentrations of the immune stimulator, zymosan A. There is a differential effect of imidacloprid and amitraz on hemocytes of insects from different orders and their effect on oxidative response in insects persists beyond the point of early contact with zymosan A. Invertebrates have a diverse immune system that responds differently to stressors such as pesticides and pathogens, which leads to different degrees of susceptibility. Honeybees are facing a phenomenon called colony collapse disorder which is attributed to several factors including pesticides and pathogens. We applied an in vitro approach to assess the response of immune-activated hemocytes from Apis mellifera, Drosophila melanogaster and Mamestra brassicae after exposure to imidacloprid and amitraz. Hemocytes were exposed to the pesticides in single and co-exposures using zymosan A for immune activation. We measured the effect of these exposures on cell viability, nitric oxide (NO) production from 15 to 120 min and on extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production after 3 h to assess potential alterations in the oxidative response. Our results indicate that NO and H2O2 production is more altered in honeybee hemocytes compared to D. melanogaster and M. brassicae cell lines. There is also a differential production at different time points after pesticide exposure between these insect species as contrasting effects were evident with the oxidative responses in hemocytes.

Hence honey bees are often exposed to these pesticides. But until now, the effects of theses combinations at field-realistic doses on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE. These results show that chronic combined exposure to pesticides of relatively low toxicity may caused severely physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the honey bees. ¬© 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019///,2019,10.1007/s10646-019-02030-4,28,4,399,411,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062991130&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-019-02030-4&partnerID=40&md5=94209aafe303ea739b1dc023f0ea4d6e,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,143

ML has significant potential in risk assessments of non-target insects for modeling the multiple factors affecting insect health, including the adverse effects of agrochemicals. Here, the potential of ML for risk assessments of glyphosate (herbicide; formulation) and imidacloprid (insecticide, neonicotinoid; formulation) on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata was explored. The collective behavior of forager bees was analyzed after in vitro exposure to agrochemicals. ML algorithms were applied to identify the agrochemicals that the bees have been exposed to based on multivariate behavioral features. Changes in the in situ detection of different proteins in the midgut were also studied. Imidacloprid exposure leads to the greatest changes in behavior. The ML algorithms achieved a higher accuracy (up to 91%) in identifying agrochemical contamination. The two agrochemicals altered the detection of cells positive for different proteins, which can be detrimental to midgut physiology. This study provides a holistic assessment of the sublethal effects of glyphosate and imidacloprid on a key pollinator.

The present study was aimed towards establishing the mean lethal concentration (LC50) of three pesticides viz. carbamate (carbaryl), organophosphate (chlorpyrifos) and neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) in honeybees through feeding bioassay laboratory trial. Deleteriousness was confirmed through mortality rate, number of survival bees, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), total protein (TP) levels, AChE gene transcription level, and gut tissues histological analysis of exposed honeybees. Mean mortality rate was calculated for 96 h interval at three different concentrations of tested pesticides (5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg L-1), and LC50 values calculated for 48 and 96 h interval. AChE enzyme and TP level are determined by ELIZA and spectrophotometer, respectively. Results revealed that imidacloprid had the lowest LC50 (0.477 ng/bee) values as compared with carbaryl and chlorpyrifos. High mortality rate was observed at highest dose, being impidacloprid have more lethal effects as compared with other pesticides. Similarly, biochemical analysis revealed that imidiacloprid and chlorpyrifos significantly (P <= 0.05) increased AChE and TP levels, whereas carbaryl significantly (P <= 0.05) decreased them. Similarly, probe based RT qPCR revealed that imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatments significantly (P <= 0.05) enhanced the AChE level whereas carbaryl decreased it.

142,JOUR,One size does not fit all: Caste and sex differences in the response of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to chronic oral neonicotinoid exposure,"['Mobley, MW', 'Gegear, RJ']",PLOS ONE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been implicated in the rapid global decline of bumblebees over recent years, particularly in agricultural and urban areas. While there is much known about neonicotinoid toxicity effects at the colony stage of the bumblebee annual cycle, far less is known about such effects at other stages critical for the maintenance of wild populations. In the present work, individual-based feeding assays were used to show that chronic consumption of the widely used neonicotinoid clothianidin at a field-realistic average rate of 3.6 and 4.0 ng/g.bee/day reduces survival of queen and male bumblebees, respectively, within a 7-day period. In contrast, worker survival was unaffected at a similar consumption rate of 3.9 ng/g.bee/day. To test the hypothesis that males have a lower tolerance for oral clothianidin exposure than workers due to their haploid genetic status, RNAseq analysis was used to compare the transcriptomic responses of workers and males to chronic intake of clothianidin at a sub-lethal dose of 0.37ng/bee/day for 5 days. Surprisingly, clothianidin consumption only altered the expression of 19 putative detoxification genes in a sex-specific manner, with 11/19 genes showing increased expression in workers. Sub-lethal clothianidin exposure also altered the expression of 40 genes associated with other major biological functions, including locomotion, reproduction, and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that chronic oral toxicity effects of neonicotinoids are greatest during mating and nest establishment phases of the bumblebee life cycle. Chronic oral toxicity testing on males and queens is therefore required in order to fully assess the impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumblebee populations.",2018/10/08/,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0200041,13,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000446632700003,,0,,1,146
268,JOUR,Responses of honey bees to lethal and sublethal doses of formulated clothianidin alone and mixtures,"['Yao, J.', 'Zhu, Y.C.', 'Adamczyk, J.']",Journal of Economic Entomology,"The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides has sparked concern over the toxicity risk to honey bees (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)). In this study, feeding treatments with the clothianidin formulation at 2.6 ppb (residue concentration) or its binary mixtures with five representative pesticides (classes) did not influence on adult survivorship, but all treatments caused significantly lower body weight than controls. Most binary mixtures at residue levels showed minor or no interaction on body weight loss, and synergistic interaction was detected only from the mixture of clothianidin + Œª -cyhalothrin. Chlorpyrifos alone and the mixture of clothianidin + chlorpyrifos significantly suppressed esterase (EST) activity, while most treatments of individual pesticides and mixtures had no effect on EST and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities. However, ingestion of clothianidin at 2.6 ppb significantly enhanced P450 oxidase activity by 19%. The LC 50 of formulated clothianidin was estimated at 0.53 ppm active ingredient, which is equivalent to 25.4 ng clothianidin per bee (LD 50) based on the average sugar consumption of 24 Œºl per bee per day. In addition to mortality, ingestion of clothianidin at LC 50 significantly reduced bee body weight by 12%. P450 activities were also significantly induced at 24 and 48 h in clothianidin-treated bees, while no significant difference was found in GST and EST activities. Further examinations revealed that the expression of an important CYP9q1 detoxification gene was significantly induced by clothianidin. Thus, data consistently indicated that P450s were involved in clothianidin detoxification in honey bees. Although the honey bee population in Stoneville (MS, United States) had sixfold lower susceptibility than other reported populations, clothianidin had very high oral toxicity to bees. ¬© Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2018.",2018///,2018,10.1093/jee/toy140,111,4,1517,1525,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053733948&doi=10.1093%2fjee%2ftoy140&partnerID=40&md5=35bbee65087b34aab15e9e1271c6097a,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,147

Multiple studies of CarEs have focused on pesticide metabolism in insects, while few studies have aimed to identify CarE functions in oxidative resistance, particularly in Apis cerana cerana. In this study, we isolated a carboxylesterase gene, esterase FE4, from Apis cerana cerana and designated it towards an exploration of its roles as an antioxidant and in detoxification. We investigated AcceFE4 expression patterns in response to various stressors. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that AcceFE4 was up-regulated by H2O2, imidacloprid, and paraquat, and was down-regulated by 4 degrees C, UV radiation, CdCl2, and HgCl2. Additionally, the protein expression of this gene was down-regulated at 4 degrees C and up-regulated by H2O2. Disc diffusion assays showed that the AcceFE4 recombinant protein-expressing bacteria had a smaller killing zone than the control group with the paraquat, HgCl2 and cumyl hydroperoxide treatments. Moreover, when the gene was knocked down by RNA interference, we observed that multiple oxidant genes (i.e., AccSOD, AccGST, AccTrx, AccMsrA, and others) were down-regulated in the knockdown samples. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) activity levels were reduced in the knockdown samples relative to the control group. Finally, we measured the enzyme activity of carboxylesterase and found that the enzyme activity was also reduced in the silent samples. Together, these data suggest that AcceFE4 may be involved in the oxidative resistance response during adverse stress.

Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells, indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior. Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level, only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental effects of clothianidin were observed. Given these findings, neonicotinoid risk needs to be considered independently for each compound and target species. ¬© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep24764,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964886747&doi=10.1038%2fsrep24764&partnerID=40&md5=8f1f4a2a435a30867ab553fde21e0693,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,149

Honeybees are exposed to two widely used classes of cholinergic pesticide: neonicotinoids (nicotinic receptor agonists) and organophosphate miticides (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Although sublethal levels of neonicotinoids are known to disrupt honeybee learning and behaviour, the neurophysiological basis of these effects has not been shown. Here, using recordings from mushroom body Kenyon cells in acutely isolated honeybee brain, we show that the neonicotinoids imidacloprid and clothianidin, and the organophosphate miticide coumaphos oxon, cause a depolarization-block of neuronal firing and inhibit nicotinic responses. These effects are observed at concentrations that are encountered by foraging honeybees and within the hive, and are additive with combined application.

Toxicity levels were verified by bioassays. In bioassay 1, the levels correspond to the percentages of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01% of the recommended concentration for field application of the commercial product Nortox¬Æ (active ingredient imidacloprid), with which we obtained the mean lethal concentration (LC50) in 48 h for A. mellifera, determining the concentration ranges to be used in the subsequent bioassays. Bioassays 2 and 3 followed the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which specify the LC50 (48 h). In bioassay 4, the LC50 (48 h) and the survival rate of bees for a period of 120 h were determined by contact with a surface contaminated with imidacloprid, and in bioassay 5, the interference of the insecticide with the flight behavior of bees was evaluated.

In the current study, we evaluated the acute and chronic toxicity of dinotefuran enantiomers to honeybee larvae in vitro and explored the mechanism of toxicity. The results showed that the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of S-dinotefuran to honeybee larvae was 30.0 Œºg/larva after oral exposure for 72 h, which was more toxic than rac-dinotefuran (92.7 Œºg/larva) and R-dinotefuran (183.6 Œºg/larva). Although the acute toxicity of the three forms of dinotefuran to larvae was lower than that to adults, chronic exposure significantly reduced larval survival, larval weight, and weight of newly emerged adults. Analysis of gene expression and hormone titer indicated that dinotefuran affects larval growth and development by interfering with nutrient digestion and absorption and the molting system. Analysis of hemolymph metabolome further revealed that disturbances in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and energy metabolism are the key mechanisms of dinotefuran toxicity to bee larvae. In addition, melatonin and vitellogenin are used by larvae to cope with dinotefuran-induced oxidative stress.

Frequent exposure to toxic pesticides is one of the major risk factors causing the pollinator population decline. However, age effects of honey bees on pesticide susceptibility have been largely ignored and many researchers use bees of unknown age for assessing the risk of pesticides. Honey bee workers are known to go through physiological and behavioral changes in order to differentiate different phenotypes to perform specific duties over their natural lifetime of 6 weeks or longer. In this study, we provide multi-parameter evidences of unignorable age effects of honey bee workers and suggest using a standard bee age to produce reliable and comparable data when assessing variable and realistic situations of in-hive and field exposures to pesticides. Using honey bee workers aged 4- to 42-days old, we examined susceptibility of the bees to five different insecticides from five different classes and measured enzymatic activities of three major detoxification enzymes and an invertase involved in honey production. Results showed gradual increase of natural mortality and decrease of soluble protein content in bees over the age span from 4 days to 42 days. Significant increases of mortality after separate treatments of five different insecticides confirmed drastic age effects of bees over the assessed age span. As they aged, honey bees also showed a gradual increase of cytochrome P450 oxidase activity while still maintaining constant levels of two other detoxification enzymes (esterase and glutathione S-transferase) and an invertase responsible for honey production. ¬© 2020",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.cbpc.2020.108844,238,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089262289&doi=10.1016%2fj.cbpc.2020.108844&partnerID=40&md5=01cf9a35d7021a7a9303c0b2f05f247f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'cyhalothrin', 'nonhuman', 'pyrethroid', 'Apis mellifera', 'mortality', 'priority journal', 'metabolism', 'cytochrome P450', 'insecticide resistance', 'enzyme activity', 'organophosphate insecticide', 'carbamic acid derivative', 'age', 'oxamyl', 'esterase', 'Esterases', 'glutathione transferase', 'Insecticide Resistance', 'drug sensitivity', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'aging', 'Aging', 'enzymology', 'acephate', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Invertase', 'cytochrome P450 reductase', 'Detoxification enzymes', 'Age', 'Age Factors', 'beta fructofuranosidase', 'beta-Fructofuranosidase', 'Soluble protein', 'Worker']",,,,0,,1,155

Declines in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for synergistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure (-50%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors reduced also food consumption (-48%) and haemolymph levels of glucose (-60%) and trehalose (-27%). Our results provide the first demonstration that field-realistic nutritional stress and pesticide exposure can synergistically interact and cause significant harm to animal survival.

A significant reduction in the concentration of the thiol group of proteins was observed in the two imidacloprid-fed groups, and the addition of caffeine protected these groups. Imidacloprid increased the malondialdehyde concentration while the addition of caffeine partially decreased this effect. Food intake was higher for bees treated with 2.0¬†ng/mL imidacloprid.

CpTI (Cowpea Trypsin Inhibitor) cotton cultivar CCRI41 is increasingly used in China and potential side effects on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. have been documented recently. Two studies have assessed potential lethal and sublethal effects in young bees fed with CCRI41 cotton pollen but no effect was observed on learning capacities, although lower feeding activity in exposed honey bees was noted (antifeedant effect). The present study aimed at providing further insights into potential side effects of CCRI41 cotton on honey bees. Emerging honey bees were exposed to different pollen diets using no-choice feeding protocols (chronic exposure) in controlled laboratory conditions and we aimed at documenting potential mechanisms underneath the CCRI41 antifeedant effect previously reported. Activity of midgut proteolytic enzyme of young adult honey bees fed on CCRI41 cotton pollen were not significantly affected, i.e. previously observed antifeedant effect was not linked to disturbed activity of the proteolytic enzymes in bees' midgut. Hypopharyngeal gland development was assessed by quantifying total extractable proteins from the glands. Results suggested that CCRI41 cotton pollen carries no risk to hypopharyngeal gland development of young adult honey bees. In the two bioassays, honey bees exposed to 1 % soybean trypsin inhibitor were used as positive controls for both midgut proteolytic enzymes and hypopharyngeal gland proteins quantification, and bees exposed to 48 ppb (part per billion) (i.e. 48 ng g -1) imidacloprid were used as controls for exposure to a sublethal concentration of toxic product. The results show that the previously reported antifeedant effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees is not linked to effects on their midgut proteolytic enzymes or on the development of their hypopharyngeal glands.

The cellular oxidative stress response is usually regulated by heat shock proteins (Hsps) acting as molecular chaperones. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), one of the most widely studied co-chaperones, functions as an adaptor that directs Hsp90 to Hsp70-client protein complexes. However, the biological functions of STIP1 remain poorly understood in honeybee (Apis cerana cerana). In this study, AccSTIP1 was identified in Apis cerana cerana. AccSTIP1 transcription was found to be induced by heat (42 degrees C), HgCl2, H2O2 and different pesticides (emamectin benzoate, thiamethoxam, hexythiazox and paraquat) and inhibited by CdCl2, UV and kresoxim-methyl. Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that the expression profiles of AccSTIP1 were consistent with its transcriptional expression levels. The disc diffusion assay showed that chemically competent transetta (DE3) bacteria expressing a recombinant AccSTIP1 protein displayed the smaller death zones than did control bacteria after exposure to paraquat and HgCl2. The DNA nicking assay suggested that recombinant purified AccSTIP1 protected supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA from damage caused by a thiol-dependent mixed-function oxidation (MFO) system. After knocking down AccSTIP1 gene expression via RNA interference (RNAi), the transcript levels of antioxidation-related genes were obviously lower in dsAccSTIP1 honeybees compared with those in the uninjected honeybees.

However, the molecular bases mediated at the gene level remain to be discovered. Here, we found four heat shock protein DnaJB subfamily genes, DnaJB6, DnaJshv, DnaJB13, and DnaJB14, from Apis cerana cerana, that all have J domains in their protein sequences. The expression levels of DnaJB6 and DnaJshv were upregulated by different degrees of heat stress, and the transcript level of DnaJB14 was gradually upregulated as the degree of heat stress increased, while the mRNA level of DnaJB13 was downregulated at multiple time points during heat stress treatment. The mRNA levels of all four DnaJBs were upregulated by cold and UV stress. In addition, the expression levels of DnaJB6, DnaJshv and DnaJB13 were reduced under abamectin, imidacloprid, cypermethrin, bifenthrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl stresses. The transcript level of DnaJB14 was decreased by imidacloprid, cypermethrin, spirodiclofen, and methomyl exposure but increased by abamectin and bifenthrin exposure. These results indicate that the demand of A. cerana cerana for these four DnaJBs differs under various stress conditions. To further explore the role of DnaJBs in the stress response, we successfully silenced DnaJshv and DnaJB14. The content of protein carbonyl was increased, while the content of VC, the enzymatic activities of CAT, GST, and SOD, the mRNA levels of many antioxidant-related genes, and the total antioxidant capacity were reduced after knockdown of DnaJshv and DnaJB14 in A. cerana cerana.

A strong immune defence is vital for the fitness of bees. However, the immune system can be weakened by environmental factors that may render bees more vulnerable to parasites and pathogens. Here we demonstrate for the first time that field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid insecticide thiacloprid can severely affect the immunocompetence of Osmia bicornis. In detail, males exposed to thiacloprid solutions of 200 and 555 ¬µg/kg showed a reduction in hemocyte density. Moreover, functional aspects of the immune defence - the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph - were impaired in males. In females, however, only a concentration of 555 ¬µg/kg elicited similar immunosuppressive effects. Although males are smaller than females, they consumed more food solution. This leads to a 2.77 times higher exposure in males, probably explaining the different concentration thresholds observed between the sexes. In contrast to honeybees, dietary exposure to thiacloprid did not affect melanisation or wound healing in O. bicornis. Our results demonstrate that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the immunocompetence of O. bicornis, possibly leading to an impaired disease resistance capacity. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-61445-w,10,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081579236&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-61445-w&partnerID=40&md5=27c64e7d725c3d59e59115314a2723b7,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'female', 'drug effect', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'male', 'thiacloprid', 'Male', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Female', 'hemolymph', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'immunology', 'blood cell', 'cell count', 'Cell Count', 'Hemocytes', 'Hemolymph', 'immunosuppressive agent', 'Immunosuppressive Agents']",,,,0,,1,167

Previous studies have indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides cause behavioural abnormalities and have proven that exposure to sublethal doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage decreases the olfactory learning ability of adults. The present study shows the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on the neural development of the honey bee brain by immunolabelling synaptic units in the calyces of mushroom bodies. We found that the density of the synaptic units in the region of the calyces, which are responsible for olfactory and visual functions, decreased after being exposed to a sublethal dose of imidacloprid. This not only links a decrease in olfactory learning ability to abnormal neural connectivity but also provides evidence that imidacloprid damages the development of the nervous system in regions responsible for both olfaction and vision during the larval stage of the honey bee.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep19298,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955297378&doi=10.1038%2fsrep19298&partnerID=40&md5=2f1eeec397546a1e15abccf85d931d6b,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,169

Although both stressors individually have been shown to affect bumblebee health negatively, few studies have focused on stressor interactions, a scenario expected in intensively used agricultural landscapes. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, a key pollinator in agricultural landscapes, we conducted a fully factorial laboratory experiment starting at nest initiation. We assessed the effects of food quality and insecticides, alone and in interaction, on health traits at various levels, some of which have been rarely studied. Pollen with a diluted nutrient content (low quality) reduced ovary size and delayed colony development. Wing asymmetry, indicating developmental stress, was increased during insecticide exposure and interactions with poor food, whereas both stressors reduced body size. Both stressors and their interaction changed the workers' chemical profile and reduced worker interactions and the immune response. Our findings suggest that insecticides combined with nutritional stress reduce bumblebee health at the individual and colony levels, thus possibly affecting colony performance, such as development and reproduction, and the stability of plant-pollinator networks.

Colony-level neonicotinoid exposure has negative effects on reproductive fitness of honey bee queens. However, it is unclear if the observed effects are a direct outcome of neonicotinoid toxicity or result from suboptimal care of developing queens by exposed workers. The aim of this study was to evaluate larval survival, reproductive fitness, and histopathology of honey bee queens exposed to incremental doses (0, 5, 50 ng) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (THI) applied directly to individual late larvae (7 days post-oviposition) of queens. The 5 ng dose represents a calculated high environmental level of exposure for honey bee queen larvae. Morphometric evaluation revealed that the total area of mandibular gland epithelium in queens exposed to 5 and 50 ng THI was reduced by 14% (P =.12) and 25% (P =.001), respectively. Decreased mandibular gland size may alter pheromone production, which could in part explain previously observed negative effects of THI on the reproductive fitness of queens. We also found that late larval exposure to THI reduced larval and pupal survival and decreased sperm viability in mated queens.

Even at low concentrations, the effects of these mixtures on bee populations are difficult to predict due to potential synergistic interactions. In this paper, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis to environmentally realistic levels of clothianidin (neonicotinoid insecticide) and propiconazole (fungicide), singly and in combination. The amount of feeding solution consumed was highest in bees exposed to the neonicotinoid, and lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Ovary maturation and longevity of bees of the neonicotinoid and the fungicide treatments did not differ from those of control bees. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed slow ovary maturation and decreased longevity. We found a synergistic interaction between the neonicotinoid and the fungicide on survival probability. We also found an interaction between treatment and emergence time (an indicator of physiological condition) on longevity. Longevity was negatively correlated to physiological condition only in the fungicide and the mixture treatments. Delayed ovary maturation and premature death imply a shortened nesting period (highly correlated to fecundity in Osmia).

The introduced parasite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid class of insecticides each represent important, nearly ubiquitous biotic and abiotic stressors to honey bees, respectively. Previous research demonstrated that they can synergistically interact to negatively affect non-reproductive honey bee female workers, but no data exist on how concurrent exposure may affect reproductive honey bee males (drones). This is important, given that the health of reproductive females (queens), possibly because of poor mating, is frequently cited as a major driver of honey bee colony loss. To address this, known age cohorts of drones were obtained from 12 honey bee colonies‚Äîseven were exposed to field-relevant concentrations of two neonicotinoids (4.5 ppb thiamethoxam and 1.5 ppb clothianidin) during development via supplementary pollen patties; five colonies received patties not spiked with neonicotinoids. Artificially emerged drones were assessed for natural V. destructor infestation, weighed, and then allocated to the following treatment groups: 1. Control, 2. V. destructor only, 3. Neonicotinoid only, and 4. Combined (both mites and neonicotinoid). Adult drones were maintained in laboratory cages alongside attendant workers (1 drone: 2 worker ratio) until they have reached sexual maturity after 14 days so sperm concentration and viability could be assessed. The data suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids interacted synergistically to negatively affect adult drone survival, but that they interacted antagonistically on emergence mass. Although sample sizes were too low to assess the effects of V. destructor and combined exposure on sperm quality, we observed no influence of neonicotinoids on sperm concentration or viability. Our findings highlight the diverse effects of concurrent exposure to stressors on honey bees, and suggest that V. destructor and neonicotinoids can severely affect the number of sexually mature adult drones available for mating.

The hypopharyngeal food glands of workers play a crucial role in this context. Even though there is consensus that ubiquitous ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor and widespread insecticides, such as neonicotinoids, are major stressors for honey bee health, their impact alone and in combination on the feeding glands of workers is poorly understood. Here, we show that combined exposure to V. destructor and neonicotinoids antagonistically interacted on hypopharyngeal gland size, yet they did not interact on emergence body mass or survival. While the observed effects of the antagonistic interaction were less negative than expected based on the sum of the individual effects, hypopharyngeal gland size was still significantly reduced. Alone, V. destructor parasitism negatively affected emergence body mass, survival, and hypopharyngeal gland size, whereas neonicotinoid exposure reduced hypopharyngeal gland size only. Since size is associated with hypopharyngeal gland functionality, a reduction could result in inadequate brood care. As cooperative brood care is a cornerstone of eusociality, smaller glands could have adverse down-stream effects on inclusive fitness of honey bee colonies.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in mediating various biological and pathological processes, involving transcriptional and gene regulation. The effects of dinotefuran on lncRNA expression and lncRNA function in the honey bee brain are still obscure. Results: Through RNA sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs was performed following exposure to 0.01 mg/L dinotefuran for 1, 5, and 10 d. In total, 312 lncRNAs and 1341 mRNAs, 347 lncRNAs and 1458 mRNAs, and 345 lncRNAs and 1155 mRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (DE) on days 1, 5 and 10, respectively.

Moreover, the DE lncRNA TCONS_00086519 was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to be distributed mainly in the cytoplasm, suggesting that it may serve as a competing endogenous RNA and a regulatory factor in the immune response to dinotefuran.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of the biopesticide azadirachtin on the survival, behavior, morphology, development, and reproduction of queens of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese, 1900). The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a toxic reference standard. Queens were orally exposed in vitro to a contaminated diet (containing azadirachtin and imidacloprid) during development. Azadirachtin resulted in reduced survival, similarly to imidacloprid, altered development time, caused deformations, and reduced the size of the queens‚Äô reproductive organs. All of these factors could potentially compromise colony survival. Results from the present study showed azadirachtin posed a toxicological hazard to P. helleri queens. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2018.03.030,201,,550,556,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043383248&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2018.03.030&partnerID=40&md5=015f35349e7dd40efcd8763e8c6faf88,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,180

Data show that field-realistic concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect both population density and the fitness of solitary bees. However, the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using an established semi-field experimental set-up and Osmia cornuta as a solitary bee model, we examined the effects of field-realistic concentrations of a common neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin) on male larvae and adults. Besides measuring lethal (i.e., overwintering success and adult survival) and sub-lethal endpoints (i.e., emergence mass and emergence duration), we examined, for the first time, potential effects on the male reproductive physiology of a solitary bee (i.e., sperm quantity and viability). The data revealed no significant effects on any of the measured response variables. This may be due to the low degree of clothianidin exposure (0.56 ng g‚àí1) and/or the apparent low susceptibility of solitary bee larvae to neonicotinoids. Furthermore, it is conceivable that ideal foraging conditions, combined with optimal weather and lack of other environmental stressors, may have improved the ability of bees to cope with the insecticide. To reliably assess and understand the environmental hazards of agrochemicals, a holistic approach, including laboratory, semi-field and field data is required.

Bioinformatic analysis indicated that AccCacyBP was highly conserved and closely related to the CacyBP of other insects. Promoter analysis revealed a number of putative tissue, development and stress-related transcription factor-binding sites. RT-qPCR demonstrated that AccCacyBP was expressed at all of the stages of development, especially in the brains of honeybees. Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of AccCacyBP in the brain.

We examined for the first time the multidimensional effects of field-realistic concentrations of two common neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) on drone honeybee survival, behaviour and physiology using individuals reared and maintained as adults in the field. Our data showed that neonicotinoids reduced honeybee drone survival by 51%, increased drifting behaviour to non-maternal colonies by 100%, delayed flight activities by 3¬†days and reduced number of living sperm by 28%. However, they did not influence the sperm concentration produced by the drones, the strength of the drone's maternal colonies or the total number of drones produced by those colonies.

In the laboratory, male and female solitary bees Osmia cornuta were exposed to four concentrations of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam to measure survival, food consumption, and sperm traits. Despite males being exposed to higher dosages of thiamethoxam, females revealed an overall increased hazard rate for survival; suggesting sex-specific differences in toxicological sensitivity. All tested sublethal concentrations (i.e., 1.5, 4.5 and 10 ng g‚àí1) reduced sperm quantity by 57% and viability by 42% on average, with the lowest tested concentration leading to a reduction in total living sperm by 90%.

However, the defence responses of A. cerana cerana to different stressors are poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism mediated by the tumorous imaginal discs (Tid) protein of A. cerana cerana (AccTid) in response to stressors. Methods: We used some bioinformatics softwares to analyse the characterisation of Tid. Then, qRT‚ÄìPCR, RNA interference and heat resistance detection assays were used to explore the function of Tid in stress response in A. cerana cerana. Results: AccTid is a homologous gene of human Tid1 and Drosophila Tid56, contains a conserved J domain and belongs to the heat shock protein DnaJA subfamily. The level of AccTid induced expression was increased under temperature increases from 40¬∞C to 43¬∞C and 46¬∞C, and AccTid knockdown decreased the heat resistance of A. cerana cerana, indicating that the upregulation of AccTid plays an important role when A. cerana cerana is exposed to heat stress. Interestingly, contrary to the results of heat stress treatment, the transcriptional level of AccTid was inhibited by cold, H2O2 and some agrochemical stresses and showed no significant change under ultraviolet ray and sodium arsenite stress. These results suggested that the requirement of A. cerana cerana for Tid differs markedly under different stress conditions. In addition, knockdown of AccTid increased the mRNA levels of some Hsps and antioxidant genes. The upregulation of these Hsps and antioxidant genes may be a functional complement of AccTid knockdown.

Although the exact underlying mechanisms of honeybee (Apis mellifera) CCD have not yet been confirmed, we postulated that mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) damage in honeybees resulting from sublethal neonicointoids exposure could be a plausible cause leading to malfunctioning thermoregulation. In this study, we used the relative mitochondrial DNA copy number (RmtDNAcn) as an early biomarker to elucidate the association between chronic sublethal neonicotinoids exposure and mtDNA damage in honeybees. We collected adult worker bees from hives that were either served as controls or exposed to a sub-lethal level of imidacloprid or clothianidin in three different brood generations that coincided with before, during, and after neonicotinoids treatments. Although there were no apparent adverse health effects in individual bees or the whole colony during and after neonicotinoids administration, the cumulative mtDNA damage in winter bees might have negatively impacted their hives' survival over winter due to the perturbation of energy metabolism. These results contribute to the explanation of a potential mechanism of CCD.",2020/04/14/,2020,10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00070,7,4,254,258,,,,2328-8930,WOS:000526328600006,,0,,1,195

Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

The contribution of the neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., clothianidin and imidacloprid) to this decline is controversial, and key to understanding their risk is whether the astonishingly low levels found in the nectar and pollen of plants is sufficient to deliver neuroactive levels to their site of action: the bee brain. Here we show that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris audax) fed field levels [10 nM, 2.1 ppb (w/w)] of neonicotinoid accumulate between 4 and 10 nM in their brains within 3 days. Acute (minutes) exposure of cultured neurons to 10 nM clothianidin, but not imidacloprid, causes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent rapid mitochondrial depolarization. However, a chronic (2 days) exposure to 1 nM imidacloprid leads to a receptor-dependent increased sensitivity to a normally innocuous level of acetylcholine, which now also causes rapid mitochondrial depolarization in neurons. Finally, colonies exposed to this level of imidacloprid show deficits in colony growth and nest condition compared with untreated colonies.

In honey bees, vitellogenin displays crucial functions in hormone signaling, behavioral transition of nurse bees to foragers, stress resistance, and longevity in workers. Plant protection products such as neonicotinoids, pyrethroids, and organophosphates alter the transcriptional expression of vitellogenin. To assess plant protection product-induced alterations on the protein level, we developed a rabbit polyclonal vitellogenin antibody. After characterization, we assessed its specificity and vitellogenin levels in different tissues of worker bees. The vitellogenin antibody recognized full-length 180-kDa vitellogenin and the lighter fragment of 150 kDa in fat body, hemolymph, and brain. In hemolymph, a band of approximately 75 kDa was detected. Subsequent mass spectrometric analysis (liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry) confirmed the 180- and 150-kDa bands as vitellogenin. Subsequently, we evaluated vitellogenin expression in brain, fat body, and hemolymph on 24-h exposure of bees to 3 ng/bee to the neonicotinoid clothianidin. Full-length vitellogenin was upregulated 3-fold in the fat body, and the 150-kDa fragment was upregulated in the brain of exposed honey bees, whereas no alteration occurred in the hemolymph. Upregulation of the vitellogenin protein by the neonicotinoid clothianidin is in line with the previously shown induction of its transcript. We conclude that vitellogenin might serve as a potential biomarker for neonicotinoid and other pesticide exposure in bees.

Furthermore, contamination of bee flora with insecticide residue is another cause of honeybee mortality. The current study assessed the toxicity of five insecticides, namely bifenthrin (Talstar (R) 10EC), endosulfan (Thiodon (R) 35EC), imidacloprid (Confidor (R) 200SL), ethofenprox (Trebon (R) 30EC) and diafenthiuron (Polo (R) 500SC) against haemocytes of the honeybee, A. mellifera under standard laboratory conditions. Analysis for counts of total haemocytes, differential haemocytes, and abnormalities was determined for larvae, pupae, and adult worker bees of A. mellifera. The haemolymph samples were assessed soon after, 30 and 60 min for selected insecticides applied at a concentration of recommended field doses. The total count of haemocytes was found to be significantly maximum in larval and pupal stages (35818 cells/mm(3), 3387 cells/mm(3)) while lowest (5493 cells/mm(3)) in adult workers, but differential counts of haemocytes remained somewhat insignificant for all insecticides applied. Variation of total haemocytes count of honeybee resulted for all tested insecticides. Results revealed an increase in haemocytes count (6662 cells/mm(3), 7237 cells/mm(3), 7081 cells/mm(3)) of adult honeybees exposed to diafenthiuron, ethofenprox, and imidacloprid soon after application; however, these counts dropped (4506 cells/mm(3), 4262 cells/mm(3), 3481 cells/mm(3), 4325 cells/mm(3)) after sixty minutes of application for all tested insecticides except for bifenthrin when compared with the untreated adult honeybee. While for differential count, granulocytes and plasmatocyte numbers increased in adult worker A. mellifera after the application of insecticides. Haemocytes immune response to insecticides exhibited abnormalities of various degrees, such as denucleation, cell shape distortion and agglutination.

Here we measured 28 biometrical, biochemical and behavioural indicators in a field study with 63 colonies and 3 apiaries. Colonies were stressed in early summer by feeding them for five days with either the carbamate growth regulator fenoxycarb or the neurotoxic neonicotinoid imidacloprid, or left untreated. Candidate stress indicators were measured 8‚Äì64 days later. We determined which of the indicators were influenced by the treatments, and which could be used as predictors in regression analyses of overwintering strength. Among the indicators influenced by fenoxycarb were the amount of brood in colonies as well as the learning performance and 24¬†h-memory of bees, and the concentration of the brood food component 10HDA in head extracts. Imidacloprid significantly affected honey production, total number of bees and activity of the immune-related enzyme phenoloxidase in forager bee extracts. Indicators predictive of overwintering strength but unrelated to insecticide feeding included vitellogenin titer and glucose oxidase-activity in haemolymph/whole body-extracts of hive bees. Apart from variables that were themselves components of colony strength (numbers of bees/brood cells), the only indicator that was both influenced by an insecticide and predictive of overwintering strength was the concentration of 10HDA in worker bee heads. Our results show that physiological and biochemical bioassays can be used to study effects of insecticides at the colony level and assess the vitality of bee colonies. At the same time, most bioassays evaluated here appear of limited use for predicting pesticide effects on colony overwintering strength, because those that were sensitive to the insecticides were not identical with those that were predictive of colony overwintering. Our study therefore illustrates the difficulties involved in evaluating the economic/ecological significance of pesticide-induced stress in honey bee field studies. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016///,2016,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.06.038,132,,379,389,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84976630167&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2016.06.038&partnerID=40&md5=2f3b5b08a2253fcb03155d02fdd42cde,Scopus,,,,,0,,1,200

We investigated the susceptibility of Tetragonisca fiebrigi to sublethal concentrations of insecticides fipronil, malathion, and thiamethoxam (administered through contact and ingestion) by determining the LC50 values after 24 hours of exposure and analyzing changes in the activity of esterase isoenzymes and the chromatin in brain cells. The LC50 values showed that all three insecticides were highly toxic through contact and ingestion. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the relative EST-4 (carboxylesterase) activity in T. fiebrigi was partially inhibited by malathion and fipronil ingestion. Moreover, the EST-4 band intensity was increased following high-concentration thiamethoxam (contact) exposure, indicating the increased relative activity of this isoenzyme to detoxify the compound. In the cytochemical analysis of brain cells, the critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) points for the control stingless bees and malathion ingestion-exposed and thiamethoxam-exposed (contact and ingestion) stingless bees were in the range of 0.20-0.30 M MgCl2, whereas that for malathion contact-exposed bees was 0.15 M MgCl2, indicating chromatin relaxation and suggesting an increase in gene expression.

To understand the nature and properties of the nAChRs involved in these processes, we performed a pharmacological and molecular characterization of nAChRs on cultured Kenyon cells of the MBs, using whole cell patch-clamp recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR. In all cells, applications of ACh as well as nicotinic agonists such as nicotine and imidacloprid induced inward currents with fast desensitization. These currents were fully blocked by saturating doses of the antagonists alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT), dihydroxy-beta-erythroidine (DHE), and methyllycaconitine (MLA) (MLA >= alpha-BGT >= DHE).

Royal jelly or larval food are produced by the hypopharyngeal gland of nursing bees and contain unusually high ACh concentrations (4-8 mM). ACh is extremely well conserved in royal jelly or brood food because of the acidic pH of 4.0. This condition protects ACh from degradation thus ensuring delivery of intact ACh to larvae. Raising the pH to >= 5.5 and applying cholinesterase reduced the content of ACh substantially (by 75-90%) in larval food. When this manipulated brood was tested in artificial larval breeding experiments, the survival rate was higher with food supplemented by 100% with ACh (6 mM) than with food not supplemented with ACh. ACh release from the hypopharyngeal gland and its content in brood food declined by 80%, when honeybee colonies were exposed for 4 weeks to high concentrations of the neonicotinoids clothianidin (100 parts per billion [ppb]) or thiacloprid (8,800 ppb). Under these conditions the secretory cells of the gland were markedly damaged and brood development was severely compromised. Even field-relevant low concentrations of thiacloprid (200 ppb) or clothianidin (1 and 10 ppb) reduced ACh level in the brood food and showed initial adverse effects on brood development. Our findings indicate a hitherto unknown target of neonicotinoids to induce adverse effects on non-neuronal ACh which should be considered when re-assessing the environmental risks of these compounds. To our knowledge this is a new biological mechanism, and we suggest that, in addition to their well documented neurotoxic effects, neonicotinoids may contribute to honeybee colony losses consecutive to a reduction of the ACh content in the brood food.",2016/06/10/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0156886,11,6,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000377564000029,,0,,1,207
261,JOUR,Chronic exposure to insecticides impairs honeybee optomotor behaviour,"['Parkinson, R.H.', 'Fecher, C.', 'Gray, J.R.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Honeybees use wide-field visual motion information to calculate the distance they have flown from the hive, and this information is communicated to conspecifics during the waggle dance. Seed treatment insecticides, including neonicotinoids and novel insecticides like sulfoxaflor, display detrimental effects on wild and managed bees, even when present at sublethal quantities. These effects include deficits in flight navigation and homing ability, and decreased survival of exposed worker bees. Neonicotinoid insecticides disrupt visual motion detection in the locust, resulting in impaired escape behaviors, but it had not previously been shown whether seed treatment insecticides disrupt wide-field motion detection in the honeybee. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to two commonly used insecticides, imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid) and sulfoxaflor, results in impaired optomotor behavior in the honeybee. This behavioral effect correlates with altered stress and detoxification gene expression in the brain. Exposure to sulfoxaflor led to sparse increases in neuronal apoptosis, localized primarily in the optic lobes, however there was no effect of imidacloprid. We propose that exposure to cholinergic insecticides disrupts the honeybee‚Äôs ability to accurately encode wide-field visual motion, resulting in impaired optomotor behaviors. These findings provide a novel explanation for previously described effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on navigation and link these effects to sulfoxaflor for which there is a gap in scientific knowledge.

However, sufloxaflor (SFX) is thought to act in a different manner and is thus proposed as an alternative in crop protection. The goal of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of SFX and its sublethal effect on the honeybee Apis mellifera after acute exposure. In toxicological assay studies, the LD50 value and sublethal dose (corresponding to the NOEL: no observed effect level) were 96 and 15 ng/bee, respectively. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we found that an SFX dose of 15 ng/bee significantly impairs learning and memory retrieval when applied 12 h before conditioning or 24 h after olfactory conditioning. SFX had no effect on honeybee olfactory performance when exposure happened after the conditioning. Relative quantitative PCR experiments performed on the six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits demonstrated that they are differently expressed in the honeybee brain after SFX exposure, whether before or after conditioning. We found that intoxicated bees with learning defects showed a strong expression of the AmelŒ≤1 subunit. They displayed overexpression of AmelŒ±9 and AmelŒ≤2, and down-regulation of AmelŒ±1, AmelŒ±3 and AmelŒ±7 subunits. These results demonstrated for the first time that a sublethal dose of SFX could affect honeybee learning and memory performance and modulate the expression of specific nAChR subunits in the brain. ¬© 2022 Public Library of Science.

While this phenomenon is partly attributed to neonicotinoids (NEOCs), chronic exposures to these insecticides at environmentally-relevant concentrations are needed to fully estimate their implications. In this study, honey bees were orally exposed for 10 days to low field-realistic concentrations of NEOCs known for their effects on the cholinergic system (imidacloprid ‚Äì IMI or thiamethoxam ‚Äì THM). Selected biomarkers were measured such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), Œ±-tocopherol as well as several forms of vitamin A (retinoids) and carotenoids. Bees exposed to IMI showed lower levels of two carotenoids (Œ±-carotene and Œ±-cryptoxanthin) and Œ±-tocopherol. The THM exposure increased the oxidized vitamin A metabolites in bees conjointly with the LPO. These results could be the consequence of a pro-oxidant effect of NEOCs and were observed at levels where no effects were recorded for AChE activity. This study reveals that exposure to low levels of NEOCs alters the carotenoid-retinoid system in honey bees. This would merit further investigation as these compounds are important in various aspects of bees‚Äô health. Overall, this study contributes to the development of biomonitoring tools for the health of bees and other pollinators. ¬© 2018, The Author(s).",2018///,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-34625-y,8,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056067652&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-34625-y&partnerID=40&md5=d023147184001268f7cd12722e43fe07,Scopus,,,0,,1,210

However, the body distribution of the compound after exposure to neonicotinoids in bumblebees is not well studied. Bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris, n = 20) were exposed to field-realistic concentrations of clothianidin through artificial nectar (3.6-13 mu g/L) for 9 d. Comparison of the nominal with the measured exposure in nectar indicated good compliance, confirming the applicability of the method. When quantified, clothianidin showed a concentration-dependent occurrence in the head and body of workers (head: <0.2-2.17 mu g/kg; body: <0.2-3.17 mu g/kg), and in the body of queens (<0.2-2.49 mu g/kg), although concentrations were below those measured in the nectar (bioaccumulation factor = 0.2). Exposure to clothianidin did not affect mortality nor brood production, nor did it have a statistically significant effect on nectar consumption and size of food storage. However, visual inspection suggests higher nectar consumption of nectar with low clothianidin content compared with nectar with no or high clothianidin content. Our results show that dietary clothianidin is taken up in bumblebees, but does not bioaccumulate to elevated levels compared with exposure. Still, clothianidin may elicit responses that affect feeding behavior of the pollinator B. terrestris, although our endpoints were not significantly affected. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-10.

Whole-cell currents were recorded using patch-clamp techniques. Pressure application of agonists induced inward currents in cultured Kenyon cells at holding potentials of -110 mV. Acetylcholine or carbamylcholine were full agonists, nicotine, epibatidine and cytisine were only partial agonists. Coapplications of these partial agonists with acetylcholine reduced the current amplitude. The most efficient antagonists were dihydroxy-Œ≤-erythroidine (EC50 = 0.5 pmol¬∑l-1) and methyllycaconitine (EC50 = 24 pmol¬∑l-1). The open channel blocker mecamylamine, d-tubocurarine and hexamethonium were rather weak blockers of the honeybee nicotinic response. Bath applications of the muscarinic antagonist atropine inhibited nicotinic currents dependent on concentration (EC50 = 24.3 Œºmol¬∑l-1). Muscarine, pilocarpine or oxotremorine (1 mmol¬∑l-1) did not induce any measurable currents. The non-cholinergic drugs strychnine, bicuculline and picrotoxin partially and reversibly blocked the acetylcholine-induced currents. Our results indicate the expression of only one nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype in cultured Kenyon cells.

In social insects, inclusive fitness depends on successful mating of reproductives, i.e. males and queens, and efficient collaborative brood care by workers. Therefore, interactive effects between malnutrition and environmental pollution on sperm and feeding glands (hypopharyngeal glands (HPGs)) would provide mechanisms for population declines, unless buffered against due to their fitness relevance. However, while negative effects for bumble bee colony fitness are known, the effects of malnutrition and insecticide exposure singly and in combination on individuals are poorly understood. Here we show, in a fully-crossed laboratory experiment, that malnutrition and insecticide exposure result in neutral or antagonistic interactions for spermatozoa and HPGs of bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, suggesting strong selection to buffer key colony fitness components. No significant effects were observed for mortality and consumption, but significant negative effects were revealed for spermatozoa traits and HPGs. The combined effects on these parameters were not higher than the individual stressor effects, which indicates an antagonistic interaction between both. Despite the clear potential for additive effects, due to the individual stressors impairing muscle quality and neurological control, simultaneous malnutrition and insecticide exposure surprisingly did not reveal an increased impact compared to individual stressors, probably due to key fitness traits being resilient. Our data support that stressor interactions require empirical tests on a case-by-case basis and need to be regarded in context to understand underlying mechanisms and so adequately mitigate the ongoing decline of the entomofauna.",2022/08/10/,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155098,833,,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pollen', 'adult', 'thiamethoxam', 'reproduction', 'Neonicotinoid', 'sperm', 'Pollen', 'male', 'Health', 'Bombus terrestris', 'fitness', 'Male', 'Reproduction', 'environmental stress', 'Insecta', 'population decline', 'Biodiversity', 'malnutrition', 'Malnutrition', 'animal structures', 'Hypopharyngeal gland', 'hypopharynx', 'Bumble bee', 'insect', 'Social insects', 'hypopharyngeal gland', 'Interaction', 'Spermatozoa', 'Environmental stressors', 'spermatozoon', 'Antagonistic interactions', 'Gland', 'Sperm', 'sperm function']",0048-9697,WOS:000805772900012,,0,,1,213

However, the lipids of their central nervous system have not been examined, even though they likely play a crucial role in the performance of cognitive process to perform intricate behaviors. Lipidomics has greatly advanced our understanding of neuropathologies in mammals and could provide the same for honey bees. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the brain lipidome of adult honey bees and to assess the effect of clothianidin (a neurotoxic insecticide) on the brain lipid composition, gene expression, and performance of self-grooming behavior under controlled conditions (cage experiments). Methods: After seven days of exposure to oral sublethal doses of clothianidin, the bees were assessed for self-grooming behavior; their brains were dissected to analyze the lipidome using an untargeted lipidomics approach and to perform a high throughput RNAseq analysis. Results: Compared to all other organisms, healthy bee brain lipidomes contain unusually high levels of alkyl-ether linked (plasmanyl) phospholipids (51.42%) and low levels of plasmalogens (plasmenyl phospholipids; 3.46%). This could make it more susceptible to the effects of toxins in the environment. A positive correlation between CL 18:3/18:1/14:0/22:6, TG 6:0/11:2/18:1, LPE 18:0e and intense self-grooming was found. Sublethal doses of a neonicotinoid altered PC 20:3e/15:0, PC 16:0/18:3, PA 18:0/24:1, and TG 18:1/18:1/18/1 levels, and affected gene expression linked to GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway and energy metabolism that may be partially responsible for the altered lipid composition. Conclusion: This study showed that lipidomics can reveal honey bee neuropathologies associated with reduced grooming behavior due to sublethal neonicotinoid exposure. The ease of use, unusual brain lipidome as well as characterized behaviors that are affected by the environment make honey bees a promising model organism for studying the neurolipidome and associations with neurobehavioral disorders. ¬© 2022",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.jare.2021.08.007,37,,,,75,89,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113674681&doi=10.1016%2fj.jare.2021.08.007&partnerID=40&md5=3402264eaea4aabfd4c6f44eec4b5507,Scopus,"['Brain', 'Grooming', 'Honey bees', 'Lipidome', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Social immunity']",,0,,1,214

Imidacloprid (IMD) is a pesticide used worldwide. No information exists on how IMD impact the bees‚Äô body bioelement balance, which is essential for bee health. We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

The ADS was upregulated in workers with age but downregulated in queens. Imidacloprid suppressed the ADS in all workers, particularly in foragers with an upregulated ADS, but it did not affect the ADS in 1-day-old queens. In contrast to foragers, the downregulated ADS of 2-year-old queens was unexpectedly highly upregulated by imidacloprid, which has not been previously shown in such old queens. The principal component analysis confirmed that queen and worker ADSs responded to imidacloprid in opposite ways, and ADS of 2-year-queens was markedly different from those of others. Thus, evolutionary shaped ADSs of older queens and workers may be of the limited use for foragers dwelling in pesticide ecosystems, but not for old queens. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

The paradox between the benefits that these animals represent to humans and the evidence of human activities driving their extinction calls for the urgent protection of bees. To address the role of chemical pollution in this scenario, we assessed the acute toxicity as well as four biomarker responses (cholinesterase [ChE], glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation [LPO]) elicited by dietary 24-h exposure to three insecticides (malathion, imidacloprid, and fipronil) on the stingless neotropical bee Tetragonisca angustula and the honeybee Apis mellifera. Malathion was the most toxic substance to both species, with 48-h median lethal doses (LD50s) of 0.25 ng/bee to A. mellifera and 0.02 ng/bee to T. angustula. Fipronil was also highly toxic and presented a similar toxicity to both species, with 48-h LD50s of 0.5 ng/bee (A. mellifera) and 0.4 ng/bee (T. angustula). Imidacloprid had the lowest acute toxicity with a 48-h LD50 of 29 ng/bee for A. mellifera, whereas T. angustula tolerated exposure higher than 35 ng/bee. Apparent biomarker responses were observed in bees of both species that survived exposure to higher concentrations of malathion (ChE inhibition) and fipronil (increased LPO). Our results suggest that specific sensitivity to insecticides varies greatly among compounds and pollinator species, but the use of different representative species can facilitate the prioritization of substances regarding their risk to pollinators. Further research is necessary to better characterize the risk that pesticides represent in neotropical agricultural landscapes.

The latter results in the frequent exposure of bumblebees to pesticides. We report here on a new bioassay that uses primary cultures of neurons derived from adult bumblebee workers to evaluate possible side-effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid. Mushroom bodies (MBs) from the brains of bumblebee workers were dissected and dissociated to produce cultures of Kenyon cells (KCs). Cultured KCs typically extend branched, dendrite-like processes called neurites, with substantial growth evident 24-48 h after culture initiation. Exposure of cultured KCs obtained from newly eclosed adult workers to 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) imidacloprid, an environmentally relevant concentration of pesticide, did not have a detectable effect on neurite outgrowth. By contrast, in cultures prepared from newly eclosed adult bumblebees, inhibitory effects of imidacloprid were evident when the medium contained 25 ppb imidacloprid, and no growth was observed at 2,500 ppb. The KCs of older workers (13-day-old nurses and foragers) appeared to be more sensitive to imidacloprid than newly eclosed adults, as strong effects on KCs obtained from older nurses and foragers were also evident at 2.5 ppb imidacloprid. In conclusion, primary cultures using KCs of bumblebee worker brains offer a tool to assess sublethal effects of neurotoxic pesticides in vitro.

Fipronil and imidacloprid are insecticides used worldwide to eliminate or control insect pests. Because they are broad-spectrum insecticides, they can also affect honeybees. Many researchers have studied the lethal and sublethal effects of these and other insecticides on honeybees, and some of these studies have demonstrated a correlation between the insecticides and colony collapse disorder in bees. The authors investigated the effects of fipronil and imidacloprid on the bioenergetic functioning of mitochondria isolated from the heads and thoraces of Africanized honeybees. Fipronil caused dose-dependent inhibition of adenosine 5'-diphosphate-stimulated (state 3) respiration in mitochondria energized by either pyruvate or succinate, albeit with different potentials, in thoracic mitochondria; inhibition was strongest when respiring with complex I substrate. Fipronil affected adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production in a dose-dependent manner in both tissues and substrates, though with different sensitivities. Imidacloprid also affected state-3 respiration in both the thorax and head, being more potent in head pyruvate-energized mitochondria; it also inhibited ATP production. Fipronil and imidacloprid had no effect on mitochondrial state-4 respiration. The authors concluded that fipronil and imidacloprid are inhibitors of mitochondrial bioenergetics, resulting in depleted ATP. This action can explain the toxicity of these compounds to honeybees.

Currently, the number of pollinators is decreasing worldwide, which is attributed mostly to the widespread use of pesticides. The aim of this work was to develop a method for assessing the genotoxicity of pesticides for the Bombus terrestris L. bumblebee using long-range PCR of mitochondrial DNA fragments. We have developed a panel of primers and assessed the genotoxicity of the following pesticides: imidacloprid, rotenone, deltamethrin, difenocanozole, malathion, metribuzin, penconazole, esfenvalerate, and dithianon. All pesticides (except imidacloprid) inhibited mitochondrial respiration fueled by pyruvate + malate; the strongest effect was observed for rotenone and difenocanozole. Three pesticides (dithianon, rotenone, and difenocanozole) affected the rate of H2O2 production. To study the pesticide-induced DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, we used three different mtDNA. The mtDNA damage was observed for all studied pesticides. Most of the studied pesticides caused significant damage to mtDNA in vitro and in vivo when ingested. Our results indicate that all tested pesticides, including herbicides and fungicides, can have a toxic effect on pollinators. However, the extent of pesticide-induced mtDNA damage in the flight muscles was significantly less upon the contact compared to the oral administration. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.104675,169,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089444308&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.104675&partnerID=40&md5=165343f8a589c2deeac699de35290eee,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bumblebees', 'DNA damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'Hydrogen Peroxide', 'Long-range PCR', 'Method', 'Mitochondria', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'mitochondrion', 'mtDNA', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollination', 'Pollination']",,0,,1,223
281,JOUR,Sulfoxaflor exposure reduces egg laying in bumblebees Bombus terrestris,"['Siviter, H.', 'Horner, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Sulfoximine-based insecticides, such as sulfoxaflor, are of increasing global importance and have been registered for use in 81 countries, offering a potential alternative to neonicotinoid insecticides. Previous studies have demonstrated that sulfoxaflor exposure can have a negative impact on the reproductive output of bumblebee colonies, but the specific life-history variables that underlie these effects remain unknown. Here, we used a microcolony-based protocol to assess the sub-lethal effects of chronic sulfoxaflor exposure on egg laying, larval production, ovary development, sucrose consumption, and mortality in bumblebees. Following a pre-registered design, we exposed colonies to sucrose solutions containing 0, 5, 10 and 250ppb of sulfoxaflor. Exposure at 5¬†ppb has been previously shown to negatively impact colony reproductive success. Our results showed that sulfoxaflor exposure at 5¬†ppb (lowest exposure tested) reduced the number of eggs found within the microcolonies (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.37), with exposed microcolonies also less likely to produce larvae (Hedge's d¬†=¬†‚àí0.36). Despite this, we found no effect of sulfoxaflor exposure on ovarian development. Sulfoxaflor-exposed bumblebees consumed less sucrose solution, potentially driving the observed reduction in egg laying. Policy implications. Regulatory bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are under increasing pressure to consider the potential impact of insecticides on wild bees, such as bumblebees, but sublethal effects can go undetected at lower-tier testing. In identifying just such an effect for bumblebees exposed to sulfoxaflor, this study highlights that microcolony-based protocols are a useful tool that could be implemented within an ecotoxicology framework. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for potentially negative consequences of pollinator exposure to an insecticide that is currently undergoing the licensing process in several EU member states. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

Whereas the preparation of active microsomal membranes from many pest insect species is straightforward, their isolation from honey bees, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) remained difficult, if not impossible, due to the presence of a yet unidentified endogenous inhibitory factor released during abdominal gut membrane isolation. Thus hampering in vitro toxicological studies on microsomal oxidative phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics, including compounds of ecotoxicological concern. The use of microsomal membranes rather than individually expressed P450s offers advantages and allows to develop a better understanding of phase 1 driven metabolic fate of foreign compounds. Here we biochemically investigated the problems associated with the isolation of active honey bee microsomes and developed a method resulting in highly active native microsomal preparations from adult female worker abdomens. This was achieved by removal of the abdominal venom gland sting complex prior to microsomal membrane preparation. Molecular sieve chromatography of the venom sac content leads to the identification of phospholipase A2 as the enzyme responsible for the immediate inhibition of cytochrome P450 activity in microsomal preparations. The substrate specificity of functional honey bee microsomes was investigated with different fluorogenic substrates, and revealed a strong preference for coumarin over resorufin derivatives. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate the metabolism of insecticides by honey bee microsomes using an approach coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis of hydroxylated metabolites. Our work provides access to a new and simple in vitro tool to study honey bee phase 1 metabolism of xenobiotics utilising the entire range of microsomal cytochrome P450s. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.014,161,,,,68,76,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065084111&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2019.04.014&partnerID=40&md5=fcecb464371b44cff9d79558f095a6dd,Scopus,,,0,,1,225

Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria, producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed. Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure were withdrawn, survival was maintained. Bees and insects generally cannot see deep red light so it does not disturb their behaviour. Hence, we show that deep red light exposure that improves mitochondrial function, reverses the sensory and motor deficits induced by Imidacloprid. These results may have important implications as light delivery is economic and can be placed in hives/colonies.",2016/11/15/,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0166531,11,11,1932-6203,WOS:000387794600077,,,,,,,0,,1,226

However, we have previously shown that mitochondrial damage induced by neonicotinoids can be corrected by 670nm light exposure. But we do not know if this protection extends to immunity or what the minimum effective level of 670nm light exposure is necessary for protection. We use whole body bee respiration in vivo as a metric of neonicotinoid damage and assess the amount of light exposure needed to correct it. We reveal that only 1 min of 670nm exposure is sufficient to correct respiratory deficits induced by pesticide and that this also completely repairs damaged immunocompetence measured by haemocyte counts and the antibacterial action of hemolymph. Further, this single 1 min exposure remains effective for 3‚Äì6 days. Longer exposures were not more effective.

In the first experiment, B. occidentalis colonies were exposed to realistic residue levels of CrylAc, chitinase, and imidacloprid found in pollen. There were no effects on pollen consumption, bumble bee worker weights, colony size, amount of brood, or the number of queens and males produced. In the second experiment, using B. impatiens, we tested the effects of CrylAc and two levels of imidacloprid. Similar colony health measures were collected as in the first experiment, but in addition foraging ability of individual bees was tested on complex artificial flowers. There were no differences in colony characteristics among treatments. However, bees in the high-imidacloprid treatment had longer handling times on the complex flowers than bees in the other treatments. No lethal, sublethal colony, or individual foraging effects of these novel pesticides were found at residue levels found in the field, suggesting that bumble bee colonies will not be harmed by proper use of these pesticides. Use of an artificial flower foraging array proved to be a sensitive method for detecting sublethal response of bees to pesticides.",2003///,2003,10.1603/0046-225X-32.3.555,32,3,555,563,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0037559519&doi=10.1603%2f0046-225X-32.3.555&partnerID=40&md5=555b033d33d1c592dbfb34fdcb354efb,Scopus,,,,,1,,0,235

Trade-offs between longevity and other traits may render long-living workers in brood-free periods more susceptible to pesticides compared to short-lived ones. Further, colony environment (e.g., adequate nutrition) may enable workers to better cope with pesticides, yet data comparing long vs. short-living workers and the role of the colony environment for pesticide tolerance are scarce. Here, we show that long-living honey bee workers, Apis mellifera, are less susceptible to the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam than short-lived workers, and that susceptibility was further reduced when workers were acclimatized under colony compared to laboratory conditions. Following an OECD protocol, freshly-emerged workers were exposed to thiamethoxam in summer and winter and either acclimatized within their colony or in the laboratory. Mortality and sucrose consumption were measured daily and revealed that winter workers were significantly less susceptible than summer workers, despite being exposed to higher thiamethoxam dosages due to increased food consumption. Disparencies in fat body activity, which is key for detoxification, may explain why winter bees were less susceptible. Furthermore, colony acclimatization significantly reduced susceptibility towards thiamethoxam in winter workers likely due to enhanced protein nutrition. Brood absence and colony environment seem to govern workers‚Äô ability to cope with pesticides, which should be considered in risk assessments. Since honey bee colony losses occur mostly over winter, long-term studies assessing the effects of pesticide exposure on winter bees are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1007/s10646-024-02758-8,33,6,608,621,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85193948446&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-024-02758-8&partnerID=40&md5=7503c10cfc68fdbc939e99db2b0deb24,Scopus,"['acclimation', 'acclimatization', 'Acclimatization', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behaviour', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'environmental exposure', 'Eusociality', 'fat pad', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticide', 'insecticide resistance', 'Insecticides', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nonhuman', 'OECD', 'organism colony', 'physiology', 'protein intake', 'risk assessment', 'season', 'Seasons', 'sucrose', 'sugar intake', 'summer', 'survival', 'Survival', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'winter', 'worker (insect)']",,,,1,,0,236

To explore potential colony-level effects of a neonicotinoid pesticide at field-relevant concentrations, honey bee colonies were fed 5- and 20-ppb concentrations of clothianidin in sugar syrup while control colonies were fed unadulterated syrup. Two experiments were conducted in successive years at the same site in southern Arizona, and one in the high rainfall environment of Mississippi. Across all three experiments, adult bee masses were about 21% lower among colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin than the untreated control group, but no effects of treatment on brood production were observed. Average daily hive weight losses per day in the 5-ppb clothianidin colonies were about 39% lower post-treatment than in the 20-ppb clothianidin colonies, indicating lower consumption and/or better foraging, but the dry weights of newly-emerged adult bees were on average 6‚Äì7% lower in the 5-ppb group compared to the other groups, suggesting a nutritional problem in the 5-ppb group. Internal hive CO2 concentration was higher on average in colonies fed 20-ppb clothianidin, which could have resulted from greater CO2 production and/or reduced ventilating activity. Hive temperature average and daily variability were not affected by clothianidin exposure but did differ significantly among trials.

Recently, interactive effects of multiple agrochemicals on bees have been highlighted, including fungicides, which increase toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides. Here, we use a semi-field study across two seasons in controlled foraging tunnels to test the effects of a field application of a commercial fungicide product with two active ingredients (pyraclostrobin and metconazole) applied at label rates. We also examine its interactive effects with the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin, at a conservative field-realistic dose of 2.23 ppb, on 48 honey bee colonies. We found combined effects of pesticide exposure, including additive 2.93-fold increases in mortality, and an additional effect of increased infestation levels of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor. Pesticide treatments also reduced colony activity, reduced colony weight, and increased sugar consumption of whole colonies.

327,JOUR,Temperature sensitive effects of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) foraging behaviour,"['Kolano, P.J.', 'Borg√•, K.', 'Nielsen, A.']",Journal of Pollination Ecology,"Pollinating insects are an inherent part of most terrestrial ecosystems as they provide a crucial service for most angiosperms, including numerous important crops. A decrease in pollinator populations can therefore have severe consequences for both natural ecosystems and agricultural yields. Pesticide usage has been pointed out as one of the drivers behind pollinator declines. Globally, neonicotinoids are one of the most commonly used insecticides and studies have shown that exposure at sublethal levels can alter foraging behaviour, ultimately negatively affecting survival. Using a custom-made bumblebee colony monitoring system, we examined how the number and duration of foraging bouts of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) on an individual level was affected by exposure to low (6.5 Œºg/L) and high (10.2 Œºg/L) sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid clothianidin via nectar. We also examined possible interaction between clothianidin exposure and abiotic factors (temperature and precipitation), and its impact on foraging bout number and duration. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of clothianidin increased foraging bout duration in bumblebees. Furthermore, the foraging bout duration decreased with increasing temperature at both exposure concentrations, whereas the unexposed control group was not affected by temperature. Neither number of foraging bouts nor the daily rhythm of foraging bout duration was affected by clothianidin exposure or temperature. The foraging bout duration decreased with increasing precipitation in both exposed and non-exposed groups. However, we did not find any interaction between precipitation and exposure, suggesting that precipitation does not affect toxicity. Our study shows the importance of semi-natural experiments and accounting for ambient factors when assessing the risk that pesticide exposure may present to pollinators. We conclude that the effect of clothianidin exposure on bumblebee foraging behaviour is temperature sensitive and that local climatic conditions and future climate change scenarios should be considered in risk assessments of clothianidin and other insecticides. ¬© 2021 Journal of Pollination Ecology.

294,JOUR,Chronic acetamiprid exposure moderately affects the foraging behaviour of buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris),"['T√≥th, Z.', 'Kov√°cs, Z.']",Ethology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators in both natural and agricultural ecosystems, but their survival and pollination service are threatened by extensive pesticide use. Due to regulation changes, acetamiprid has become the only neonicotinoid substance that can be used without restrictions and in open-field cultivations in the European Union. Yet, we know little about how this active ingredient affects bumblebees' foraging behaviour and if such effects are similarly detrimental to those of other neonicotinoids. Here we investigated how a 14-day-long (chronic) exposure to low (5 ppb) and high (2500 ppb) concentrations of acetamiprid in syrup affected different aspects of foraging behaviour in buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris, Linnaeus). We recorded individual foraging at artificial food patches during one-hour-long trials and then compared several foraging-related measures between differently dosed individuals. We found that 75.12% of the total syrup consumption occurred at the first-exploited patch, but individuals did not exhibit any bias toward pesticide-treated food patches. Chronic exposure to acetamiprid had little effect on individual foraging decisions at the first-exploited food patch but significantly affected the time to the first feeding and the number of feedings at the second-exploited patch in interaction with body mass. The duration of the first feeding was affected only by foragers' body mass. Our finding indicates that chronic exposure to a high but field-realistic concentration of acetamiprid may alter some aspects of bumblebees' foraging behaviour. If such behavioural changes accumulate during consecutive foraging bouts, chronic exposure to this pesticide might lead to a reduction of daily resource collection, ultimately jeopardising colony fitness or plant (crop) pollination. ¬© 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

However, the use of pesticides, such as thiamethoxam, has been identified as a contributing factor compromising bee health. The current risk assessment primarily relies on the model species Apis mellifera, raising concerns about the applicability of these assessments to other bee groups, including stingless bees. In this study, we investigated the acute toxicity of thiamethoxam on the stingless bee Frieseomelitta varia by determining the average lethal concentration (LC50) and mean lethal time (LT50). Additionally, we evaluated the enzymatic profile of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Carboxylesterase-3 (CaE-3), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST), in the heads and abdomens of F. varia after exposure to thiamethoxam (LC50/10). The LC50 of thiamethoxam was determined to be 0.68 ng ai/ŒºL, and the LT50 values were 37 days for the control group, 25 days at LC50/10, and 27 days at LC50/100. The thiamethoxam significantly decreased the survival time of F. varia. Furthermore, the enzymatic profile exhibited differences in CaE3 activity within one day in the heads and ten days in the abdomen. GST activity showed differences in the abdomen after one and five days of thiamethoxam exposure. These findings suggests that the abdomen is more affected than the head after oral exposure to thiamethoxam. Our study provides evidence of the toxicity of thiamethoxam at both the cellular and organismal levels, reinforcing the need to include non-Apis species in pollinator risk assessments. and provide solid arguments for bee protection. ¬© 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142853,363,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85198568641&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2024.142853&partnerID=40&md5=9de40d691e254e0b9c40ceb789d2ef0f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pollution exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'Risks assessments', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'survival analysis', 'toxicity', 'Sublethal effects', 'thiamethoxam', 'acute toxicity', 'Neonicotinoid', 'stingless bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'sublethal concentration', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'metabolism', 'LC50', 'acetylcholinesterase', 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'biological marker', 'Biomarkers', 'enzyme activity', 'survival time', 'biomarker', 'glutathione transferase', 'biochemical oxygen demand', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'Glutathione S-transferases', 'carboxylesterase', 'And acetylcholinesterase', 'And AChE', 'Biomarker assessment', 'Cae3', 'CaE3', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Friesiomelitta varia', 'GST', 'practice guideline', 'Survival time']",,,,0,detox genes,0,241

Honey bees get exposed to systemic pesticides while foraging in contaminated fields, and it is important to know the toxicity (LD50) and evaluate the impacts of bees' exposure to these molecules. Fipronil and imidacloprid are systemic pesticides widely used in Brazil and other countries. The objective of this study was to determine the LD50 (24 hours) and evaluate motor changes in Africanized honey bee foragers exposed to lethal and sublethal doses of fipronil and imidacloprid. To determine the LD50, foraging honey bees were exposed by ingestion and contact to five doses of fipronil (Regent 800WG¬∞) and imidacloprid (Appalus 200SC¬∞) insecticides. After 24 hours of exposure, the number of dead bees was counted, and the results were subjected to probit analysis. The motor activity of bees exposed by ingestion or contact to LD50 and sublethal doses (1/500th of the LD50) of both pesticides was assessed 4 hours after exposure using a behavioral observation box. The ingestion and contact with LD50 of fipronil were 0.0528¬±0.0090 and 0.0054¬±0.0041 Œºg/bee, respectively; the ingestion and contact with LD50 of imidacloprid were 0.0809¬±0.0135 and 0.0626¬±0.0080 Œºg/bee, respectively.

Several potential factors have been studied as possible causes of declining pollinator health, such as parasites and pathogens, exposure to agricultural pesticides, habitat loss and/or climate change. More recently, a combination of these factors rather than a single cause have been blamed for observed pollinator losses, but field studies of such interactions are challenging, especially in the presence of confounding environmental stressors. We therefore examined the impact of single and combined stressors on the honey bee (Apis mellifera) in a generally healthy Australian population. We exposed workers during their larval development and drones until they reached sexual maturity to the neonicotinoid pesticide Thiamethoxam, at concentrations more than 20 times lower than we initially measured in the field, the microsporidian gut pathogen Nosema apis or both stressors at the same time. We found that simultaneous exposure significantly reduced bee health. We observed a substantial increase in mortality and a reduction of immunocompetence in workers exposed to both the pathogen and the pesticide. We conclude that the exposure of generally healthy bees to multiple environmental stressors results in synergistic effects where the effects are expected to negatively impact performance and could be sufficient to trigger colony collapse. We found that the vast majority of males did not survive to sexual maturity after exposure to very low levels of Thiamethoxam.

Cell Line AmE-711 to Evaluate Insecticide Toxicity,"['Goblirsch, M.', 'Adamczyk, J.J.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"One of the main contributors to poor productivity and elevated mortality of honey bee colonies globally is insecticide exposure. Whole-organism and colony-level studies have demonstrated the effects of insecticides on many aspects of honey bee biology and have also shown their interactions with pathogens. However, there is a need for in vitro studies using cell lines to provide greater illumination of the effects of insecticides on honey bee cellular and molecular processes. We used a continuous cell line established from honey bee embryonic tissues (AmE-711) in assays that enabled assessment of cell viability in response to insecticide exposure. We exposed AmE-711 cells to four formulations, each containing a different insecticide. Treatment of cells with the insecticides resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in viability after a 24-h exposure, whereas long-term exposure (120 h) to sublethal concentrations had limited effects on viability. The 24-h exposure data allowed us to predict the half-maximal lethal concentration (LC50) for each insecticide using a four-parameter logistical model. We then exposed cells for 12 h to the predicted LC50 and observed changes in morphology that would indicate stress and death. Reverse transcription‚Äìquantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis corroborated changes in morphology: expression of a cellular stress response gene, 410087a, increased after an 18-h exposure to the predicted LC50. Demonstration of the effects of insecticides through use of AmE-711 provides a foundation for additional research addressing issues specific to honey bee toxicology and complements whole-organism and colony-level approaches. Moreover, advances in the use of AmE-711 in high-throughput screening and in-depth analysis of cell regulatory networks will promote the discovery of novel control agents with decreased negative impacts on honey bees.

The total consumption of the contaminated diet was 23.63 ng fungicide/larvae (pyraclostrobin) and 0.2364 ng insecticide/larvae (clothianidin). The effects on post-embryonic development were evaluated over time. Additionally, we assessed the survival pattern of worker bees after emergence, and the pesticides‚Äô effects on the behavior of newly emerged workers and young workers. Young bees that were exposed to the fungicide and those subjected to co-exposure to both pesticides during larval phase showed behavioral changes. The insecticide, both in isolation and in combination with fungicide reduced the bees‚Äô longevity; this effect of larval exposure to pesticides was stronger in bees that were exposed only to the insecticide.

Insect metamorphosis and response to external stress are altered by deleting CYP450 genes. In this study, we identified and analyzed a novel gene of CYP450 family, AccCYP6A13, from Apis cerana cerana, and explored its role in the response of Apis cerana cerana to adverse external stressors. It was found that the expression of AccCYP6A13 was spatiotemporal specificity. The expression level increased with age and reached its highest value in the adult stage. The primarily expressiong location were legs, brain, and epidermis of honeybees. Stress conditions can affect the expression of AccCYP6A13 depending on treatment times. RNA interference experiments have shown that knocking down AccCYP6A13 reduces antioxidant activity and deactivates detoxification enzymes, resulting in oxidative damage accumulation and a decline in detoxification capability in bees, as well as inhibiting numerous antioxidant genes. Additionally, knockdown of the AccCYP6A13 gene in Apis cerana cerana resulted in increased sensitivity to pesticides and increased mortality when treated with neonicotinoid pesticides such as thiamethoxam. AccCYP6A13 overexpression in a prokaryotic system further confirmed its role in resistance to oxidative stress. To summarize, AccCYP6A13 may play an essential role in the normal development and response to environmental stress in Apis cerana cerana. Furthermore, this study contributed to the theoretical understanding of bee resistance biology. ¬© 2024",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105890,202,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85192702662&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2024.105890&partnerID=40&md5=e0382c2d3624c819cdddc8efb484e28b,Scopus,"['AccCYP6A13', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis cerana cerana', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'cytochrome P450', 'genetics', 'insect protein', 'Insect Proteins', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'metabolism', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid pesticides', 'Neonicotinoids', 'oxidative stress', 'Oxidative stress', 'Oxidative Stress', 'physiological stress', 'RNA interference', 'RNA Interference', 'Stress, Physiological', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam']",,0,,0,249

Here, we first investigated the metabolisation kinetics of thiamethoxam in chronically fed honeybees. We show that thiamethoxam, at a dose of 0.25 ng/bee/day, is quickly and effectively metabolised into clothianidin, throughout a 20 day exposure period. Using a similar chronic exposure to pesticide, we then studied, in a separate experiment, the impact of thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) co-exposure in honeybees. The honeybees were exposed to the virus by contact, mimicking the natural transmission route in the hive. We demonstrate that a high dose of thiamethoxam (5.0 ng/bee/day) can cause a synergistic increase in mortality in co-exposed honeybees after 8 to 10 days of exposure, with no increase in viral loads. At a lower dose (2.5 ng/bee/day), there was no synergistic increase of mortality, but viral loads were significantly higher in naturally dead honeybees, compared with sacrificed honeybees exposed to the same conditions. These results show that the interactions between pathogens and pesticides in honeybees can be complex: increasing pesticide doses may not necessarily be linked to a rise in viral loads, suggesting that honeybee tolerance to the viral infection might change with pesticide exposure. ¬© 2017 The Authors",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.10.009,144,,10,18,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032947686&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2017.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=bbc1f6310fbf6616ceff7aef1bb8dca8,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,252

Several potentially contributing factors have been investigated, e.g. parasites, diseases, and pesticides. Neonicotinoid pesticides have received much attention due to their intensive use in crop protection, and their adverse effects on many levels of honey bee physiology led the European Union to ban these compounds. Due to their neuronal target, a receptor expressed throughout the insect nervous system, studies have focused mainly on neuroscience and behaviour. Through the Geometric Framework of nutrition, we investigated effects of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on survival, food consumption and sucrose sensitivity of honey bees (Apis mellifera). Thiamethoxam did not affect protein and carbohydrate intake, but decreased responses to high concentrations of sucrose. Interestingly, when bees ate fixed unbalanced diets, dietary protein facilitated better sucrose detection. Both thiamethoxam and dietary protein influenced survival. These findings suggest that, in the presence of a pesticide and unbalanced food, honey bee health may be severely challenged. Consequences for foraging efficiency and colony activity, cornerstones of honey bee health, are also discussed. ¬© 2016 D√©mares et al.

The use of biopesticides, like spinosad, is preferred as an alternative method to control pests, because it is considered safer to non-target insects. In this study, we evaluated the lethal and sublethal effects of the spinosad-based formulation Tracer¬Æ on foragers of the stingless bee Plebeia lucii Moure (Apidae: Meliponini). Groups of bees were fed a pure diet (negative control) or a diet at different concentrations of spinosad. Positive control groups consisted of bees orally exposed to a diet with the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. Next, flight behavior, body mass, and respiration rate were evaluated in surviving bees. The results showed that bees¬¥ survival was reduced by all concentrations of spinosad, when compared with the negative control. Bee locomotion‚Äîwalking and flight‚Äîwas reduced in accordance with the increase in spinosad concentrations; however, body mass and respiration rate were not altered. Our results show that the use of Tracer¬Æ in ecosystems visited by P. lucii can reduce forager bee survival and reduce their locomotion, generating a negative impact on pollination services provided by these bees. ¬© 2020, Sociedade Entomol√≥gica do Brasil.",2020///,2020,10.1007/s13744-020-00766-x,49,4,578,585,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083981940&doi=10.1007%2fs13744-020-00766-x&partnerID=40&md5=455a8b74633648a3c1c635e0b90e66ea,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'drug effect', 'toxicity', 'flying', 'Ecotoxicology', 'toxicity testing', 'locomotion', 'Flight, Animal', 'Locomotion', 'biological control agent', 'Biological Control Agents', 'Brazil', 'drug combination', 'Drug Combinations', 'macrolide', 'Macrolides', 'organic farming', 'Plebeia', 'pollinator decline', 'spinosad', 'Toxicity Tests']",,,,0,,0,254

Sulfoxaflor is a new systemic insecticide that, like neonicotinoids, acts as a modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In agro-environments, bees can be exposed to this compound via contaminated pollen and nectar for long periods of time. Therefore, it is important to assess the potential effects of chronic exposure to sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with fungicides, on pollinators. In this study, we tested the effects of chronic exposure to two field concentrations of sulfoxaflor (20 and 100 ppb) alone and in combination with four concentrations of the fungicide fluxapyroxad (7500, 15,000, 30,000 and 60,000 ppb) on syrup consumption and longevity in females of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. Exposure to 20 ppb of sulfoxaflor, alone and in combination with the fungicide, stimulated syrup consumption, but did not affect longevity. In contrast, syrup consumption decreased in bees exposed to 100 ppb, all of which died after 2‚Äì6 days of exposure. We found no evidence of synergism between the two compounds at any of the two sulfoxaflor concentrations tested. Comparison of our findings with the literature, confirms that O. bicornis is more sensitive to sulfoxaflor than honey bees.

Here we report our recent investigation on how imidacloprid, one of the major neonicotinoids, affects worker bees by profiling the transcriptomes of various ages of bees exposed to different doses of imidacloprid during the larval stage. The results show that imidacloprid treatments during the larval stage severely altered the gene expression profiles and may induce precocious foraging. Differential expression of foraging regulators was found in 14-day-old treated adults. A high transcriptome similarity between larvae-treated 14-day-old adults and 20-day-old controls was also observed, and the similarity was positively correlated with the dose of imidacloprid.

The tests were carried out in vitro under artificial conditions (caged bees). A conclusively lower mortality rate and, in parallel, a higher average food intake, were observed in intoxicated bees treated using a mixture of phenolic acids and flavonoids compared to untreated intoxicated bees. This was probably caused by increased detoxification capacity caused by increased expression level of genes encoding the cytochrome P450 enzyme in the bees. Therefore, the addition of polyphenols into bee nutrition is probably able to positively affect the detoxification capacity of bees, which is often reduced by the impact of malnutrition resulting from degradation of the environment and common beekeeping management. ¬© 2021 by the authors.

Among these insecticides, thiacloprid, a commonly used compound with low toxicity, has attracted significant attention due to its potential impact on the olfactory and learning abilities of honeybees. The effect of sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid on the antennal activity of adult honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) is not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, laboratory-based experiments were conducted in which honeybee larvae were administered thiacloprid (0.5¬†mg/L and 1.0¬†mg/L). Using electroantennography (EAG), the impacts of thiacloprid exposure on the antennal selectivity to common floral volatiles were evaluated. Additionally, the effects of sub-lethal exposure on odor-related learning and memory were also assessed. The results of this study reveal, for the first time, that sub-lethal larval exposure to thiacloprid decreased honeybee antenna EAG responses to floral scents, leading to increased olfactory selectivity in the high-dose (1.0¬†mg/L) group compared to the control group (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.042). The results also suggest that thiacloprid negatively affected odor-associated paired learning acquisition, as well as medium-term (1¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.019) and long-term memory (24¬†h) (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.037) in adult honeybees. EAG amplitudes were dramatically reduced following R-linalool paired olfactory training (0¬†mg/L vs. 1.0¬†mg/L: p = 0.001; 0¬†mg/L vs. 0.5¬†mg/L: p = 0.027), while antennal activities only differed significantly in the control between paired and unpaired groups. Our results indicated that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of thiacloprid may affect olfactory perception and learning and memory behaviors in honeybees. These findings have important implications for the safe use of agrochemicals in the environment.

250,JOUR,Assessment of chronic sublethal effects of imidacloprid on honey bee colony health,"['Dively, G.P.', 'Embrey, M.S.', 'Kamel, A.', 'Hawthorne, D.J.', 'Pettis, J.S.']",PLoS ONE,"Here we present results of a three-year study to determine the fate of imidacloprid residues in hive matrices and to assess chronic sublethal effects on whole honey bee colonies fed supplemental pollen diet containing imidacloprid at 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg over multiple brood cycles. Various endpoints of colony performance and foraging behavior were measured during and after exposure, including winter survival. Imidacloprid residues became diluted or non-detectable within colonies due to the processing of beebread and honey and the rapid metabolism of the chemical. Imidacloprid exposure doses up to 100 Œºg/kg had no significant effects on foraging activity or other colony performance indicators during and shortly after exposure. Diseases and pest species did not affect colony health but infestations of Varroa mites were significantly higher in exposed colonies. Honey stores indicated that exposed colonies may have avoided the contaminated food. Imidacloprid dose effects was delayed later in the summer, when colonies exposed to 20 and 100 Œºg/kg experienced higher rates of queen failure and broodless periods, which led to weaker colonies going into the winter. Pooled over two years, winter survival of colonies averaged 85.7, 72.4, 61.2 and 59.2% in the control, 5, 20 and 100 Œºg/kg treatment groups, respectively. Analysis of colony survival data showed a significant dose effect, and all contrast tests comparing survival between control and treatment groups were significant, except for colonies exposed to 5 Œºg/kg. Given the weight of evidence, chronic exposure to imidacloprid at the higher range of field doses (20 to 100 Œºg/kg) in pollen of certain treated crops could cause negative impacts on honey bee colony health and reduced overwintering success, but the most likely encountered high range of field doses relevant for seed-treated crops (5 Œºg/kg) had negligible effects on colony health and are unlikely a sole cause of colony declines. ¬© 2015, Public Library of Science.

They have been found abundantly in the beehive, particularly in pollen. Few studies have analysed effects on honeybee larvae, and little is known about effects of insecticide-fungicide-mixtures, although this is a highly realistic exposure scenario. We asked whether the combination of a frequently used insecticide and fungicides would affect developing bees. Honeybee larvae (Apis mellifera carnica) were reared in vitro on larval diets containing different PPPs at two concentrations, derived from residues found in pollen. We used the neonicotinoid acetamiprid, the combined fungicides boscalid/dimoxystrobin and the mixture of all three substances. Mortality was assessed at larval, pupal, and adult stages, and the size and weight of newly emerged bees were measured. The insecticide treatment in higher concentrations significantly reduced larval and adult survival. Interestingly, survival was not affected by the high concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture. However, negative synergistic effects on adult survival were caused by the low concentrated insecticide-fungicides-mixture, which had no effect when applied alone. The lower concentrated combined fungicides led to significantly lighter adult bees, although the survival was unaffected. Our results suggest that environmental relevant concentrations can be harmful to honeybees. To fully understand the interaction of different PPPs, more combinations and concentrations should be studied in social and solitary bees with possibly different sensitivities. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124643,360,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201208997&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.124643&partnerID=40&md5=d04e5777776999dec4278c9d6af6fef8,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollution exposure', 'Apis mellifera', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'larva', 'Larva', 'Neonicotinoid', 'mortality', 'growth, development and aging', 'food intake', 'pollution effect', 'unclassified drug', 'in vitro study', 'nontarget organism', 'fungicide', 'LC50', 'Synergistic effect', 'Fungicides', '2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'dimoxystrobin', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Non-SBI fungicide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergism', 'microflora', 'Plant protection products', 'Biphenyl Compounds', 'biphenyl derivative', 'Niacinamide', 'nicotinamide', 'humidity', 'royal jelly', 'antifungal agent', 'binocular vision', 'body composition', 'environmental decision making', 'food composition', 'food industry', 'fungus growth', 'health care cost', 'In vitro larval rearing', 'In-vitro', 'Larval diet', 'methylbenzethonium chloride', 'Realistic exposure scenario', 'size', 'voriconazole', 'weight']",,,,0,,0,261

Honey bees have been experiencing high mortality in both the United States and worldwide. Pesticide exposure has been identified as one of the many stressors causing this mortality. Effects of various pesticides have been measured for multiple responses such as learning, memory performance, feeding activity, and thermoregulation. These studies were conducted at many different temperatures (11‚Äì35¬∞C); however, few studies compared toxicity of the same pesticide to bees at different temperatures. It is possible that the same pesticide might show different toxicity to honey bees at different temperatures. To reveal such potential interactions, we administered low doses of two neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) at three different temperature scenarios (35¬∞C, 24¬∞C, and a varying temperature) and determined the effects on honey bee survivorship. We discovered that honey bees are much more sensitive to the neonicotinoid pesticides imidacloprid and thiamethoxam at a constant 24¬∞C or at a varying temperature (night at 13¬∞C and day at 24¬∞C) compared to bees at 35¬∞C. These results suggest that honey bee colonies during winter time will be more sensitive to pesticides. Doses of neonicotinoids that are safe to colonies during summer might kill them during the winter time. ¬© Copyright ¬© 2020 Saleem, Huang and Milbrath.",2020///,2020,10.3389/fevo.2020.556856,8,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094974071&doi=10.3389%2ffevo.2020.556856&partnerID=40&md5=96393f67192eeaf30752b6c6e672c30f,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'neonicotinoids', 'overwintering bees', 'pesticide toxicity', 'temperature']",,,,0,,0,262

Several factors including agrochemicals can affect honey bee health including habitat fragmentation, pesticide application, and pests. The growing human population and subsequent increasing crop production have led to widespread use of agrochemicals and there is growing concern that pollinators are being negatively impacted by these pesticides. The present study compares acute exposure to imidacloprid (0.2 and 0.4 mgL‚àí1), ethion (80 and 106.7 mgL‚àí1) or glyphosate (0.12 and 0.24 mgL‚àí1) on aversive learning and movement, to chronic exposure at these and higher concentrations on movement, circadian rhythms, and survival in honey bee foragers. For acute learning studies, a blue/yellow shuttle box experiment was conducted; we observed honey bee choice following aversive and neutral stimuli. In learning studies, control bees spent >50% of the time on yellow which is not consistent with previous color bias literature in the subspecies or region of the study. The learning apparatus was also used to estimate mobility effects within 20 min of exposure. Chronic exposure (up to 2 weeks) with the above metrics was recorded by an automated monitoring system. In chronic exposure experiments, RoundUp¬Æ, was also tested to compare to its active ingredient, glyphosate. We found that imidacloprid and ethion have negative impacts on aversive learning and movement following a single-dose and that chronic exposure effects were dose-dependent for these two insecticides. In contrast, glyphosate had no effect on learning and less of an effect on movement; RoundUp¬Æ showed dose-dependent results on circadian rhythmicity. Overall, the results suggest that short-term exposure to imidacloprid and ethion adversely affect honey bee foragers and chronic exposure to glyphosate may affect pollination success. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111108,204,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089267499&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111108&partnerID=40&md5=9cbd45dfe10ca45df14df9eba30305df,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'exposure', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pollination', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'Apoidea', 'drug effect', 'forager', 'learning', 'Learning', 'physiology', 'survival', 'concentration (composition)', 'lifespan', 'longevity', 'Longevity', 'short term exposure', 'aversive behavior', 'glycine', 'Glycine', 'glyphosate', 'Glyphosate', 'long term exposure', 'agrochemical', 'assessment method', 'lethality', 'ecotoxicity', 'Apis mellifera, imidacloprid', 'Aversive conditioning', 'circadian rhythm', 'crop production', 'ethion', 'Ethion', 'lethal concentration', 'motility', 'movement (physiology)', 'newborn', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds', 'phosphorothioic acid derivative']",,,,0,,0,264

One of the most debated factors proposed to be contributing to pollinator declines is exposure to pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, a widely used class of systemic insecticide. Also, newly emerging parasites and diseases, thought to be spread via contact with managed honeybees, may pose threats to other pollinators such as bumblebees. Compared to honeybees, bumblebees could be particularly vulnerable to the effects of stressors due to their smaller and more short-lived colonies. Here, we studied the effect of field-realistic, chronic clothianidin exposure and inoculation with the parasite Nosema ceranae on survival, fecundity, sugar water collection and learning using queenless Bombus terrestris audax microcolonies in the laboratory. Chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin had no significant effects on the traits studied. Interestingly, pesticide exposure in combination with additional stress caused by harnessing bees for Proboscis Extension Response (PER) learning assays, led to an increase in mortality. In contrast to previous findings, the bees did not become infected by N. ceranae after experimental inoculation with the parasite spores, suggesting variability in host resistance or parasite virulence. However, this treatment induced a slight, short-term reduction in sugar water collection, potentially through stimulation of the immune system of the bees. Our results suggest that chronic exposure to 1 ppb clothianidin does not have adverse effects on bumblebee fecundity or learning ability.",2016/03/22/,2016,10.7717/peerj.1808,4,,,,,,,2167-8359,WOS:000372862600003,,0,,0,265

Since most of the native species do not present economic importance, they may suffer ‚Äúsilent extinction‚Äù, due to lack of monitoring of their colonies. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the lethal and sublethal concentrations of the insecticide thiamethoxam, with evaluation of its sublethal effects on mobility, in the stingless bee Plebeia catamarcensis (Holmberg, 1903). Foraging bees were collected and exposed to thiamethoxam to determine lethal (LC50) and sublethal concentrations. The 24 h LC50 was 0.408 ng a.i./ŒºL, a value demonstrating that this species may be as sensitive as other stingless bees already studied. Sublethal concentrations influenced the locomotion abilities of the bees, making them hyperactive when exposed to LC50/10 and lethargic when exposed to LC50/100. The effects of sublethal concentrations on individuals may have collective consequences, especially in colonies with few individuals, as is the case of P. catamarcensis. The findings reinforce the hypothesis that thiamethoxam may contribute to the decline of native stingless bees, which can be significantly impacted when chronically exposed to agricultural production systems that use this insecticide, consequently affecting the ecosystem services provided by these bees. ¬© 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.122742,339,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174156779&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2023.122742&partnerID=40&md5=b11e6ff1c2d4787a31cbcd7b6c05115f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'human', 'Humans', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'toxicity', 'foraging', 'concentration (composition)', 'thiamethoxam', 'Apidae', 'stingless bee', 'ecosystem service', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'locomotion', 'sublethal concentration', 'long term exposure', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystems', 'Pollinators', 'Pollinator', 'LC50', 'Agriculture', 'environmental impact', 'Exposed to', 'Ecosystem services', 'LC100', 'biodiversity', 'Biodiversity', 'aphid', 'agricultural production', 'Agricultural productions', 'lethargy', 'Meliponine', 'Native species', 'Plebeia catamarcensis']",,,,0,,0,266

Sublethal doses of neurotoxic pesticides that target cholinergic signaling can alter the behavior of insects in subtle ways; their influence on non-target organisms may not be readily apparent in simple mortality studies. Beneficial arthropods such as honeybees perform sophisticated behavioral sequences during foraging that, if influenced by pesticides, could impair foraging success and reduce colony health. Here, we investigate the behavioral effects on honeybees of exposure to a selection of pesticides that target cholinergic signaling by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). To examine how continued exposure to AChE inhibitors affected motor function, we fed adult foraging worker honeybees sublethal concentrations of these compounds in sucrose solution for 24 h. Using an assay for locomotion in bees, we scored walking, stopped, grooming, and upside down behavior continuously for 15 min. At a 10 nM concentration, all the AChE inhibitors caused similar effects on behavior, notably increased grooming activity and changes in the frequency of bouts of behavior such as head grooming. Coumaphos caused dose-dependent effects on locomotion as well as grooming behavior, and a 1 RM concentration of coumaphos induced symptoms of malaise such as abdomen grooming and defecation. Biochemical assays confirmed that the four compounds we assayed (coumaphos, aldicarb, chlorpyrifos, and donepezil) or their metabolites acted as AChE inhibitors in bees. Furthermore, we show that transcript expression levels of two honeybee AChE inhibitors were selectively upregulated in the brain and in gut tissues in response to AChE inhibitor exposure. The results of our study imply that the effects of pesticides that rely on this mode of action have subtle yet profound effects on physiological effects on behavior that could lead to reduced survival.",2013///,2013,10.3389/fphys.2013.00013,4,,,,,,,1664-042X,WOS:000346774000013,,0,,0,267

There is little evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties, but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on the likelihood of such effects under field conditions.

Oral and indirect contact trials were carried out on adult worker honey bees for each pesticide, using commercial formulations. The acute oral toxicity (AOT) LD50 and the acute indirect contact toxicity (ICT) LC50 were calculated. Mean AOT LD50 values at 24 hours (clothianidin 3.53 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 118.74 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.40 ng/honey bee), 48 hours (clothianidin 3.35 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 90.09 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.27 ng/honey bee), and 72 hours (clothianidin 3.28 ng/honey bee; imidacloprid 69.68 ng/honey bee; thiamethoxam 4.16 ng/honey bee) from test start were of the same order of magnitude of those reported in the literature for all three neonicotinoids. Statistically significant differences emerged in a few instances between groups of honey bees coming from the different hives tested for clothianidin, between the groups of honey bees coming from the single A. m. mellifera hive and the four A. m. ligustica hives tested for imidacloprid, and more extensively between the two A. m. carnica, the single A. m. mellifera, and the six A. m. ligustica groups of honey bees tested for thiamethoxam.

Nevertheless statistically significant differences were observed for clothianidin and thiamethoxam, but not for imidacloprid.

The majority of studies examining the effect of neonicotinoids on bees have focussed on social species, namely honey bees and bumble bees. However, most bee species are solitary, their life histories differing considerably from these social species, and thus it is possible that their susceptibility to pesticides may be quite different. Studies that have included solitary bees have produced mixed results regarding the impact of neonicotinoid exposure on survival and reproductive success. While the majority of studies have focused on the effects of adult exposure, bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here we examined the effect of exposure of Osmia bicornis larvae to a range of field-realistic concentrations (0-10 ppb) of the neonicotinoid clothianidin, observing no effect on larval development time, overwintering survival or adult weight. Flow-through respirometry was used to test for latent effects of larval exposure on adult physiological function. We observed differences between male and female bees in the propensity to engage in discontinuous gas exchange; however, no effect of larval clothianidin exposure was observed. Our results suggest that previously reported adverse effects of neonicotinoids on O. bicornis are most likely mediated by impacts on adults. ¬© 2017 Nicholls et al.",2017///,2017,10.7717/peerj.3417,2017,6,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020861689&doi=10.7717%2fpeerj.3417&partnerID=40&md5=f591527a971125c87ffd223a6df69469,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,271

Furthermore, chronic and acute exposure risk and risk ranking for humans eating honey were investigated, and risks to bees were also considered. The results revealed that 40.8% of the samples contained at least one of the five neonicotinoids tested. Honeys from commercial crops were found to be more frequently contaminated with neonicotinoids than those from noncommercial crops. Honey samples from Apis mellifera were more frequently contaminated than those from Apis cerana.

In insects, these neonicotinoid insecticides are known to act on acetylcholine nicotinic receptors but the behavioral effects of low doses are not yet fully understood. The effects of acetamiprid and thiamethoxam were studied after acute sublethal treatment on the behavior of the honeybee (Apis mellifera) under controlled laboratory conditions. The drugs were either administered orally or applied topically on the thorax. After oral consumption acetamiprid increased sensitivity to antennal stimulation by sucrose solutions at doses of 1 Œºg/bee and impaired long-term retention of olfactory learning at the dose of 0.1 Œºg/bee. Acetamiprid thoracic application induced no effect in these behavioral assays but increased locomotor activity (0.1 and 0.5 Œºg/bee) and water-induced proboscis extension reflex (0.1, 0.5, and 1 Œºg/bee).

Through direct consumption of contaminated nectar and pollen from treated plants, neonicotinoids can affect foraging, learning, and memory in worker bees. Less well studied are the potential effects of neonicotinoids on queen bees, which may be exposed indirectly through trophallaxis, or food-sharing. To assess effects on queen productivity, small colonies of different sizes (1500, 3000, and 7000 bees) were fed imidacloprid (0, 10, 20, 50, and 100 ppb) in syrup for three weeks. We found adverse effects of imidacloprid on queens (egg-laying and locomotor activity), worker bees (foraging and hygienic activities), and colony development (brood production and pollen stores) in all treated colonies. Some effects were less evident as colony size increased, suggesting that larger colony populations may act as a buffer to pesticide exposure. This study is the first to show adverse effects of imidacloprid on queen bee fecundity and behavior and improves our understanding of how neonicotinoids may impair short-Term colony functioning. These data indicate that risk-mitigation efforts should focus on reducing neonicotinoid exposure in the early spring when colonies are smallest and queens are most vulnerable to exposure. ¬© The Author(s) 2016.",2016///,2016,10.1038/srep32108,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84984690386&doi=10.1038%2fsrep32108&partnerID=40&md5=e4a56e5fa82ba7e8148aa6852c92504d,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,275

However, extensive residues of these pesticides in the soil, water, and pollen have negatively affected the health of nontarget organisms, especially among pollinators such as bumblebees. As an important pollinator, the bumblebee plays a vital role in agricultural production and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. Previous research has focused on the effects of a single pesticide on pollinating insects; however, the synergistic effects of multiple agents on bumblebees have been not studied in detail. Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos are three of common pesticides known for severe effects on bumblebee health. It is still unknown what synergistic effects of these pesticides on pollinators. In our test, the individual and combined toxicities of chlorpyrifos, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid to bumblebees after 48 h of oral administration were documented by the equivalent linear equation method. Our results showed that the toxicity of each single pesticide exposure, from high to low, was imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and chlorpyrifos. All binary and ternary combinations showed synergistic or additive effects. Therefore, our research not only shows that the mixed toxicity of insecticides has a significant effect on bumblebees, but also provides scientific guidelines for assessing the safety risks to bumblebees of these three insecticide compounds.

The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain. Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of ""Sivanto"" against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees, although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar. Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects. Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors studied here. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).",2018///,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-23200-0,8,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044320599&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-018-23200-0&partnerID=40&md5=78ee33baade1711826230f3c51e59252,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,278

Studies have found that these enzymes show peroxidase-like activity and may thus be involved in protecting organisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this work, Apis cerana cerana was used to investigate the molecular mechanisms of P450 family genes in resisting ROS damage. A cytochrome P450 gene was isolated, AccCYP336A1. The open reading frame (ORF) of AccCYP336A1 is 1491 by in length and encodes a predicted protein of 496 amino acids. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccCYP336A1 shared a high sequence identity with homologous proteins and contained the highly conserved features of this protein family. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that AccCYP336A1 was present in some fast developmental stages and had a higher expression in the epidermis than in other tissues. Additionally, the expression levels of AccCYP336A1 were up-regulated by cold (4 degrees C), heat (42 degrees C), ultraviolet (UV) radiation, H2O2 and pesticide (thiamethoxam, deltamethrin, methomyl and phoxim) treatments. These results were confirmed by the western blot assays. Furthermore, the recombinant AccCYP336A1 protein acted as an antioxidant that resisted paraquat-induced oxidative stress. Taken together, these results suggest that AccCYP336A1 may play a very significant role in antioxidant defense against ROS damage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Diets containing chemicals were fed to larvae with the range of concentrations for each compound based on published acute toxicity experiments and residues found in pollen and nectar, both components of the larval diet. RESULTS: Four concentrations of each compound and controls were tested: chlorpyrifos: 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 8 mg/L; clothianidin: 0.1, 0.4, 2, 10 mg L‚àí1; dimethoate: 0.02, 1, 6, 45 mg L‚àí1; imidacloprid: 0.4, 2, 4, 10 mg L‚àí1; positive control: dimethoate (45 mg L‚àí1); solvent control: acetone or methanol; and negative control.

To enable a realistic assessment of laboratory-reported effects of a combination of the insecticide thiacloprid and fungicide prochloraz on honey bees, a large-scale field study with spray application in winter oilseed rape was conducted in four regions in Germany. Several parameters were investigated, including mortality, flight activity, and colony development. Residue analysis of various materials (e.g., dead bees, nectar, and pollen) was conducted to assess exposure level. We observed several intoxication symptoms 2 h after application, including a high number of moribund bees and dead bees on the first day after application (DAA +1) compared to the control. Adverse effects were observed on the number of open brood cells, with a significant reduction of approximately 22% compared to control over the experimental period. High residue concentrations were detected on flowers and dead bees on the day of application, which decreased rapidly within six days. The residue concentrations detected were higher in bee-collected materials than in materials stored in the hive.

The aim of this work was to study the effects of imidacloprid in commercial Apis mellifera L. colonies artificially fed with syrups spiked with this insecticide and its possible transfer among in-hive products such as honey and larvae. For this purpose, 30 colonies were placed in the same apiary; once a week for 7¬†weeks in early spring, each colony was fed with 0.5 L of syrup with the following doses of imidacloprid: 0, 15, 30, 120, and 240¬†¬µg¬†kg‚àí1. The colony strength was evaluated by monitoring: the number of adult bees and brood combs, queenlessness, unhealthy colonies (by detection of Nosema spp. spores and European foulbrood), as well as pollen and honey storage. Worker bees, larvae, honey, and beeswax were sampled to evaluate imidacloprid transfer within the hive. Trends in the persistence of the compound showed that up to 60% of the parent (not metabolized) was stored in honey, and the absence of residues in the larvae suggests that they were not exposed. Another result showed a certain impact in the honey reserves and honey yield with a reduction of this resource in the colonies exposed to imidacloprid. ¬© 2023, INRAE, DIB and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",2023///,2023,10.1007/s13592-023-00993-2,54,2,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85148884284&doi=10.1007%2fs13592-023-00993-2&partnerID=40&md5=010500999f96964fcab3a6bd75c944fa,Scopus,"['aphid', 'Apis mellifera L', 'climate change', 'Colony strength', 'dose-response relationship', 'honey', 'honeybee', 'imidacloprid', 'Imidacloprid', 'pesticide residue', 'Residues', 'spring (season)', 'Sublethal doses', 'sublethal effect']",,,,0,,0,283

Furthermore, bees may be exposed in the field to multiple agrochemicals through different routes, thus suggesting the necessity for more comprehensive toxicological experiments. Here, we assessed the lethal and sublethal toxicity of multiple agrochemicals (herbicide [glyphosate ‚Äì Roundup¬Æ], fungicide [mancozeb], insecticide [thiamethoxam]) through distinct routes of exposure (contact or ingestion) to an endangered native Brazilian bee Melipona (Michmelia) capixaba Moure & Camargo, 1994 and to A. mellifera. Results indicate that none of the agrochemicals caused feeding repellency on the bees. Thiamethoxam caused high mortality of both species, regardless of the route of exposure or the dose used. In addition, thiametoxam altered the flight capacity of M. capixaba when exposed to the lowest dose via contact exposure. The field dose of glyphosate caused high mortality of both bee species after oral exposure as well as impaired the flight capacity of A. mellifera (ingestion exposure) and M. capixaba (contact exposure). The lower dose of glyphosate also impaired the flight of M. capixaba through either routes of exposure. Exposure of A. mellifera through contact and ingestion to both doses of mancozeb caused high mortality and significantly impaired flight capacity.

Here we test the hypothesis that exposure to acute, sublethal doses of neonicotinoid insecticides reduce thermal tolerance in honey bees. We administered to bees oral doses of imidacloprid and acetamiprid at 1/5, 1/20, and 1/100 of LD50 and measured their heat tolerance 4 h post-feeding, using both dynamic and static protocols. Contrary to our expectations, acute exposure to sublethal doses of both insecticides resulted in higher thermal tolerance and greater survival rates of bees. Bees that ingested the higher doses of insecticides displayed a critical thermal maximum from 2 ÃäC to 5 ÃäC greater than that of the control group, and 67%‚Äì87% reduction in mortality. Our study suggests a resilience of honey bees to high temperatures when other stressors are present, which is consistent with studies in other insects. We discuss the implications of these results and hypothesize that this compensatory effect is likely due to induction of heat shock proteins by the insecticides, which provides temporary protection from elevated temperatures. ¬© 2022 Gonzalez et al",2022///,2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0240950,17,02-Feb,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125415378&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0240950&partnerID=40&md5=62002621cbb1141c42864400df3a6956,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'Pollination', 'drug effect', 'honeybee', 'physiology', 'survival rate', 'sublethal dose', 'short term exposure', 'high temperature', 'climate change', 'LD50', 'mortality rate', 'pilot study', 'physiological stress', 'heat shock protein', 'critical thermal maximum', 'heat tolerance', 'Climate Change', 'Thermotolerance']",,,,0,,0,285

Sulfoxaflor is a recently developed systemic insecticide in the new sulfoximine class of insecticides and has shown high efficiency against a wide range of pest insects. The main objective of this study was therefore to assess the effects of sulfoxaflor on the buff-tailed or large earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), known as an important generalist pollinator of wild plants and many agricultural crops worldwide. To achieve this objective, a laboratory bioassay with queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B. terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B. terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 ¬µg/ml to 5 and 1 ¬µg/ml) via oral exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in general. ¬© 2019 E.

138,JOUR,Combined pesticide exposure severely affects individual- and colony-level traits in bees,"['Gill, RJ', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, O', 'Raine, NE']",NATURE,"Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production(1-3). Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations(4-6). Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour(7-11) and reductions in colony queen production(12). However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level(8), it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging(13-15), yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated(16,17). Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail.",2012/11/01/,2012,10.1038/nature11585,491,7422,105,U119,,,,0028-0836,WOS:000310434500039,,0,,0,287

At the highest doses, we observed larvae and pupae with shorter and longer development times, respectively, and the formation of smaller and asymmetric specimens. Evidently, we need to consider that thiamethoxam reaches the pollen and nectar at residual levels, and that they are processed by nurse bees before destined for offspring.

It has been demonstrated that low dosages of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid may affect honey bee, Apis mellifera L., behavior. In this article, the foraging behavior of the honey bee workers was investigated to show the effects of imidacloprid. By measuring the time interval between two visits at the same feeding site, we found that the normal foraging interval of honey bee workers was within 300s. However, these honey bee workers delayed their return visit for >300s when they were treated orally with sugar water containing imidacloprid. This time delay in their return visit is concentration-dependent, and the lowest effective concentration was found to be 50 /Œºg/liter. When bees were treated with an imidacloprid concentration higher than 1,200 /Œºg/liter, they showed abnormalities in revisiting the feeding site. Some of them went missing, and some were present again at the feeding site the next day. Returning bees also showed delay in their return trips.

168,JOUR,Positive correlation between pesticide consumption and longevity in solitary bees: Are we overlooking fitness trade-offs?,"['Strobl, V.', 'Camenzind, D.', 'Minnameyer, A.', 'Walker, S.', 'Eyer, M.', 'Neumann, P.', 'Straub, L.']",Insects,"The ubiquitous use of pesticides is one major driver for the current loss of biodiversity, and the common practice of simultaneously applying multiple agrochemicals may further contribute. Insect toxicology currently has a strong focus on survival to determine the potential hazards of a chemical routinely used in risk evaluations. However, studies revealing no effect on survival or even indicating enhanced survival are likely to be misleading, if potential trade-offs between survival and other physiological factors are overlooked. Here, we used standard laboratory experiments to investigate the sublethal (i.e., food consumption) and lethal (i.e., survival) effects of two common agricultural pesticides (Roundup¬Æ and clothianidin) on adult female solitary bees, Osmia bicornis. The data showed no significant effect of the treatment on cumulative survival; however, a significant positive correlation between herbicide and insecticide exposure and age was revealed, i.e., bees exposed to higher dosages lived longer. As no significant differences in daily food consumption were observed across treatment groups, increased food intake can be excluded as a factor leading to the prolonged survival. While this study does not provide data on fitness effects, two previous studies using solitary bees observed significant negative effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on fitness, yet not on survival. Thus, we conjecture that the observed non-significant effects on longevity may result from a trade-off between survival and reproduction. The data suggest that a focus on survival can lead to false-negative results and it appears inevitable to include fitness or at least tokens of fitness at the earliest stage in future risk assessments. ¬© 2020 by the authors.

160,JOUR,Impaired associative learning after chronic exposure to pesticides in young adult honey bees,"['Gonalons, C.M.', 'Farina, W.M.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoids are the most widespread insecticides in agriculture, preferred for their low toxicity to mammals and their systemic nature. Nevertheless, there have been increasing concerns regarding their impact on non-target organisms. Glyphosate is also widely used in crops and, therefore, traces of this pesticide are likely to be found together with neonicotinoids. Although glyphosate is considered a herbicide, adverse effects have been found on animal species, including honey bees. Apis mellifera is one of the most important pollinators in agroecosystems and is exposed to both these pesticides. Traces can be found in nectar and pollen of flowers that honey bees visit, but also in honey stores inside the hive. Young workers, which perform in-hive tasks that are crucial for colony maintenance, are potentially exposed to both these contaminated resources. These workers present high plasticity and are susceptible to stimuli that can modulate their behaviour and impact on colony state. Therefore, by performing standardised assays to study sublethal effects of these pesticides, these bees can be used as bioindicators. We studied the effect of chronic joint exposure to fieldrealistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and glyphosate on gustatory perception and olfactory learning. Both pesticides reduced sucrose responsiveness and had a negative effect on olfactory learning. Glyphosate also reduced food uptake during rearing. The results indicate differential susceptibility according to honey bee age. The two agrochemicals had adverse effects on different aspects of honey bee appetitive behaviour, which could have repercussions for food distribution, propagation of olfactory information and task coordination within the nest. ¬© 2018 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd | Journal of Experimental Biology.",2018///,2018,10.1242/jeb.176644,221,7,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045350300&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.176644&partnerID=40&md5=e57097603f1fcd42ba06cc7571845ede,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,291

The toxicity of fungicides based on thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil were investigated individually and in combination, and with the insecticides. Results showed that stingless bees were more susceptible to insecticides than honeybees. The commercial fungicides thiophanate-methyl or chlorothalonil caused low mortality, regardless of concentration; however, their combination was as toxic as imidacloprid to both species, and over 400-fold more toxic than deltamethrin for A. mellifera. There were highly synergistic effects on mortality caused by interactions in the mixture of imidacloprid and the fungicides thiophanate-methyl, chlorothalonil and the combined fungicide formulation in A. mellifera, and also to a lesser extent in P. helleri. By contrast, mixtures of the deltamethrin and the combined fungicide formulation induced high synergy in P. helleri, but had little effect on the mortality of A. mellifera.

161,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid exposure on bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) queen survival and nest initiation,"['Wu-Smart, J.', 'Spivak, M.']",Environmental Entomology,"Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival and nest founding in caged bumble bees [Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3, and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests. ¬© The Author(s) 2017.

These novel insecticides, such as flupyradifurone (FPF), remain relatively untested on non-target organisms, including bumblebees. Further, existing tests on honeybees tend to focus on adult mortality and thus sub-lethal effects, such as impacts on reproductive output, are neglected, despite their importance for population-level impacts. To address if the novel insecticide FPF has sub-lethal effects on bumblebee reproduction and behaviour, we established microcolonies and chronically exposed them to field-realistic concentrations over a 14-day period. We found that exposure to FPF reduced the bumblebees' reproductive output in terms of the number of larvae produced and the mean mass of each larval instar. FPF-treated bees also stored less sucrose and constructed fewer honeypots. However, adult bumblebee mortality was similar between control and FPF-exposed microcolonies. Our results show that field-realistic FPF exposure leads to increased larval mortality and/or delayed larval development, as well as reduced nectar storage, without affecting adult mortality. Policy implications. Insecticides that impair bumblebee reproduction can have long-term population-level consequences, even if adult bees do not experience increased mortality.

Among them, exposure to neonicotinoids has been getting more attention and has been considered as a main stressor. The Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.)

These two species are widely used in beekeeping, and many wild A. cerana is widely spread in forests and contributes to the ecosystem. It is predicated that A. cerana is more sensitive to insecticides than A. mellifera due to their smaller mass. Here, we found that although the body mass of A. cerana is significantly lower than A. mellifera, the sensitivity of the two species to neonicotinoids are not associated with their body mass but depended on the chemical structure of neonicotinoids. To dinotefuran, the two species showed the similar sensitivity. To acetamiprid, A. mellifera was less sensitive than A. cerana. However, to imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, A. mellifera was more sensitive than A. cerana. These results suggested that the sensitivity of honey bees to neonicotinoids is closely associated with the structure of pesticides, but not with body mass of bees.

Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long-term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field-realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life-time fitness performance of the red mason bee Osmia bicornis.

Increasing evidence suggests that sublethal toxicity of agricultural pesticides affects solitary bees differently than the social bees used to determine regulatory thresholds, such as honey bees and bumblebees. Studies on solitary bees are challenging because of the difficulties in obtaining large numbers of eggs or young larvae for bioassays. Here we show the toxic and sublethal developmental effects of four widely used plant systemic pesticides on the Japanese orchard bee (Osmia cornifrons). Pollen food stores of this solitary bee were treated with different concentrations of three insecticides (acetamiprid, flonicamid, and sulfoxaflor) and a fungicide (dodine). Eggs were transplanted to the treated pollen and larvae were allowed to feed on the pollen stores after egg hatch. The effects of chronic ingestion of contaminated pollen were measured until adult eclosion. This year-long study revealed that chronic exposure to all tested pesticides delayed larval development and lowered larval and adult body weights. Additionally, exposure to the systemic fungicide resulted in abnormal larval defecation and increased mortality at the pupal stage, indicating potential risk to bees from fungicide exposure. These findings demonstrate potential threats to solitary bees from systemic insecticides and fungicides and will help in making policy decisions to mitigate these effects. ¬© 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170048,915,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85183466833&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2024.170048&partnerID=40&md5=31920f7b38ffe8eb8f92def45271c3ea,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'Agricultural pesticides', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'body weight', 'Chemical contamination', 'controlled study', 'defecation', 'Exposed to', 'female', 'Food crops', 'fungicide', 'Fungicide', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'ingestion', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'Larval development', 'long term exposure', 'male', 'mortality', 'nonhuman', 'Orchard bee', 'Orchard bees', 'Orchards', 'Osmia', 'Osmia cornifrons', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'Pollinator', 'pupa', 'pupicidal activity', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Sublethal toxicity', 'survival rate', 'Systemic pesticides', 'toxicity', 'Toxicity', 'Toxicity exposure']",,,,0,,0,300

Besides increasing landscape fragmentation that limit the supply of flower resources, intensive agricultural practices relying on the use of pesticides to control agricultural pests also affect non-target organisms like honey bees. The use of most pesticides containing neonicotinoids has been severely restricted in the European Union, leaving pesticides containing acetamiprid as the only ones that are still authorized. In the meantime, new substances like sulfoxaflor, that have a similar mode of action acting on the insect's nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), have been approved for agricultural use. In Europe and USA, the use of pesticides containing this active ingredient is limited due to toxic effects already reported on bees, but no restrictions regarding this matter were applied in other countries (e.g., Brazil). In this study, homing ability tests with acetamiprid and sulfoxaflor were performed, in which honey bees were fed with three sub-lethal doses from each substance. After exposure, each honey bee was equipped with an RFID chip and released 1 km away from the colony to evaluate their homing ability. No significant effects were detected in honey bees fed with 32, 48 and 61 ng of acetamiprid while a poor performance on their homing ability, with only 28% of them reaching the colony instead of 75%, was detected at a 26 ng/a.s./bee dose of sulfoxaflor. Although, both pesticides act on the nAChR, the higher sulfoxaflor toxicity might be related with the honey bees detoxifying mechanisms, which are more effective on cyano-based neonicotinoids (i.e., acetamiprid) than sulfoximines. With this study we encourage the use of homing ability tests to be a suitable candidate to integrate the future risk assessment scheme, providing valuable data to models predicting effects on colony health that emerge from the individual actions of each bee. ¬© 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155710,837,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130185757&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.155710&partnerID=40&md5=ff6f430cc716ab62cc8cba0390be93e9,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetylcholine receptor', 'agricultural intensification', 'Agriculture', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Apis melifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'controlled study', 'detoxification', 'Eco-toxicology', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Europe', 'experimental study', 'Field experiment', 'Field experiments', 'Food products', 'Health risks', 'homing behavior', 'Homing failure', 'Honey bee', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lethal dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nicotinic acetylcholine', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'organism colony', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide exposure', 'Pesticides', 'Pesticides exposures', 'pollinator', 'pollution exposure', 'population exposure', 'prediction', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'radiofrequency identification', 'Receptors, Nicotinic', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal dose', 'sublethal effect', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'unclassified drug', 'United States']",,,,0,,0,302

During winter, honey bee colonies rely on stored honey and beebread, which is frequently contaminated with the neonicotinoid insecticides clothianidin and thiamethoxam. To determine whether neonicotinoid exposure affects overwinter survival of Apis mellifera L., we chronically exposed overwintering field colonies and winter workers in the laboratory to thiamethoxam or clothianidin at different concentrations and monitored survival and feed consumption. We also investigated the sublethal effects of chronic thiamethoxam exposure on colony pathogen load, queen quality, and colony temperature regulation. Under field conditions, high doses of thiamethoxam significantly increased overwinter mortality compared to controls, with field-realistic doses of thiamethoxam showing no significant effect on colony overwinter survival. Under laboratory conditions, chronic neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreased survival of winter workers relative to negative control at all doses tested. Chronic high-dose thiamethoxam exposure was not shown to impact pathogen load or queen quality, and field-realistic concentrations of thiamethoxam did not affect colony temperature homeostasis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that chronic environmental neonicotinoid exposure significantly decreases survival of winter workers in the laboratory, but only chronic high-dose thiamethoxam significantly decreases overwinter survival of colonies in the field. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

The medium and highest sublethal doses of clothianidin significantly reduced hygienic and foraging activity. The greatest effects were on the proportion of adult bees foraging and carrying pollen.

Even though there is consensus that neonicotinoid insecticides can impact non-target animal fertility, their possible impact on male mating success is currently unknown in bees. Here, we show that sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid significantly reduces both mating success and sperm traits of male bumblebees. Sexually mature male Bombus terrestris exposed to a field-realistic concentration of thiamethoxam (20 ng g‚àí1) or not (controls) were mated with virgin gynes in the laboratory. The results confirm sublethal negative effects of thiamethoxam on sperm quantity and viability. While the latency to mate was reduced, mating success was significantly impaired in thiamethoxam-exposed males by 32% probably due to female choice. Gynes mated by exposed males revealed impaired sperm traits compared to their respective controls, which may lead to severe constraints for colony fitness. Our laboratory findings demonstrate for the first time that neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect male mating success in bees. Given that holds true for the field, this provides a plausible mechanism contributing to declines of wild bee populations globally. The widespread prophylactic use of neonicotinoids may therefore have previously overlooked inadvertent anti-aphrodisiac effects on non-target animals, thereby limiting conservation efforts. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.12.003,9,,36,45,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121333656&doi=10.1016%2fj.toxrep.2021.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=9c8a52666298f54787e4ac0b40d754fe,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'nonhuman', 'honeybee', 'thiamethoxam', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'bumblebee', 'body mass', 'Neonicotinoid insecticide', 'mate choice', 'mating', 'mating success', 'fertility', 'egg laying', 'Sperm', 'aphrodisiac agent', 'Drone', 'Gyne', 'Mating']",,,,0,,0,310

Sublethal concentrations alter the behaviour of social bees and reduce survival of entire colonies. However, critics argue that the reported negative effects only arise from neonicotinoid concentrations that are greater than those found in the nectar and pollen of pesticide-treated plants. Furthermore, it has been suggested that bees could choose to forage on other available flowers and hence avoid or dilute exposure. Here, using a two-choice feeding assay, we show that the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, do not avoid nectar-relevant concentrations of three of the most commonly used neonicotinoids, imidacloprid (IMD), thiamethoxam (TMX), and clothianidin (CLO), in food. Moreover, bees of both species prefer to eat more of sucrose solutions laced with IMD or TMX than sucrose alone. Stimulation with IMD, TMX and CLO neither elicited spiking responses from gustatory neurons in the bees'mouthparts, nor inhibited the responses of sucrose-sensitive neurons. Our data indicate that bees cannot taste neonicotinoids and are not repelled by them. Instead, bees preferred solutions containing IMD or TMX, even though the consumption of these pesticides caused them to eat less food overall. This work shows that bees cannot control their exposure to neonicotinoids in food and implies that treating flowering crops with IMD and TMX presents a sizeable hazard to foraging bees. ¬© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, current methods for monitoring honeybee foraging activity and mortality are very approximate (visual records) or are time-limited and mostly based on single cohort analysis. We therefore assess the potential of bee counters, that enable a colony-level and continuous monitoring of bee flight activity and mortality, in pesticide risk assessment. After assessing the background activity and bee loss rates, we exposed colonies to two concentrations of sulfoxaflor (a neurotoxic insecticide) in sugar syrup: a concentration that was considered to be field realistic (0.59 Œºg/ml) and a higher concentration (2.36 Œºg/ml) representing a worst-case exposure scenario. We did not find any effect of the field-realistic concentration on flight activity and bee loss rates. However, a two-fold decrease in daily flight activity and a 10-fold increase in daily bee losses were detected in colonies exposed to the highest sulfoxaflor concentration as compared to before exposure. When compared to the theoretical trigger values associated with the specific protection goal of 7 % colony-size reduction, the observed fold changes in daily bee losses were often found to be at risk for colonies. In conclusion, the real-time and colony-level monitoring of bee loss rates, combined with threshold values indicating at which levels bee loss rates threaten the colony, have great potential for improving regulatory pesticide risk assessments for honeybees under field conditions. ¬© 2023",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163928,886,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158044301&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.163928&partnerID=40&md5=a069348fa254c4e8d76ca126a1d9d753,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee counter', 'Bees', 'chemical pollutant', 'colony', 'daily life activity', 'field study', 'Flight activity', 'Foraging activity', 'foraging behavior', 'honeybee', 'Honeybee colonies', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Loss rates', 'mortality', 'mortality rate', 'Mortality rate', 'Mortality rates', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'Population statistics', 'Protection goals', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'real time', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Specific protection goal', 'sucrose', 'sulfoxaflor', 'toxin', 'unclassified drug']",,,,0,,0,312

Honeybees are also subjected to additional chemical exposure when beekeepers treat hives with acaricides to combat the mite Varroa destructor. Here, we assess the effects of acute sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, and the organophosphate acaricide coumaphos, on honey bee learning and memory. Imidacloprid had little effect on performance in a six-trial olfactory conditioning assay, while coumaphos caused a modest impairment.

Both amitraz and thiacloprid have been proven less toxic to honey bees and are frequently applied in- and out-hive, respectively. We examined the sub-lethal effects of amitraz, thiacloprid and their sequential exposure on learning, memory and sugar responsiveness in Apis mellifera using the Proboscis extension response (PER). Sub-lethal doses of amitraz (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 ¬µg/bee) and thiacloprid (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 ¬µg/bee) were tested.

Increased honeybee mortality observed worldwide certainly contributes to this interest. The potential role of several neurotoxic insecticides in triggering or potentiating honeybee mortality was considered, in particular phenylpyrazoles and neonicotinoids, given that they are widely used and highly toxic for insects. Along with their ability to kill insects at lethal doses, they can compromise survival at sublethal doses by producing subtle deleterious effects. In this study, we compared the bee's locomotor ability, which is crucial for many tasks within the hive (e.g. cleaning brood cells, feeding larvae...), before and after an acute sublethal exposure to one insecticide belonging to the two insecticide classes, fipronil and thiamethoxam. Additionally, we examined the locomotor ability after exposure to pyrethroids, an older chemical insecticide class still widely used and known to be highly toxic to bees as well. Our study focused on young bees (day 1 after emergence) since (i) few studies are available on locomotion at this stage and (ii) in recent years, pesticides have been reported to accumulate in different hive matrices, where young bees undergo their early development. At sublethal doses (SLD48h, i.e. causing nomortality at 48h), three pyrethroids, namely cypermethrin (2.5 ng/bee), tetramethrin (70 ng/bee), tau-fluvalinate (33 ng/bee) and the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (3.8 ng/bee) caused a locomotor deficit in honeybees. While the SLD48h of fipronil (a phenylpyrazole, 0.5 ng/bee) had no measurable effect on locomotion, we observed high mortality several days after exposure, an effect that was not observed with the other insecticides. Although locomotor deficits observed in the sublethal range of pyrethroids and thiamethoxam would suggest deleterious effects in the field, the case of fipronil demonstrates that toxicity evaluation requires information on multiple endpoints (e.g. long term survival) to fully address pesticides risks for honeybees. Pyrethroid-induced locomotor deficits are discussed in light of recent advances regarding their mode of action on honeybee ion channels and current structure-function studies.",2015/12/14/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0144879,10,12,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000366715900130,,0,,0,315

Higher numbers of oenocytes, insect cells responsible for lipid processing and detoxification, were also found in pesticide-exposed larvae. Oenocytes are involved in hydrocarbon metabolism and chemical communication, and we hypothesized that these larvae could display altered cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles when exposed to pesticides as compared to control larvae. In addition, we proposed that these chemical cues could trigger specific behavioral responses in colony nurses. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed the CHC profiles of artificially reared larvae that had been fed sublethal doses of either dimethoate or clothianidin or fed on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found significant differences in the CHC profiles of these differently treated larvae. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, we transferred clothianidin-treated or LPS-treated larvae into the brood combs of surrogate colonies. Larvae that had been fed either the pesticide or LPS were removed at a significantly higher rate than control larvae.

Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on bumble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control, 0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg-1, during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment. At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild (0.2-0.8 mg kg-1) we detected minimal negative effects to bumble bee colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at 8.0 mg kg-1 spinosad, about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a 'worst case' field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg-1 were slower foragers on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad treated colonies.

Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure.

Yet, there is a concerning global trend of pollinator declines. Parasites and pesticides are among the suspected principle drivers of these declines. However, especially in the case of key wild pollinators, there are insufficient data on the relative impact of these individual environmental stressors and whether they interact to increase detrimental effects. Using a fully crossed factorial design, we investigated how laboratory exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, thiamethoxam and clothianidin, over a 9-week period and a prevalent trypanosome gut parasite Crithidia bombi affects various crucial colony traits of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We show that chronic dietary exposure from an early stage of colony development to doses of thiamethoxam and clothianidin that could be encountered in the field truncated worker production, reduced worker longevity and decreased overall colony reproductive success. Further, we demonstrate a significant interaction between neonicotinoid exposure and parasite infection on mother queen survival. The fate of the mother queen is intrinsically linked to colony success, and under combined pressure of parasite infection and neonicotinoid exposure, mother queen survival was lowest. This indicates increased detrimental effects of combined exposure on this crucial colony trait. Combined effects may be exacerbated in stressful natural environments where more pronounced parasite virulence is expected. Synthesis and applications. Our findings reiterate that dietary exposure to neonicotinoids can impact on bumblebee colony performance and fitness. The indication of combined negative effects of ecologically relevant pressures suggests additional adverse consequences for long-term population dynamics under complex field conditions.

We found that mean total pesticide load increased in hummingbird cloacal fluid, nectar, and flower samples following imidacloprid regulation. On average, we did not find evidence of a decrease in imidacloprid concentrations after regulation. However, there were some decreases, some increases, and other cases with no changes in imidacloprid levels depending on the specific media, time point of sampling, and site type. At the same time, we found an overall increase in flupyradifurone, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, and thiacloprid but no change in clothianidin concentrations. In particular, flupyradifurone concentrations observed in biota sampled near agricultural areas increased twofold in honey bee nectar, sevenfold in hummingbird cloacal fluid, and eightfold in flowers after the 2021 imidacloprid regulation.

Imidacloprid alters the number of trials needed to habituate the honeybee response to multiple sucrose stimulation. In 7-day-old bees, treatment with Imidacloprid leads to an increase in the number of trials necessary to abolish the response, whereas in 8-day-old bees, it leads to a reduction in the number of trials for habituation (15 min and 1 h after treatment), and to an increase 4 h after treatment. The temporal effects of Imidacloprid in both 7- and 8-day-old bees suggest that 4 h after treatment the observed effects are due to a metabolite of Imidacloprid, rather than to Imidacloprid itself. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct subtypes of nicotinic receptors in the honeybee that have different affinities to Imidacloprid and are differentially expressed in 7- and 8-day-old individuals. ¬© 2001 Academic Press.",2001///,2001,10.1006/nlme.2000.3995,76,2,183,191,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0034865712&doi=10.1006%2fnlme.2000.3995&partnerID=40&md5=a6cff1a94e1ba3c99e9917430d985061,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,327

Global concerns about declining bee populations due to agrochemical pollutants have, however, been biased towards the honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus. Here, we analysed the unintended effects of commercial formulations of a neonicotinoid insecticide, imidacloprid, and a fungicide mixture of thiophanate-methyl and chlorothalonil on color preference, respiration rates and group locomotory activities of both P. helleri and A. mellifera. Our results revealed that P. helleri foragers that were not exposed to pesticides changed their color preference during the course of a year. By contrast, we found that pesticide exposure altered the color preference of stingless bees in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, imidacloprid decreased the overall locomotion of both bee species, whereas the fungicide mixture increased locomotion of only stingless bees. The fungicide mixture also reduced respiration rates of forager bees of both species. Forager bees of both species altered their color preference, but not their locomotory and respiration rates, when exposed to commercial formulations of each fungicidal mixture component (i.e., chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl). Our findings emphasize the importance of P. helleri as a model for Neotropical wild pollinator species in pesticide risk assessments, and also the critical importance of including groups of agrochemicals that are often considered to have minimal impact on pollinators, such as fungicides. ¬© 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146432,779,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102623983&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.146432&partnerID=40&md5=e5fa57184c7f0df30994ae0bf9927166,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'Crops', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'concentration (parameter)', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'Food products', 'Imidacloprids', 'Pesticide effects', 'Meliponinae', 'Neotropics', 'stingless bee', 'Honey bee', 'locomotion', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'agrochemical', 'color', 'Color', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'nontarget organism', 'fungicide', 'Locomotion', 'agriculture', 'behavioral response', 'Behavioral response', 'Behavioral responses', 'breathing rate', 'chlorothalonil', 'Chlorothalonil', 'Color preferences', 'Exposed to', 'Fungicide exposure', 'Fungicides', 'Meliponini, apis mellifera', 'Meliponini, Apis mellifera', 'Mixtures', 'Native plants', 'Partamona helleri', 'preference behavior', 'respiration', 'Respiration rate', 'Respiratory Rate', 'thiophanate methyl']",,,,0,,0,328

In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a member of the alpha-crystallin/sHSP family, termed AccHsp27.6, was isolated from Apis cerana cerana. The full-length cDNA is 1,014 bp in length and contains a 708-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 236 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 27.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.53. Seven putative heat shock elements and three NF-kappa B binding sites were present in the 5'-flanking region, suggesting a possible function in immunity. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that AccHsp27.6 was expressed in all tested tissues and at different developmental stages. Furthermore, expression of the AccHsp27.6 transcript was induced by exposure to heat shock, H2O2, a number of different chemicals (including SO2, formaldehyde, alcohol, acetone, chloroform, and the pesticides phoxime and acetamiprid), and the microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus. In contrast, the mRNA expression could be repressed by CO2, the pesticides pyriproxyfen and cyhalothrin, and the microbes Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Emergent honeybees received a daily dose of insecticide ranging from one-fifth to one-five-hundredth of the median lethal dose (LD50) during 11 d. After exposure to fipronil (0.1 and 0.01 ng/bee), acetamiprid (1 and 0.1 Œºg/bee), or thiamethoxam (1 and 0.1 ng/bee), behavioral functions of honeybees were tested on day 12. Fipronil, used at the dose of 0.1 ng/bee, induced mortality of all honeybees after one week of treatment. As a result of contact treatment at 0.01 ng/bee, honeybees spent significantly more time immobile in an open-field apparatus and ingested significantly more water. In the olfactory conditioning paradigm, fipronil-treated honeybees failed to discriminate between a known and an unknown odorant. Thiamethoxam by contact induced either a significant decrease of olfactory memory 24 h after learning at 0.1 ng/bee or a significant impairment of learning performance with no effect on memory at 1 ng/bee. Responsiveness to antennal sucrose stimulation was significantly decreased for high sucrose concentrations in honeybees treated orally with thiamethoxam (1 ng/bee). The only significant effect of acetamiprid (administered orally, 0.1 Œºg/bee) was an increase in responsiveness to water. The neonicotinoids acetamiprid and thiamethoxam tested at the highest dose (one-tenth and one-fifth of their oral LD50, respectively) and fipronil at one-five-hundredth of LD50 have limited effects on the motor, sensory, and cognitive functions of the honeybee.

Therefore, special attention was given to reducing unintentional intoxications under field conditions. The sensitivity of winter bees throughout their long lifespan to residual exposure of pesticides is not well known, since most previous studies only looked at the effects on summer bees. Here, we performed various laboratory bioassays to assess the effects of clothianidin on the survival and behavior of winter bees. Oral lethal and sublethal doses were administered throughout 12-day. The obtained LD50 values at 48, 72, 96¬†h and 10¬†days were 26.9, 18.0, 15.1 and 9.5¬†ng/bee, respectively. Concentrations <20¬†¬µg/kg were found to be sublethal. Oral exposure to sublethal doses was carried out for 12-day and, the behavioral functions were tested on the respective 13th day. Although slight reductions in the responses at the concentrations 10 and 15¬†¬µg/kg were observed, all tested sublethal concentrations had showed non-significant effects on the sucrose responsiveness, habitation of the proboscis extension reflex and olfactory learning performance. Nevertheless, chronic exposure to 15¬†¬µg/kg affected the specificity of the early long-term memory (24¬†h). Since the tested concentrations were in the range of field-relevant concentrations, our results strongly suggest that related-effects on winter and summer bees‚Äô sensitivity should also be studied under realistic conditions. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2016///,2016,10.1007/s10646-016-1657-3,25,5,1000,1010,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964389403&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-016-1657-3&partnerID=40&md5=9621d17fc9355b904e69be709398623c,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,331
303,JOUR,Exposure to neonicotinoids influences the motor function of adult worker honeybees,"['Williamson, S.M.', 'Willis, S.J.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Ecotoxicology,"Systemic pesticides such as neonicotinoids are commonly used on flowering crops visited by pollinators, and their use has been implicated in the decline of insect pollinator populations in Europe and North America. Several studies show that neonicotinoids affect navigation and learning in bees but few studies have examined whether these substances influence their basic motor function. Here, we investigated how prolonged exposure to sublethal doses of four neonicotinoid pesticides (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, dinotefuran) and the plant toxin, nicotine, affect basic motor function and postural control in foraging-age worker honeybees. We used doses of 10¬†nM for each neonicotinoid: field-relevant doses that we determined to be sublethal and willingly consumed by bees. The neonicotinoids were placed in food solutions given to bees for 24¬†h. After the exposure period, bees were more likely to lose postural control during the motor function assay and fail to right themselves if exposed to imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin. Bees exposed to thiamethoxam and nicotine also spent more time grooming. Other behaviours (walking, sitting and flying) were not significantly affected. Expression of changes in motor function after exposure to imidacloprid was dose-dependent and affected all measured behaviours. Our data illustrate that 24¬†h exposure to sublethal doses of neonicotinoid pesticides has a subtle influence on bee behaviour that is likely to affect normal function in a field setting. ¬© 2014, The Author(s).",2014///,2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1283-x,23,8,1409,1418,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84912037552&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-014-1283-x&partnerID=40&md5=973a4e18f3653de97b0a0ae5d675f049,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,332

RESULTS: Bees exposed to imidacloprid displayed a significant dose-dependent reduction in consumption at 10 and 100 Œºg L-1, which was reversed when untreated feed was offered. No consistent avoidance/antifeedant response to nectar substitute with thiamethoxam was detected at the more field-realistic dose rates of 1 and 10 Œºg L-1, and exposure to the very high 100 Œºg L-1 dose rate was followed by 100% mortality of experimental insects. No reduction in food intake was recorded at 1 Œºg clothianidin L-1, reduced consumption was noted at 10 Œºg clothianidin L-1 and 100% mortality occurred when bees were exposed to rates of 100 Œºg clothianidin L-1.

Studies have yielded contradictory results, and few have examined effects on colony development. Here we report the results of a comprehensive five-year study of the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on honey bee colonies. Colonies fed 5 ng/g (ppb) imidacloprid in sugar syrup showed increased brood production, lower temperature variability, higher CO2 production and had more foragers compared to control colonies fed unadulterated syrup, but treatment did not affect adult bee numbers or average hive temperatures, and did not increase food stores, daily food acquisition or colony survivorship. These results suggest that imidacloprid contamination increased colony metabolism without improving colony productivity, and helps explain why some studies have reported no, or even positive, effects of neonicotinoids. Effect sizes were generally small but that could be attributed at least in part to variability in uncontrolled factors such as weather.

We analyze the combined effects of climate warming and sublethal insecticide exposure in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta. Previous Osmia studies show that warm wintering temperatures cause body weight loss, lipid consumption, and fat body depletion. Because the fat body plays a key role in xenobiotic detoxification, we expected that bees exposed to climate warming scenarios would be more sensitive to pesticides. We exposed O. cornuta females to three wintering treatments: current scenario (2007‚Äì2012 temperatures), near-future (2021‚Äì2050 projected temperatures), and distant-future (2051‚Äì2080). Upon emergence in spring, bees were orally exposed to three sublethal doses of an insecticide (Closer, a.i. sulfoxaflor; 0, 4.55 and 11.64 ng a.i./bee). We measured the combined effects of wintering and insecticide exposure on phototactic response, syrup consumption, and longevity. Wintering treatment by itself did not affect winter mortality, but body weight loss increased with increasing wintering temperatures. Similarly, wintering treatment by itself hardly influenced phototactic response or syrup consumption. However, bees wintered at the warmest temperatures had shorter longevity, a strong fecundity predictor in Osmia. Insecticide exposure, especially at the high dose, impaired the ability of bees to respond to light, and resulted in reduced syrup consumption and longevity. The combination of the warmest winter and the high insecticide dose resulted in a 70% longevity decrease. Smaller bees, resulting from smaller pollen‚Äìnectar provisions, had shorter longevity suggesting nutritional stress may further compromise fecundity in O. cornuta. Our results show a synergistic interaction between two major drivers of bee declines, and indicate that bees will become more sensitive to pesticides under the current global warming scenario. Our findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and underscore the need to consider multiple stressors to understand bee declines. ¬© 2023 The Authors.

However, there have been few in-hive studies on sulfoximines, and the effects on honey bee colony growth and foraging activity are unknown. Here, we calculated the LC50 of Closer¬Æ 24% suspension concentrate (SC) using honey bee foragers then assessed the impacts of chronic exposure of honey bees to a lesser concentration of Closer¬Æ in a semi-field in-hive experiment. To do that, we used a worst-case exposure scenario and fed bees for 21 days with a sublethal and field-relevant concentration of sulfoxaflor (0.3 ppb) which represents the calculated LC5 value of Closer¬Æ.

This study assessed the susceptibility levels of T. angustula to four neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam), widely used to manage pests on different crops, and their effects on locomotion of the bee. Neonicotinoids with the cyano radical caused lower bee mortality (assessed by mean lethal concentration, LC50), while those compounds with the nitro radical were highly harmful to T. angustula. Locomotion activity was strongly impaired in bees treated with thiacloprid and imidacloprid, while acetamiprid did not affect the locomotion activity, which was similar to the control. Application of thiamethoxam caused hyperactivity, as observed by increases of ‚àº4.5 and 5.0-fold in mean speed and distance traveled, respectively. These results suggest that applications of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect the pollination activity of T. angustula.

145,JOUR,The development of the solitary bee Osmia bicornis is affected by some insecticide agrochemicals at environmentally relevant concentrations,"['Mokkapati, J.S.', 'Bednarska, A.J.', 'Laskowski, R.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Solitary bees provide essential pollination services for many arable crops, but are prone to global decline. Agricultural intensification, which is connected with pesticide usage, is among major threats to bees and, thus, to the food security and ecosystem stability. As it may not be possible to cease pesticide usage currently because of the growing demand for food, it is crucial to understand the pesticide toxicities to bees for better protection of pollinator populations. The majority of studies have focused on social bees, and those on solitary bees studied effects of adult exposure, whereas these bees are also likely to be exposed as larvae via the consumption of contaminated pollen. Here, the effects of three commonly used insecticide-based plant protection products on the development of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis (red mason bee), were studied by exposing larvae to insecticide-contaminated multifloral pollen. The tested insecticides were: Dursban480EC, containing the organophosphate chlorpyrifos (CHP), Sherpa100EC, containing the pyrethroid cypermethrin (CYP), and Mospilan20SP with the neonicotinoid acetamiprid (ACT). When compared to the control larvae fed with uncontaminated-pollen, both CHP and CYP significantly reduced the O. bicornis larval survival and their body mass at all tested concentrations. In contrast, ACT did not affect either larval survival or body mass, but the length of larval stage to cocoon formation was significantly shortened compared to controls. None of studied insecticides affected the mass of cocooned individuals. However, at least 80% of individuals exposed to any of the tested insecticides died before reaching the adult stage, whereas 43% of the controls emerged successfully after overwintering. Although no clear monotonic dose-response relationships were found, our study showed that at least some insecticide formulations affect the development of O. bicornis even at concentrations actually found in pollen in the field, indicating an urgent need for revising current pesticide usage recommendations. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145588,775,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100902427&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.145588&partnerID=40&md5=ada10602eb674fe7d7622c23dbe9b6e0,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'adult', 'agricultural chemical', 'Agricultural chemicals', 'Agricultural intensification', 'Agricultural robots', 'Agriculture', 'agrochemical', 'Agrochemicals', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'animal model', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee disease', 'Bees', 'body mass', 'Chemical contamination', 'chlorpyrifos', 'cocoon', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'cypermethrin', 'death', 'Ecological risk assessment', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystem stability', 'Ecosystems', 'Ecotoxicology', 'female', 'Food security', 'Food supply', 'Growing demand', 'insect larva', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larval development', 'larval stage', 'Larval survival', 'male', 'Monotonic dose', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia rufa', 'overwintering', 'pesticide', 'Pesticide', 'Plant protection products', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Red mason bee', 'risk assessment', 'survival', 'Toxicity']",,,,0,,0,339
63,JOUR,Surrogate species in pesticide risk assessments: Toxicological data of three stingless bees species,"['Lourencetti, A.P.S.', 'Azevedo, P.', 'Miotelo, L.', 'Malaspina, O.', 'Nocelli, R.C.F.']",Environmental Pollution,"Discussions about environmental risk reassessment of pesticides have grown in the last decades, especially in tropical and subtropical regions since the diversity of bee species in these places is quite different. Stingless bees are highly affected by pesticides, and toxicity information is necessary to include them in the regulatory process of countries that hosts a diversity of these species. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the Median Lethal Concentration (LC50), estimate the Median Lethal Dose (LD50) and compared the sensitivity of three species of stingless bees exposed to the commercial formulation of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (TMX). The LD50 was estimated based on the LC50 determined in the present study (LC50 = 0.329 ng a.i./ŒºL for Tetragonisca angustula; 0.624 ng a.i./ŒºL for Scaptotrigona postica, and 0.215 ng a.i./ŒºL for Melipona scutellaris). Considering these data, toxicity endpoints were used to fit species sensitive distribution curves (SSD) and determine the sensitivity ratio. The results showed that all the stingless bees tested are more sensitive to TMX than the Apis mellifera, the model organism used in ecotoxicological tests. Regarding the oral LC50, the most susceptible and most tolerant species were M. scutellaris > T. angustula > S. postica > A. mellifera. Following the same evaluated pattern, for the LD50 (considering the weight of the bees - ng a.i./g bee), we have: M. scutellaris > S. postica > T. angustula > A. mellifera, and without the weight considered (ng a.i./bee): T. angustula > M. scutellaris > S. postica > A. mellifera. The different sensitivities among stingless bee species highlight the importance of inserting more than one surrogate species with a variety of sizes in research and protocol development. Additionally, the research suggests the need to investigate patterns regarding the influence of body mass on pesticide sensitivity among stingless bee species. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120842,318,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85144079658&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2022.120842&partnerID=40&md5=76784e21ad6b201448cabf3e1b119948,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'thiamethoxam', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'stingless bee', 'Thiamethoxam', 'Toxicity', 'toxicology', 'body mass', 'body weight', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'LC50', 'sensitivity analysis', 'Scaptotrigona postica', 'species difference', 'Tropics', 'Body weight', 'Melipona scutellaris', 'Tetragonisca angustula', 'Environmental risks', 'species sensitivity distribution', 'Tropical regions', 'Population distribution', 'sensitivity ratio', 'species', 'Species sensitivity distribution', 'Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD)', 'Species sensitivity distributions', 'surrogate species']",,,,0,,0,340

We studied the effects of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on olfactory learning in the native honey bee species, Apis cerana, an important pollinator of agricultural and native plants throughout Asia. We provide the first evidence that imidacloprid can impair learning in A. cerana workers exposed as adults or as larvae. Adults that ingested a single imidacloprid dose as low as 0.1ng/bee had significantly reduced olfactory learning acquisition, which was 1.6-fold higher in control bees. Longer-term learning (1-17h after the last learning trial) was also impaired. Bees exposed as larvae to a total dose of 0.24ng/bee did not have reduced survival to adulthood. However, these larval-treated bees had significantly impaired olfactory learning when tested as adults: control bees exhibited up to 4.8-fold better short-term learning acquisition, though longer-term learning was not affected.

140,JOUR,RFID tracking of sublethal effects of two neonicotinoid insecticides on the foraging behavior of Apis mellifera,"['Schneider, C.W.', 'Tautz, J.', 'Gr√ºnewald, B.', 'Fuchs, S.']",PLoS ONE,"The development of insecticides requires valid risk assessment procedures to avoid causing harm to beneficial insects and especially to pollinators such as the honeybee Apis mellifera. In addition to testing according to current guidelines designed to detect bee mortality, tests are needed to determine possible sublethal effects interfering with the animal's vitality and behavioral performance. Several methods have been used to detect sublethal effects of different insecticides under laboratory conditions using olfactory conditioning. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on the influence insecticides have on foraging activity and homing ability which require time-consuming visual observation. We tested an experimental design using the radiofrequency identification (RFID) method to monitor the influence of sublethal doses of insecticides on individual honeybee foragers on an automated basis. With electronic readers positioned at the hive entrance and at an artificial food source, we obtained quantifiable data on honeybee foraging behavior. This enabled us to efficiently retrieve detailed information on flight parameters. We compared several groups of bees, fed simultaneously with different dosages of a tested substance. With this experimental approach we monitored the acute effects of sublethal doses of the neonicotinoids imidacloprid (0.15-6 ng/bee) and clothianidin (0.05-2 ng/bee) under field-like circumstances. At field-relevant doses for nectar and pollen no adverse effects were observed for either substance. Both substances led to a significant reduction of foraging activity and to longer foraging flights at doses of ‚â•0.5 ng/bee (clothianidin) and ‚â•1.5 ng/bee (imidacloprid) during the first three hours after treatment. This study demonstrates that the RFID-method is an effective way to record short-term alterations in foraging activity after insecticides have been administered once, orally, to individual bees. We contribute further information on the understanding of how honeybees are affected by sublethal doses of insecticides. ¬© 2012 Schneider et al.",2012///,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0030023,7,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84855704065&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0030023&partnerID=40&md5=976863335c5907ddb11a286697266103,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,342

RIC-3 (resistant to inhibitors of cholinesterase 3) has been shown to diversify by its differential mRNA splicing patterns. How such diversity influences neonicotinoid sensitivity of nAChRs of beneficial insect species remains poorly understood. We have identified a RIC-3 variant expressed most abundantly in the thoracic ganglia of honeybee (Apis mellifera) workers and investigated its effects on the functional expression and pharmacology of AmŒ±1/AmŒ±8/AmŒ≤1 and AmŒ±1/AmŒ±2/AmŒ±8/AmŒ≤1 nAChRs expressed in X. laevis oocytes.

Co-expression of the AmRIC-3 had a minimal impact on the affinity of ACh, but changed the efficacy of imidacloprid and clothianidin, suggesting that the presence and the level of RIC-3 expression can affect the nAChR responses to ACh and neonicotinoids, depending on nAChR subunit composition in honeybees. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",2024///,2024,10.1002/ps.8371,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201672263&doi=10.1002%2fps.8371&partnerID=40&md5=3bf669895fd7ddd4fee4f5719f84a087,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'auxiliary protein', 'neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic acetylcholine receptors', 'RIC-3']",,0,,0,343
185,JOUR,Effects of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam at field-realistic levels on microcolonies of Bombus terrestris worker bumble bees,"['Laycock, I.', 'Cotterell, K.C.', ""O'Shea-Wheller, T.A."", 'Cresswell, J.E.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently implicated in the decline of wild bee populations. Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris L. workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98Œºgkg-1 in dietary syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer days when presented with syrup dosed at 98Œºg thiamethoxamkg-1, while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only at the two highest concentrations (39, 98Œºgkg-1). In contrast, we found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11Œºgkg-1). By comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on production of brood. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.",2014///,2014,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2013.10.027,100,1,153,158,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892602774&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2013.10.027&partnerID=40&md5=ec4e0e2e11fd0cfd95e2ea6500fb0294,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,344

Our understanding of the risk of imidacloprid to larvae of the honeybees is still in a very early stage. In this study, the capped-brood, pupation and eclosion rates of the honeybee larvae were recorded after treating them directly in the hive with different dosages of imidacloprid. The brood-capped rates of the larvae decreased significantly when the dosages increased from 24 to 8000 ng/larva. However, there were no significant effects of DMSO or 0.4 ng of imidacloprid per larva on the brood-capped, pupation and eclosion rates. Although the sublethal dosage of imidacloprid had no effect on the eclosion rate, we found that the olfactory associative behavior of the adult bees was impaired if they had been treated with 0.04 ng/larva imidacloprid in the larval stage. These results demonstrate that a sublethal dosage of imidacloprid given to the larvae affects the subsequent associative ability of the adult honeybee workers.

402,JOUR,Various routes of formulated insecticide mixture whole-body acute contact toxicity to honey bees (Apis mellifera),"['Belsky, J.', 'Biddinger, D.J.', 'Seiter, N.', 'Joshi, N.K.']",Environmental Challenges,"Honey bees, Apis mellifera (Linnaeus) are crucial pollinators, however large overwinter losses of managed hives and declines in feral colonies have occurred since 2006. Increased insecticide use and the introduction of new insecticide classes have been proposed as factors contributing to these declines. Previous studies have demonstrated contact toxicity of single active ingredient insecticides to honey bees. However, the field realistic contact toxicity of formulated (pre-mix) insecticide mixtures containing multiple active ingredients (each with a different mode of action) to honey bees has not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we simulate whole body contact to spray applications made at low label recommended field rates of thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin, imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin, chlorantraniliprole + lambda-cyhalothrin and methoxyfenozide + spinetoram to honey bees under three realistic scenarios in field crops: (1) continuous exposure, (2) spray-only exposure, and (3) residual exposure. A customized spray tower in a laboratory setting was used to apply insecticides at the lowest recommended dose in the Environmental Protection Agency regulated label of each insecticide. Acute toxicity was determined by screening resulting mortality up to 96-hours post treatment. Mortality varied significantly between treatments at all evaluation periods for all experiments except residual exposure. For continuous and spray-only exposure, thiamethoxam + lambda-cyhalothrin and imidacloprid + beta-cyfluthrin resulted in 80‚Äì90% mortality at 48-hours, while at 96-hours we observed close to complete mortality for all treatments. This difference in mortality onset between treatments highlights the importance of extended observation beyond the 48-hours recommended by the USDA-EPA. Our finding of overall high mortality demonstrates the importance of comparing both combined and individual active ingredients in determining insecticide risk to honey bees. ¬© 2021 The Author(s)",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envc.2021.100408,6,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121971627&doi=10.1016%2fj.envc.2021.100408&partnerID=40&md5=307e0fa6bd4fd2981a4bd75f8f1aa83c,Scopus,"['Neonicotinoids', 'Honey bees', 'Toxicity', 'Pyrethroids', 'Premix insecticides', 'Residual toxicity']",,,,0,,0,346

However, information concerning neonicotinoid effects on honey bee thermoregulation is lacking. Thermoregulation is an essential ability for the honey bee that guarantees the success of foraging and many in-hive tasks, especially brood rearing. We tested the effects of acute exposure to thiamethoxam (0.2, 1, 2¬†ng/bee) on the thorax temperatures of foragers exposed to low (22¬†¬∞C) and high (33¬†¬∞C) temperature environments. Thiamethoxam significantly altered honey bee thorax temperature at all doses tested; the effects elicited varied depending on the environmental temperature and pesticide dose to which individuals were exposed. When bees were exposed to the high temperature environment, the high dose of thiamethoxam increased their thorax temperature 1‚Äì2¬†h after exposure. When bees were exposed to the low temperature, the higher doses of the neonicotinoid reduced bee thorax temperatures 60‚Äì90¬†min after treatment. In both experiments, the neonicotinoid decreased the temperature of bees the day following the exposure. After a cold shock (5¬†min at 4¬†¬∞C), the two higher doses elicited a decrease of the thorax temperature, while the lower dose caused an increase, compared to the control. These alterations in thermoregulation caused by thiamethoxam may affect bee foraging activity and a variety of in-hive tasks, likely leading to negative consequences at the colony level.

Understanding the simultaneous impact of stressors, particularly interactions between them, is critical to effectively conserving bees. Although behavioral effects of pesticides like neonicotinoids have received some attention in solitary bees, our understanding of how they are modulated by diet quality is limited. Furthermore, scarce data exist on what concentrations of orally ingested neonicotinoids elicit mortality in solitary bees. In a controlled exposure laboratory experiment, we investigated how diet quality, as sugar concentration, and chronic oral exposure to imidacloprid affect adult alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius). We provided individuals ad libitum with either 20 or 50% (m/m) sucrose syrups containing either 0, 30, or 300 ppb imidacloprid (measuring 0, 27, and 209 ppb via an ELISA assay). Over 5 wk, we tracked behavior and survivorship of individuals. Imidacloprid decreased survivorship in a dose-dependent fashion, but sucrose content did not affect survivorship, even in bees not fed imidacloprid. In the high imidacloprid treatment, 45% of bees were observed in a motionless supine position while still alive, with this effect appearing to be buffered against by the higher sucrose diet. Our results suggest that diets higher in sugar concentration may prevent an intermediate stage of poisoning, but do not ultimately extend longevity. In devising risk assessments for bees, it is important to consider that interactions between stressors may occur in the stages leading up to death even if survivorship is unaffected. ¬© 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

For the most part, exposure to these pesticide mixtures does not result in acute lethal effects, but we know very little about potential sublethal effects and their consequences on reproductive success and population dynamics. In this study, we orally exposed newly emerged females of the solitary bee Osmia cornuta to environmentally-relevant levels of acetamiprid (a cyano-substituted neonicotinoid insecticide) singly and in combination with tebuconazole (a sterol-biosynthesis inhibitor (SBI) fungicide). The amount of feeding solution consumed during the exposure phase was lowest in bees exposed to the pesticide mixture. Following exposure, females were individually marked and released into oilseed rape field cages to monitor their nesting performance and assess their reproductive success. The nesting performance and reproductive success of bees exposed to the fungicide or the insecticide alone were similar to those of control bees and resulted in a 1.3‚Äì1.7 net population increases. By contrast, bees exposed to the pesticide mixture showed lower establishment, shortened nesting period, and reduced fecundity. Together, these effects led to a 0.5‚Äì0.6 population decrease. Female establishment and shortened nesting period were the main population bottlenecks. We found no effects of the pesticide mixture on nest provisioning rate, offspring body weight or sex ratio. Our study shows how sublethal pesticide exposure may affect several components of bee reproductive success and, ultimately, population growth. Our results calls for a rethinking of pollinator risk assessment schemes, which should target not only single compounds but also combinations of compounds likely to co-occur in agricultural environments. ¬© 2024 The Author(s)",2024///,2024,10.1016/j.envint.2024.108919,190,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85200120599&doi=10.1016%2fj.envint.2024.108919&partnerID=40&md5=eac4692c5c6ca910d7d33e4a357554dd,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollinator', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'drug effect', 'physiology', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Sublethal effects', 'Lethal effects', 'Performance', 'reproduction', 'mortality', 'male', 'Reproduction', 'body weight', 'fungicide', 'Agriculture', 'Female', 'nesting', 'Exposed to', 'Fungicides', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'Pesticide mixture', 'population dynamics', 'reproductive success', 'triazole derivative', 'Triazoles', 'Biochemistry', 'Population statistics', 'growth rate', 'Agricultural environments', 'tebuconazole', 'population growth', 'Population Growth', 'cocoon', 'Solitary bees', 'Solitary bee', 'sterol', 'Reproductive success', 'biosynthesis', 'Population dynamics', 'Population growth rates', 'rape', 'Realistic level', 'Realistic levels', 'reproductive health']",,,,0,,0,351
283,JOUR,The neonicotinoid clothianidin impairs memory processing in honey bees,"['Tison, L.', 'R√∂√üner, A.', 'Gerschewski, S.', 'Menzel, R.']",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"Neonicotinoids act as agonists on the nicotinic Acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)in insect brains, an essential molecular component of central brain structures involved in learning and memory formation. Sublethal doses might, therefore, impair neural processes necessary for adaptive experience dependent behaviour and thus reduce the fitness of pollinating insects on the individual and community level. First, the question was addressed whether clothianidin has an aversive taste for honey bees and concluded with both a laboratory and a semi-field experiment that bees are unable to distinguish between control and contaminated sucrose solutions. In the laboratory, proboscis extension response conditioning was performed with forager bees exposed to different concentrations of clothianidin (0.1, 0.3 and 0.8 ng/bee)before learning, after learning during memory consolidation, and just before memory retention. These tests at different timings allowed uncovering an impairment of the consolidation and retrieval of memory due to the exposure to clothianidin. It was concluded that an acute exposure to clothianidin has an adverse effect on memory processing in honey bees. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2019///,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.05.007,180,,139,145,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065440636&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2019.05.007&partnerID=40&md5=ac12e9fc192623db689b1baeded4658c,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,352
245,JOUR,Characteristics of imidacloprid toxicity in two Apis mellifera subspecies,"['Suchail, S.', 'Guez, D.', 'Belzunces, L.P.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Imidacloprid (1-(6-chloro-3-pyridylmethyl)-N-nitroimidazolidin-2- ylideneamine) belongs to a new chemical family of chloronicotinyl compounds whose mode of action on the insect nervous system differs from that of traditional neurotoxic products. Imidacloprid, a strong systemic compound, is effective against several sucking and mining pests. The acute toxicity of contact and oral applications on two Apis mellifera subspecies, Apis mellifera mellifera and Apis mellifera caucasica, was investigated. In all toxicological studies, each dose included three cages of 20 individuals and each study was replicated three times. The dose-mortality relation revealed some unusual characteristics. At low imidacloprid concentrations, a biphasic mortality appeared, particularly with the contact exposure route. At moderate doses, mortality profiles at 24 and 48 h were different only after oral application. Response kinetics showed that mortality was delayed at the higher doses of imidacloprid. After oral intoxication, the LD50 values of imidacloprid at 24 and 48 h were about 5 ng/bee for both A. m. mellifera and A. m. caucasica. After contact application, the LD50 values at 24 and 48 h were approximately 24 ng/bee for A. m. mellifera and 14 ng/bee for A. m. caucasica.

However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb & 10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case, assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in laboratory conditions.",2017/08/14/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-08752-x,7,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000407559100005,,0,,0,355

However, it remains unclear as to which life-history stage is critically affected by exposure. One hypothesis is that sulfoxaflor exposure early in the colony's life cycle can impair larval development, reducing the number of workers produced and ultimately lowering colony reproductive output. Here we assess the influence of sulfoxaflor exposure on bumblebee larval mortality and growth both when tested in insolation and when in combination with the common fungal parasiteNosema bombi,following a pre-registered design. We found no significant impact of sulfoxaflor (5 ppb) orN. bombiexposure (50 000 spores) on larval mortality when tested in isolation but found an additive, negative effect when larvae received both stressors in combination. Individually, sulfoxaflor andN. bombiexposure each impaired larval growth, although the impact of combined exposure fell significantly short of the predicted sum of the individual effects (i.e. they interacted antagonistically). Ultimately, our results suggest that colony-level consequences of sulfoxaflor exposure for bumblebees may be mediated through direct effects on larvae.

(Hymenoptera: Apidae). In this context, the use of insecticides with lower residuals and less harmful effects to bees is fundamental. Thus, the objective of the current work was to evaluate, in a laboratory bioassay, the residual toxicity and effect of imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and a mixture of both, when applied on canola in the field, on Africanized A. mellifera workers. Three commercial products were applied, formulated with imidacloprid, beta-cyfluthrin, and beta-cyfluthrin + imidacloprid. Each plot received one of the three treatments, in the concentration recommended by the manufacturer, at intervals between 14 and 0¬†days prior to conducting the bioassays. On the day of the bioassay, the bees were exposed to the plant material containing the treatments for a period of two hours, and were transferred to PVC cages, containing food and water. Mortality assessments were then performed at pre-established intervals until a 96¬†h post-exposure. Residuals on canola leaves of all tested products caused a significant reduction of honeybee worker longevity, which was less accentuated when the interval after treatment application increased.

Honeybees were treated orally with 100 Œºg of 14C-imidacloprid per kg of bee, a dose close to the median lethal dose. Elimination half-life of total radioactivity in honeybee was 25 h. Haemolymph was the compartment with the lowest and rectum that with the highest level of total radioactivity during the whole study, with a maximum 24 h after treatment. Elimination half-life of imidacloprid in whole honeybee was 5 h. Imidacloprid was readily distributed and metabolised only by Phase I enzymes into five metabolites: 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, 4,5-dihydroxy- imidacloprid, 6-chloronicotinic acid, and olefin and urea derivatives. The guanidine derivative was not detected. The urea derivative and 6-chloronicotinic acid were the main metabolites and appeared particularly in midgut and rectum. The olefin derivative and 4/5-hydroxy-imidacloprid preferentially occurred in head, thorax and abdomen, which are nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-rich tissues.

The ubiquity of bee pollinators in agricultural landscapes frequently results in their exposure to agrochemicals, which has been associated with their decline. Stingless bees are wild pollinators restricted to the Pantropical region, and like honey bees, are suffering colony losses. However, stingless bees and honey bees do not show the same behaviors, therefore, methods used for risk assessment of honey bees cannot be utilized on stingless bees. Herein, we describe protocols to standardize methods that allow for the exploration of lethal and sublethal effects of agrochemicals via acute and chronic exposure of stingless bees. The in vitro rearing used for chronic exposure from the egg to the adult stage proved to be effective in obtaining relevant screenings. In addition, we performed a meta‚Äêanalysis and summarized the results of toxicological studies conducted with the protocols described. The meta-analyses indicated a reduction in survival under acute and chronic exposures to agrochemicals, and revealed that our protocols for toxicological assessments did not have publication bias for either acute or chronic exposure.

103,JOUR,Spinosad toxicity to pollinators and associated risk,"['Mayes, M.A.', 'Thompson, G.D.', 'Husband, B.', 'Miles, M.M.']",Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Spinosad is a natural insecticide derived from an actinomycete bacterium species, Saccharopolyspora spinosa (Mertz and Yao 1990), that displays the efficacy of a synthetic insecticide. It consists of the two most active metabolites, designated spinosyn A and D. Both spinosyns are readily degraded in moist aerobic soil, and field dissipation, which is quite rapid (half-life, 0.3-0.5 d) can be attributed to photolysis or a combination of metabolism and photolysis. Spinosad causes neurological effects in insects that are consistent with the general activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but by a mechanism that is novel among known insecticide compounds. Spinosad has a high level of efficacy for lepidopteran larvae, as well as some Diptera, Coleoptera, Thysanoptera, and Hymenoptera, but has limited to no activity to other insects and exhibits low toxicity to mammals and other wildlife. Although Spinosad has low toxicity to most beneficial insects, initial acute laboratory tests indicated that Spinosad is intrinsically toxic to pollinators. The hazard of Spinosad to bees was evaluated using a tiered approach. Initial acute laboratory exposures were conducted, followed by toxicity of residues of spinosad on treated foliage, greenhouse studies to assess acute as well as chronic toxicity, confined field assessments, and finally full field studies using a variety of crops under typical use conditions. These data were used to assess the potential of adverse effects on foraging bees following the use of spinosad. This research has clearly demonstrated that spinosad residues that have been allowed to dry for 3 hr are not acutely harmful to honeybees when low-volume and ultralow-volume sprays are used. Further, glasshouse and semifield studies have demonstrated that dried residues are not acutely toxic, and although pollen and nectar from sprayed plants may have transient effects on brood development, the residues do not overtly affect hive viability of either the honeybee or the bumblebee. Field studies in which typical application methods of spinosad were used on a variety of crops have demonstrated that spinosad has low risk to adult honeybees and has little or no effect on hive activity and brood development. The collective evidence from these studies indicates that once spinosad residues have dried on plant foliage, generally 3 hr or less, the risk of spinosad to honeybees is negligible. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2003.",2003///,2003,10.1007/0-387-21731-2_2,179,,37,71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0242371130&doi=10.1007%2f0-387-21731-2_2&partnerID=40&md5=db500ad2fa15244e47bc391f46f4601a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,361
399,JOUR,Interaction between Varroa destructor and imidacloprid reduces flight capacity of honeybees,"['Blanken, L.J.', 'van Langevelde, F.', 'van Dooremalen, C.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Current high losses of honeybees seriously threaten crop pollination. Whereas parasite exposure is acknowledged as an important cause of these losses, the role of insecticides is controversial. Parasites and neonicotinoid insecticides reduce homing success of foragers (e.g. by reduced orientation), but it is unknown whether they negatively affect flight capacity. We investigated how exposing colonies to the parasitic mite Varroa destructor and the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid affect flight capacity of foragers. Flight distance, time and speed of foragers were measured in flight mills to assess the relative and interactive effects of high V. destructor load and a field-realistic, chronic sub-lethal dose of imidacloprid. Foragers from colonies exposed to high levels of V. destructor flew shorter distances, with a larger effect when also exposed to imidacloprid. Bee body mass partly explained our results as bees were heavier when exposed to these stressors, possibly due to an earlier onset of foraging. Our findings contribute to understanding of interacting stressors that can explain colony losses. Reduced flight capacity decreases the food-collecting ability of honeybees and may hamper the use of precocious foraging as a coping mechanism during colony (nutritional) stress. Ineffective coping mechanisms may lead to destructive cascading effects and subsequent colony collapse. ¬© 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We provide the first demonstration that sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid can harm honey bee decision-making about danger by significantly increasing the probability of a bee visiting a dangerous food source. Apis cerana is a native bee that is an important pollinator of agricultural crops and native plants in Asia. When foraging on nectar containing 40 Œºg/L (34 ppb) imidacloprid, honey bees (Apis cerana) showed no aversion to a feeder with a hornet predator, and 1.8 fold more bees chose the dangerous feeder as compared to control bees. Control bees exhibited significant predator avoidance. We also give the first evidence that foraging by A. cerana workers can be inhibited by sublethal concentrations of the pesticide, imidacloprid, which is widely used in Asia. Compared to bees collecting uncontaminated nectar, 23% fewer foragers returned to collect the nectar with 40 Œºg/L imidacloprid. Bees that did return respectively collected 46% and 63% less nectar containing 20 Œºg/L and 40 Œºg/L imidacloprid. These results suggest that the effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee decision-making and other advanced cognitive functions should be explored.

However, environmental neurotoxic insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the larval food of queens from Plebeia droryana, a species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers. Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression) from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.09.048,166,,42,47,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053782196&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.09.048&partnerID=40&md5=dc45b81a935968ce1562a21945e04ef6,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,364
128,JOUR,Thiamethoxam honey bee colony feeding study: Linking effects at the level of the individual to those at the colony level,"['Overmyer, J.', 'Feken, M.', 'Ruddle, N.', 'Bocksch, S.', 'Hill, M.', 'Thompson, H.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Neonicotinoid insecticides have been used globally on a wide range of crops through seed treatment as well as soil and foliar applications and have been increasingly studied in relation to the potential risk to bees because of their detection in pollen and nectar of bee-attractive crops. The present article reports the results of laboratory studies (10-d adult and 22-d larval toxicity studies assessing the chronic toxicity of thiamethoxam to adult honey bees and larvae, respectively) and a colony feeding study, with 6 wk of exposure in an area with limited alternative forage, to provide a prewintering colony-level endpoint. The endpoints following exposure of individuals in the laboratory (10-d adult chronic no-observed-effect concentration [NOEC] for mortality 117 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution, 141 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution; 22-d larval chronic NOEC 102 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg diet) are compared with those generated at the colony level, which incorporates sublethal effects (no-observed-adverse-effect concentration [NOAEC] 50 Œºg thiamethoxam/L sucrose solution, 43 Œºg thiamethoxam/kg sucrose solution). The data for sucrose-fed honey bee colonies support the lack of effects identified in previous colony-level field studies with thiamethoxam. However, unlike these field studies demonstrating no effects, colony feeding study data also provide a threshold level of exposure likely to result in adverse effects on the colony in the absence of alternative forage, and a basis by which to evaluate the potential risk of thiamethoxam residues detected in pollen, nectar, or water following treatment of bee-attractive crops.

333,JOUR,Insecticide and low food quality treatments reduce health and pollination services of two key pollinator taxa,"['Birkenbach, M', 'Straub, F', 'Weiherm√ºller, P', 'Wilfert, L', 'Ayasse, M', 'Kuppler, J']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pesticides and the lack of floral resources are key drivers of insect decline in agricultural areas. Both land-use stressors can have a variety of synergistic and sublethal effects on pollinators, affecting their health and foraging behaviour. Pollinating insects include species with vastly different life histories, giving them potentially different vulnerability and resilience to stressors. However, most research has generally focused on bees. Here, we contrast synergistic effects of nutritional stress and pesticide use on social bumblebees and solitary hoverflies. We experimentally tested the effects of the neonicotinoid acetamiprid and low-quality food on health traits of Bombus terrestris workers and Episyrphus balteatus adults (ovarian development, body size and colony development or survival). The foraging behaviour of treated pollinators was recorded in a semi-field setup and, for B. terrestris, we measured the pollen amount on the body surface and the pollen deposited on stigmata after a single floral visit. Both stressors affected bumblebee health. Additionally, insecticide-treated workers showed increased flower handling times and flight durations, while low-quality food reduced the amount of pollen on the surface of bumblebees and the pollen deposited on stigmata. Syrphids were mostly affected by low-quality food, which decreased their survival probability and changed their foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we found an interactive effect between the two stressors, reducing E. balteatus ovary development. Synthesis and applications. Insecticide and food stress affected fitness traits of both bumblebees and syrphid flies, possibly reducing pollinator populations under natural conditions. Especially for bumblebees, long-term exposure led to a reduction in the provision of pollination services, both by changing their behaviour and reducing pollen transfer. We found differences between the two pollinator groups, showing that results gained from single groups like bees should not be extrapolated to all pollinators. Interactive effects indicate potential buffering effects of high-quality food against other stressors and highlight the importance of considering synergies between multiple stressors in risk assessments. This further emphasizes the relevance of floral resources such as wild flower strips in agricultural areas to conserve pollinators and pollination services.

Pesticides have been proposed as one of the main cause of pollinators decline. Several studies show that variety of pesticides co-exist in environment and also in bee products at the same time and might therefore synergise. Fipronil, cypermethrin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid are agriculturally well known and used insecticides as well as fungicide imazalil. EBI fungicides like imazalil are functioning as detoxification inhibitor tools in insects. Thereby, the fungicide and insecticide co-occurrence might lead to synergy in bees. The cocktail-effects between insecticides and fungicides are still little studied. Aim of this study was to assess the impact of previously mentioned pesticides and their mixtures impact on bumble bee longevity and feeding rate. The bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) were fed with syrup containing different single pesticides and their combinations. Bees mortality and feeding rate was daily monitored. Here we show that 3 of these insecticides are synergising with fungicide and due that causing significant decrease in bumble bees longevity and feeding rate. The results from this experiment allows us to suppose that EBI fungicide imazalil inhibits the detoxification processes in bees and due that toxicity of insecticides increases. Although fungicides are considered as quite safe to bees when used appropriately and alone but in combination with insecticides might lead to faster individual death. Several studies have demonstrated impacts of single pesticides on bees, but yet there is a lack of data of synergistic effects. Future research should focus on synergistic effects of environmentally relevant doses of EBI fungicides and insecticides on pollinators longevity and physiology.",2018///,2018,"10.5073/jka.2018,462.052",462,,176,176,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000457670000054,,0,,0,367

The novel pesticide sulfoxaflor is a competitive modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in insects. While there is evidence of a negative impact of neonicotinoids on bees of several social organization levels, our overall knowledge on the impact of sulfoxaflor on bees is poor. Here we present for the first time a study showing effects of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor on solitary bees. Bees submitted to long term exposure of field realistic doses of sulfoxaflor (5 ¬µg dm-3, 10 ¬µg dm-3, 50 ¬µg dm-3) and control were observed regarding their survival rate. Moreover, we recorded metrics related to flower visitation and flight performance. We discover that the highest field realistic dose is lethal to Osmia bicornis along five days of exposure. The effect of sulfoxaflor reduces the outcome of foraging, important features for fruit and seed production of cross-pollinated plant species. Bees exposed to pesticide visited flowers mostly walking rather than flying. Flight performance was also impaired by the pesticide. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111869,211,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099194848&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111869&partnerID=40&md5=307fdc3360be135569cd7433a7923864,Scopus,"['analysis of covariance', 'animal', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bee survival', 'Bees', 'chromatography', 'conditioning', 'controlled study', 'correlation coefficient', 'Crop pesticide', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'environmental monitoring', 'environmental protection', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'flight behavior', 'Flight behaviour', 'flower', 'Flower visitation rate', 'flower visiting', 'Flowers', 'flying', 'foraging', 'foraging behavior', 'Hexapoda', 'honeybee', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'memory', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic receptor', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'smelling', 'structural equation modeling', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'Survival Rate', 'velocity']",,,,0,,0,368
280,JOUR,Reduction in homing flights in the honey bee Apis mellifera after a sublethal dose of neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Matsumoto, T.']",Bulletin of Insectology,"The negative effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, as the use of the chemical is expanding. Recently, special attention has been paid to the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I examined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, dinotefuran) and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose - LD50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD50 (2.18 ng/ head for clothianidin, 7.5 ng/ head for dinotefuran) or more and one-fourth LD50 (32.5 ng/ head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not significantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyrethroid.",2013///,2013,,66,1,1,9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84877647374&partnerID=40&md5=3cd1d9f5b223c005f59c51d378ee1e27,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,369

Here, the impact of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees, Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT50s) ranging from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival.

We tested if the consumption of nectar (sucrose solution) with a field-realistic concentration of 4 ppm flupyradifurone (FPF) could alter foraging behavior and recruitment dancing in Apis mellifera. Foragers were repelled by FPF. They visited the FPF feeder less often and spent less time imbibing sucrose solution (2.5 M, 65% w/w) with FPF. As a result, bees feeding on the FPF treatment consumed 16% less nectar. However, FPF did not affect dancing: there were no effects on unloading wait time, the number of dance bouts per nest visit, or the number of dance circuits performed per dance bout. FPF could therefore deter bees from foraging on contaminated nectar. However, the willingness of bees to recruit nestmates for nectar with FPF is concerning. Recruitment can rapidly amplify the number of foragers and could overcome the decrease in consumption of FPF-contaminated nectar, resulting in a net inflow of pesticide to the colony. FPF also significantly altered the expression of 116 genes, some of which may be relevant for the olfactory learning deficits induced by FPF and the toxicity of FPF. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111268,207,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090323685&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2020.111268&partnerID=40&md5=9fac6ef23821bce22b936d49571bcec4,,4-Butyrolactone; animal; animal experiment; animal tissue; Animals; Anti-feedant; antifeedant; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Article; bee; Bees; communication; Communication; concentration (composition); controlled study; drug effect; feeding behavior; Feeding Behavior; flupyradifurone; food; Food; foraging; foraging behavior; gamma butyrolactone; gene expression; genetic analysis; honeybee; insecticide; Insecticides; nectar; nonhuman; olfactory nerve disease; pesticide; physiology; Plant Nectar; pyridine derivative; Pyridines; Recruitment; recruitment (population dynamics); RNA sequencing; sublethal concentration; sublethal effect; Sublethal effects; sucrose; Sucrose; toxicity; transcriptome; unclassified drug; Waggle dancing,,0,,0,372

We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides. Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5 ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g). Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or beebread (all P > 0.05). Field surveys may underestimate honey bee exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticides or the risk of exposure in different landscapes because of low detection rates. Undetectably low levels of exposure or high levels of exposure that go undetected raise questions with regard to potential threats to honey bees and other pollinators. ¬© The Author(s) 2018.

We therefore studied the effects of a relatively new pesticide, flupyradifurone (FLU), which has been developed, in part, because it appears safer for honey bees than neonicotinoids. We tested the effects of FLU on Apis cerana olfactory learning in larvae (lower dose of 0.033 mu g/larvae/day over 6 days) and, in a separate experiment, adults (lower dose of 0.066 mu g/adult bee/day) at sublethal, field-realistic doses given over 3 days. A worst-case field-realistic dose is 0.44 mu g/bee/day. Learning was tested in adult bees. The lower larval dose did not increase mortality, but the lower adult dose resulted in 20% mortality. The lower FLU doses decreased average olfactory learning by 74% (larval treatment) and 48% (adult treatment) and reduced average memory by 48% (larval treatment) and 22% (adult treatment) as compared to controls.

Much of what is known about the non-target effects on bees comes from oral exposure in eusocial species. However, most bee species are solitary and nest below ground. For them, contaminated nesting resources may represent an important, yet understudied, route of exposure. We examined the effect of chronic contact exposure with realistic soil concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (0, 7.5, 15, or 100 ppb) during immature development on adult locomotion (movement speed and distance) and brain development of the solitary bees Osmia lignaria and Megachile rotundata. Adult locomotion and mushroom body morphology were characterized 2 (females) or 4 (males) and 14 (both sexes) days after emergence. Unlike the 0 and 7.5 ppb groups, female O. lignaria treated with 15 and 100 ppb did not move faster with age. If movement speed is associated with foraging or nest-building ability, this could result in a 25% reduction in nest provisioning efficiency over the first 14 days. Young male M. rotundata moved more quickly (7.5 and 100 ppb) and farther (100 ppb) when treated with imidacloprid, potentially increasing their ability to compete for more receptive female bees. We did not detect an effect of imidacloprid on the relative volumes of the neuropil and Kenyon cell subregions. We discuss how an environmentally persistent xenobiotic has the potential to alter population dynamics through changes in adult locomotion, even in the absence of a detectable effect on gross brain morphology. ¬© 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131177,283,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108001289&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2021.131177&partnerID=40&md5=008549debd2fcf0831c30c7a7d8f4b72,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'foraging behavior', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'Hexapoda', 'foraging', 'velocity', 'Imidacloprids', 'adult', 'locomotion', 'male', 'mushroom body', 'Male', 'Imidacloprid', 'long term exposure', 'Mushroom bodies', 'morphology', 'Morphology', 'Female', 'nesting', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'population dynamics', 'Biochemistry', 'Movement', 'Basidiomycota', 'biological development', 'Soil', 'kenyon cell', 'neuropil', 'Megachile rotundata', 'soil', 'brain development', 'Chronic contact', 'competitive ability', 'Competitive ability', 'Movement speed', 'Mushroom body', 'Nesting resource', 'Nesting resources', 'Non-target effects', 'Solitary bee']",,,,0,,0,375

Bumblebees are among the most important pollinators of temperate zone plants, making their susceptibility to neonicotinoid exposure of great concern. We report that bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies exposed to field-realistic concentrations of the commonly used neonicotinoid Imidacloprid grew slower, consumed less food, and produced fewer workers, males and gynes, but unexpectedly produced larger workers compared to control colonies. Behavioural observations show that queens in pesticide-treated colonies spend more time inactive and less time caring for the brood. We suggest that the observed effects on brood body size are driven by a decreased queen ability to manipulate the larva developmental programme. These findings reveal an intricate and previously unknown effect of insecticides on the social interactions controlling brood development in social insect colonies.

Both chemical and non-chemical stressors have been implicated as possible contributors to their decline, but the increasing use of neonicotinoid insecticides has recently emerged as particularly concerning. In this study, honey bees were exposed orally to sublethal doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin in the field in order to assess its effects on the foraging behavior, homing success, and dance communication. The foraging span and foraging activity at the contaminated feeder decreased significantly due to chronic exposure at field-realistic concentrations. Electrostatic field of dancing bees was measured and it was revealed that the number of waggle runs, the fanning time and the number of stop signals were significantly lower in the exposed colony. No difference was found in the homing success and the flight duration between control and treated bees released at a novel location within the explored area. However, a negative effect of the ambient temperature, and an influence of the location of the trained feeder was found. Finally, the residues of clothianidin accumulated in the abdomens of exposed foraging bees over time.

In case pesticide exposure to bees is likely, toxicity tests are performed with honey bees (Apis mellifera), with a tiered approach, for which validated and internationally accepted test protocols exist. However, concerns have grown regarding the protection of non-Apis bees [bumble bees (Bombus spp.), solitary and stingless bees], given their different life cycles and therefore distinct exposure routes. Larvae of solitary bees of the genus Osmia feed on unprocessed pollen during development, yet no toxicity test protocol is internationally accepted or validated to assess the impact of pesticide exposure during this stage of their life cycle. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to further validate a test protocol with two solitary bee species (O. cornuta and O. bicornis) to assess lethal and sublethal effects of pesticide exposure on larval development. Larvae were exposed to thiacloprid (neonicotinoid insecticide) mixed in a new, artificial pollen provision. Both lethal (developmental and winter mortality) and sublethal endpoints (larval development time, pollen provision consumption, cocoon weight, emergence time and adult longevity) were recorded. Effects of lower, more environmentally realistic doses were only reflected in sublethal endpoints. In both bee species, thiacloprid treatment was associated with increased developmental mortality and larval development time, and decreased pollen provision consumption and cocoon weight. The test protocol proved valid and robust and showed that for higher doses of thiacloprid the acute endpoint (larval mortality) is sufficient. In addition, new insights needed to develop a standardized test protocol were acquired, such as testing of a positive control for the first time and selection of male and female individuals at egg level. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112143,215,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102581767&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112143&partnerID=40&md5=0b628199b435a536f1bf9d7479f980a8,Scopus,"['adult', 'animal', 'animal cell', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Apis mellifera', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Bombus (genus)', 'cocoon', 'cocoon weight', 'concentration (composition)', 'concentration (parameter)', 'controlled study', 'Cornuta', 'developmental mortality', 'dose-response relationship', 'drug effect', 'embryo', 'environment', 'exposure', 'female', 'Female', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'larval development time', 'Lethal endpoints', 'lethality', 'life cycle stage', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'longevity', 'male', 'Megachilidae', 'Meliponinae', 'mortality', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Oral test protocol', 'Osmia', 'Osmia bicornis', 'Osmia cornuta', 'pesticide', 'pesticide application', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'pollen', 'Pollen', 'pollen provision consumption', 'pollution exposure', 'risk assessment', 'Solitary bee larvae', 'standardization', 'Sublethal endpoints', 'thiacloprid', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'toxicity', 'toxicity testing', 'Toxicity Tests', 'validation study', 'weight', 'winter']",,,,0,,0,378

Neonicotinoids, such as Imidacloprid, are used in many crops and have been shown to be one of the pesticides groups with the most damaging effects on the health of bee colonies. The goals of this work were (1) to evaluate the ability of Melipona quadrifasciata, a native Brazilian stingless bee species, to detect the presence of Imidacloprid in artificial diets, and (2) to evaluate how this insecticide may affect their behavior. For this purpose, behavioral experiments were carried out in observation arenas where artificial flowers containing different concentrations of Imidacloprid (0%, 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20%) were made available to forager bees and their choice and behavior were registered. Our results showed that bee choices were not affected by the different concentrations of Imidacloprid, even at extremely high doses in the flowers (20%). It was also found that the presence of this insecticide interfered with the communication between individuals as a result of reduced antennation events. Both findings, the apparent inability of bees to detect the presence of the insecticide and the change in behavior caused by the exposition to the volatilized product, may rapidly lead to colony losses in nature.",2020/03//,2020,10.18406/2316-1817v12n120201411,12,1,16,25,,,,1984-428X,WOS:000561844300002,,0,,0,379

In social species such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera, queens are essential for reproduction and colony functioning. Therefore, any negative effect of these agricultural chemicals on the mating success of queens may have serious consequences for the fitness of the entire colony. Queens were exposed to the common neonicotinoid pesticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin during their developmental stage. After mating, their spermathecae were dissected to count the number of stored spermatozoa. Furthermore, their worker offspring were genotyped with DNA microsatellites to determine the number of matings and the genotypic composition of the colony. Colonies providing the male mating partners were also inferred. Both neonicotinoid and control queens mated with drones originating from the same drone source colonies, and stored similar number of spermatozoa. However, queens reared in colonies exposed to both neonicotinoids experienced fewer matings. This resulted in a reduction of the genetic diversity in their colonies (i.e. higher intracolonial relatedness). As decreased genetic diversity among worker bees is known to negatively affect colony vitality, neonicotinoids may have a cryptic effect on colony health by reducing the mating frequency of queens.",2017/10/23/,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0186109,12,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000413403000014,,0,,0,380

Specifically, neonicotinoids, some of which are banned for outdoor use in the European Union (EU), have been pointed out as a major cause of bee collapse. Thus, farmers have had to look for alternatives for pest control and use known insecticides or new substances reportedly less harmful to bees. We evaluated the oral acute toxicity of six insecticides (three of them systemic: imidacloprid, thiacloprid and sulfoxaflor) with four different modes of action on buff-tailed bumblebee workers (Bombus terrestris): two banned neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid), two pyrethroids (deltamethrin, esfenvalerate), one sulfoximine (sulfoxaflor) and a microbial insecticide based on Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, present in genetically modified (Bt) maize. The microbial insecticide only caused mortality to bumblebee workers at extremely high concentrations, so it is expected that Bt maize does not pose a risk to them. The toxicity of the other five insecticides on bumblebees was, from highest to lowest: imidacloprid, sulfoxaflor, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate and thiacloprid. This outcome suggests that certain insecticides in use are more toxic to B. terrestris than some banned neonicotinoids. Further chronic toxicity studies, under realistic conditions, are necessary for a proper risk assessment. ¬© 2022 by the authors.

However, the sublethal effects of pesticide residue levels found in pollen and nectar on pollinators have been studied little. The aim of our research was to study whether oral exposure to the thiacloprid levels found in pollen and nectar affect the learning and long-term memory of bumble bees. We tested the effects of two exposure levels of thiacloprid-based pesticide (Calypso SC480) on buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris) in laboratory utilizing a learning performance and memory tasks designed to be difficult enough to reveal large variations across the individuals. Results: The lower exposure level of the thiacloprid-based pesticide impaired the bees‚Äô learning performance but not long-term memory compared to the untreated controls. The higher exposure level caused severe acute symptoms, due to which we were not able to test the learning and memory. Conclusions: Our results show that oral exposure to a thiacloprid-based pesticide, calculated based on residue levels found in pollen and nectar, not only causes sublethal effects but also acute lethal effects on bumble bees. Our study underlines an urgent demand for better understanding of pesticide residues in the environment, and of the effects of those residue levels on pollinators.

Numerous laboratory studies show exposure to pesticides may impair critical honey bee behaviors (brood care, foraging, egg-laying, etc.) that adversely affect colony productivity and survival. There are fewer studies that examine the impacts of pesticides in natural field settings, especially given the challenges of implementing treatment groups and controlling variables. This study helps address the need for impact studies on pollinators under field conditions to assess the consequences of chemical overuse and dependency in agricultural and urban landscapes. To assess the impact of systemic pesticides in a natural field setting on worker bee behavioral development, observation hives were established to monitor changes in behaviors of similarly aged workers and sister queens within 2 experimental groups: (i) colonies located near point-source systemic pesticide pollution (pesticide contaminated treatment), and (ii) colonies embedded within a typical Midwestern US agricultural environment (control). In this study, worker bees in the contaminated environment exhibited important and biologically significant behavioral differences and accelerated onset of hive tasks (i.e., precocious behavioral development) compared to similarly aged bees at the control site. Queen locomotion was largely unaffected; however, the egg-laying rate was reduced in queens at the contaminated (treated) site. These results show that environmental pesticide exposure can disrupt colony function and adversely affect worker bee behavioral maturation, leading to reduced worker longevity and decreased colony efficiency. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1093/jisesa/ieae034,24,3,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85194828370&doi=10.1093%2fjisesa%2fieae034&partnerID=40&md5=a0b7054f301b71313b26d316413dfc41,Scopus,"['age polyethism', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'drug effect', 'female', 'Female', 'gene expression', 'growth, development and aging', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'seed treatment', 'toxicology']",,,,0,,0,383

The global decline of insects is therefore a cause for concern, and the role of chemical pesticides must be examined carefully. The lethal effects of insecticides are well understood, but sub-lethal concentrations have not been studied in sufficient detail. We therefore used the western honeybee Apis mellifera as a model to test the effect of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin on the movement, biosensory abilities and odor-dependent conditioning of insects, titrating from lethal to sub-lethal doses. Bees treated with sub-lethal doses showed no significant movement impairment compared to untreated control bees, but their ability to react to an aversive stimulus was inhibited. These results show that clothianidin is not only highly toxic to honeybees, but can, at lower doses, also disrupt the biosensory capabilities of survivors, probably reducing fitness at the individual level. In our study, sub-lethal doses of clothianidin altered the biosensory abilities of the honeybee; possible consequences at the colony level are discussed. ¬© 2019 by the authors.",2019///,2019,10.3390/insects10100340,10,10,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073571757&doi=10.3390%2finsects10100340&partnerID=40&md5=67f83daae4cc4b47b0e7a4dcca857d4a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,384

In this work, we evaluated the toxicity of botanical extracts with homemade preparations used in agroecological crops and their constituents on the bees Apis mellifera and Partamona helleri. Toxicity bioassays of adult bees were done by means of oral exposure and ingestion, using the insecticide imidacloprid as a positive control. Dietary consumption, respiration rate and bee flight were evaluated as sublethal parameters. Although some extracts were toxic to bees, survival was always higher compared to the results obtained with the imidacloprid, which was lethal to 100% of bees. In dietary consumption, P. helleri consumed less (5 mg/bee) in 3 h than A. mellifera (11 mg/bee), and P. helleri consumed less (7 mg/bee) in 24 h than A. mellifera (22 mg/bee). There was no difference in consumption of food containing plant extracts or food containing water only. We did not detect any adverse effects of the botanical extracts on bee respiration rates or flight. The major constituent of N. tabacum is nicotine (8.4‚Äì15.1%), in A. americana it is Œ≤-caryophyllene (11.3%), and in A. colubrina, lupeol (12.2%).

407,JOUR,No evidence for negative impacts of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on bee olfactory conditioning or working memory,"['Siviter, H.', 'Scott, A.', 'Pasquier, G.', 'Pull, C.D.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",PeerJ,"Systemic insecticides such as neonicotinoids and sulfoximines can be present in the nectar and pollen of treated crops, through which foraging bees can become acutely exposed. Research has shown that acute, field realistic dosages of neonicotinoids can negatively influence bee learning and memory, with potential consequences for bee behaviour. As legislative reassessment of neonicotinoid use occurs globally, there is an urgent need to understand the potential risk of other systemic insecticides. Sulfoxaflor, the first branded sulfoximine-based insecticide, has the same mode of action as neonicotinoids, and may potentially replace them over large geographical ranges. Here we assessed the impact of acute sulfoxaflor exposure on performance in two paradigms that have previously been used to illustrate negative impacts of neonicotinoid pesticides on bee learning and memory. We assayed whether acute sulfoxaflor exposure influences (a) olfactory conditioning performance in both bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera), using a proboscis extension reflex assay, and (b) working memory performance of bumblebees, using a radial-arm maze. We found no evidence to suggest that sulfoxaflor influenced performance in either paradigm. Our results suggest that despite a shared mode of action between sulfoxaflor and neonicotinoidbased insecticides, widely-documented effects of neonicotinoids on bee cognition may not be observed with sulfoxaflor, at least at acute exposure regimes.

Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed honeybee colonies and quantity of hive products. A higher-tier field toxicology study indicated a no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 29.5¬†¬µg TMX/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose (NOAED) of 8.6¬†ng/bee/day for all responses measured. For exposures via deposition of dust, a conservative no-observed-adverse-effect-rate at the level of the colony was 0.1¬†g TMX/ha. There was minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to TMX via nectar and pollen from its use as a seed-treatment. For exposures via dust and dust/seed applications, there were no concentrations above the risk values for TMX in nectar and pollen. Although some risks were identified for potential exposures via guttation fluid, this route of exposure is incomplete; no apparent adverse effects were observed in field studies. For exposures via dust/seed and dust/foliar applications, few adverse effects were observed. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable. However, the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion. The overall weight of evidence based on many studies indicates that TMX has no adverse effects on viability or survival of the colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that the treatment of seeds with thiamethoxam, as currently used in good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388568,20,06-Jul,365,382,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85036570302&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388568&partnerID=40&md5=caf3b85e15ff10f896cae621455c9207,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,387

Methods used to study learning processes and foraging behaviour were adapted to test the sublethal effects of the insecticide molecule imidacloprid (chloronicotinyl) at both individual and colony levels under confined conditions. At the individual level, we studied the effects of long term ingestion of 4-40 ppb imidacloprid (11 days administration) on olfactory learning performances using the olfactory conditioning of proboscis extension on restrained bees. At the colony level, a sugar solution containing 50 ppb of imidacloprid was fed to a colony in a flight cage (14 days administration) to determine the effects (1) on the flight activity as measured with an activity counter set at the hive entrance and (2) on the olfactory discrimination performances on an artificial flower feeder. The olfactory conditioning showed that honey bees surviving the diet contaminated with imidacloprid had reduced olfactory learning performances. Only the concentration of 4 ppb induced a percentage of mortality not significantly different from the control diet after long term ingestion. In the flight cage, the administration of imidacloprid led to a decrease in the flight activity and the olfactory discrimination performances. Thus, the decrease in the learning performances induced by imidacloprid at the individual level was confirmed at the colony level.

511,JOUR,Neonicotinoid-induced impairment of odour coding in the honeybee,"['Andrione, M', 'Vallortigara, G', 'Antolini, R', 'Haase, A']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is considered one of the possible causes of honeybee (Apis mellifera) population decline. At sublethal doses, these chemicals have been shown to negatively affect a number of behaviours, including performance of olfactory learning and memory, due to their interference with acetylcholine signalling in the mushroom bodies. Here we provide evidence that neonicotinoids can affect odour coding upstream of the mushroom bodies, in the first odour processing centres of the honeybee brain, i.e. the antennal lobes (ALs). In particular, we investigated the effects of imidacloprid, the most common neonicotinoid, in the AL glomeruli via in vivo two-photon calcium imaging combined with pulsed odour stimulation. Following acute imidacloprid treatment, odour-evoked calcium response amplitude in single glomeruli decreases, and at the network level the representations of different odours are no longer separated. This demonstrates that, under neonicotinoid influence, olfactory information might reach the mushroom bodies in a form that is already incorrect. Thus, some of the impairments in olfactory learning and memory caused by neonicotinoids could, in fact, arise from the disruption in odor coding and olfactory discrimination ability of the honey bees.",2016/12/01/,2016,10.1038/srep38110,6,,2045-2322,WOS:000389659800001,,,,,,,0,,0,392
104,JOUR,Lethal and sublethal side-effect assessment supports a more benign profile of spinetoram compared with spinosad in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris,"['Besard, L.', 'Mommaerts, V.', 'Abdu-Alla, G.', 'Smagghe, G.']",Pest Management Science,"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to identify the potential side effects of the novel naturalyte insecticide spinetoram in comparison with spinosad on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. The potential lethal effects together with the ecologically relevant sublethal effects on aspects of bumblebee reproduction and foraging behaviour were evaluated. Bumblebee workers were exposed via direct contact with wet and dry residues under laboratory conditions to spinetoram at different concentrations, starting from the maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC) and then different dilutions (1/10, 1/100, 1/1000 and 1/10 000 of the MFRC), and compared with spinosad. In addition, the side effects via oral exposure in supplemented sugar water were assessed. RESULTS: Direct contact of B. terrestris workers with wet residues of spinosad and spinetoram showed spinetoram to be approximately 52 times less toxic than spinosad, while exposure to dry residues of spinetoram was about 8 times less toxic than exposure to those of spinosad. Oral treatment for 72 h (acute) indicated that spinetoram is about 4 times less toxic to B. terrestris workers compared with spinosad, while exposure for a longer period (i.e. 11 weeks) showed spinetoram to be 24 times less toxic. In addition, oral exposure to the two spinosyns resulted in detrimental sublethal effects on bumblebee reproduction. The no observed effect concentration (NOEC) for spinosad was 1/1000 of the MFRC, and 1/100 of the MFRC for spinetoram. Comparison between the chronic exposure bioassays assessing the sublethal effects on nest reproduction, with and without allowing for foraging behaviour, showed that the respective NOEC values for spinosad and spinetoram were similar over the two bioassays, indicating that there were no adverse effects by either spinosyn on the foraging of B. terrestris workers. CONCLUSION: Overall, the present results indicate that the use of spinetoram is safer for bumblebees by direct contact and oral exposure than the use of spinosad, and therefore it can be applied safely in combination with B. terrestris. Another important conclusion is that the present data provide strong evidence that neither spinosyn has a negative effect on the foraging behaviour of these beneficial insects. However, before drawing final conclusions, spinetoram and spinosad should also be evaluated in more realistic field-related situations for the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour with the use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris. ¬© 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.",2011///,2011,10.1002/ps.2093,67,5,541,547,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953744717&doi=10.1002%2fps.2093&partnerID=40&md5=9024a2303a41820a3bc0de393e80fa47,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,393

Here, we report the identification and characterization of two genes, designated AccGtpx-1 and AccGtpx-2, encoding PHGPX proteins from the Chinese honeybees, Apis cerana cerana. Alignment analysis showed that AccGtpx-1 and AccGtpx-2 shared high similarity with other known PHGPXs, which show similar structure to thioredoxin. These single copy genes showed complex exon-intron structures. The mRNA of AccGtpx-1 was detected in larvae, pupae and adults and that AccGtpx-2 was only found in adult worker bees. Furthermore, the expression of AccGtpx-1 could be induced by H2O2, ultraviolet (UV) light, heat shock (37 degrees C), HgCl2, imidacloprid, cyhalothrin, pyriproxyfen and methomyl. In contrast, AccGtpx-2 expression could only be induced by UV. These results indicated for the first time that the AccGtpx-1 and AccGtpx-2 genes encoding A. cerana cerana PHGPXs are regulated differently in response to environmental stressors.

Targeting neuronal receptors, they have deleterious effects on the behaviour and physiology of many insects. Bees are exposed to these insecticides in pollen and nectar while providing pollination services to agricultural crops, and neonicotinoids have been shown to impair navigation and decrease their foraging activity. We have previously reported the effect of dietary thiamethoxam on sucrose responsiveness of young worker bees. Here, we exposed caged foragers to sublethal acute doses of clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, then tested them individually for sucrose responsiveness using standard methods. In addition, we tested the response to a range of sucrose solutions laced with neonicotinoids on bees previously unexposed to neonicotinoids. This paradigm mimics the situation where foragers would first encounter poisoned nectars varying in sugar concentration. Bees were exposed to the insecticides in the feeding solution for 24 h before testing, or in the test solutions, or both. The three compounds had a detrimental effect on responses to mid-to-high sucrose concentrations under all experimental conditions, and unexposed bees tested with laced sucrose displayed unexpected low responses to the higher sucrose concentrations tested. This attenuation of sucrose response is further evidence that neonicotinoids are multisensory disruptors, with potent actions against pollinators and other beneficial insects at first contact. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2018.05.004,108,,25,30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047072417&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2018.05.004&partnerID=40&md5=7d6176f3ad76f3ba949779e4801b93e0,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,395

We assessed the impact of exposure to these two pesticides individually and in combination, at a range of field-realistic doses. In laboratory assays, mortality of larvae treated with captan was 80‚Äì90% greater than controls, dose-independent, and similar to mortality from the lowest dose of thiamethoxam. There was evidence of synergism (i.e., a non-additive response) from captan-thiamethoxam co-exposure at the highest dose of thiamethoxam, but not at lower doses. In the field, we exposed whole colonies to the lowest doses used in the laboratory. Exposure to captan and thiamethoxam individually and in combination resulted in minimal impacts on population growth or colony mortality, and there was no evidence of synergism or antagonism. These results suggest captan and thiamethoxam are each acutely toxic to immature honey bees, but whole colonies can potentially compensate for detrimental effects, at least at the low doses used in our field trial, or that methodological differences of the field experiment impacted results (e.g., dilution of treatments with natural pollen). If compensation occurred, further work is needed to assess how it occurred, potentially via increased queen egg laying, and whether short-term compensation leads to long-term costs. Further work is also needed for other crop pollinators that lack the social detoxification capabilities of honey bee colonies and may be less resilient to pesticides. ¬© The Author(s) 2024.",2024///,2024,10.1038/s41598-024-66248-x,14,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85197714752&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-024-66248-x&partnerID=40&md5=b5b1eb5a1c9317fe2f5dac5df9782944,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'Antagonism', 'Apis mellifera', 'bee', 'Bees', 'captan', 'Captan', 'drug effect', 'drug potentiation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ecotoxicology', 'fungicide', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'In vitro rearing', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'physiology', 'Synergism', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles']",,,,0,,0,397

The AmŒ±1/Œ≤2 subunit ratio influenced the efficacy of imidacloprid and thiacloprid, but hardly affected that of clothianidin. Hydrogen bond formation by the NH group in clothianidin with the main chain carbonyl of the loop B may account, at least in part, for the unique agonist actions of clothianidin on the hybrid nAChRs tested. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020///,2020,10.1016/j.pestbp.2020.02.011,166,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081242233&doi=10.1016%2fj.pestbp.2020.02.011&partnerID=40&md5=85653ef4befcda8166d5834df1065730,Scopus,,,0,,0,398

One potential threat to bees is the unintended impact of systemic insecticides, which are ingested by bees in the nectar and pollen from flowers of treated crops. To establish whether imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid and insect neurotoxin, harms individual bees when ingested at environmentally realistic levels, we exposed adult worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), and honey bees, Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae), to dietary imidacloprid in feeder syrup at dosages between 0.08 and 125Œºgl-1. Honey bees showed no response to dietary imidacloprid on any variable that we measured (feeding, locomotion and longevity). In contrast, bumble bees progressively developed over time a dose-dependent reduction in feeding rate with declines of 10-30% in the environmentally relevant range of up to 10Œºgl-1, but neither their locomotory activity nor longevity varied with diet. To explain their differential sensitivity, we speculate that honey bees are better pre-adapted than bumble bees to feed on nectars containing synthetic alkaloids, such as imidacloprid, by virtue of their ancestral adaptation to tropical nectars in which natural alkaloids are prevalent. We emphasise that our study does not suggest that honey bee colonies are invulnerable to dietary imidacloprid under field conditions, but our findings do raise new concern about the impact of agricultural neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. ¬© 2012 Elsevier GmbH.",2012///,2012,10.1016/j.zool.2012.05.003,115,6,365,371,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870240538&doi=10.1016%2fj.zool.2012.05.003&partnerID=40&md5=f9694f4c3af4c4e61190c0e36dc908fa,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,399

Pesticides and the loss of food resources from flowering plants are two stressors known to act together to impair bee fitness. The impact of these stressors on key behaviors like foraging and nesting can limit pollination services and population persistence, making it critical to understand these sublethal effects. We investigated the effects of insecticide exposure and floral resource limitation on the foraging and nesting behavior of the solitary blue orchard bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in field cages foraged on wildflowers at high or low densities, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design. Both stressors influenced behavior, but they had differential impacts. Bees with limited food resources made fewer, but longer foraging trips and misidentified their nests more often. Insecticide exposure reduced bee foraging activity. Additionally, insecticides interacted with bee age to influence antagonistic behavior among neighboring females, such that insecticide-exposed bees were less antagonistic with age. Our findings point towards mechanisms underlying effects on populations and ecosystem function and reinforce the importance of studying multiple drivers to understand the consequences of anthropogenic change. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161392,867,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85146048930&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.161392&partnerID=40&md5=17302dd2e032643e38416c63ee8e913d,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'pollination', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'bee pollination', 'controlled study', 'female', 'foraging behavior', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Plants (botany)', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'environmental exposure', 'Pesticide', 'environmental protection', 'flower', 'adult', 'Neonicotinoid', 'social behavior', 'sublethal dose', 'male', 'fitness', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'Ecosystems', 'Pollinator', 'age distribution', 'agriculture', 'Agriculture', 'environmental impact', 'environmental stress', 'Female', 'Flower resource', 'Flower resources', 'Flowering plants', 'food processing', 'Food resources', 'human impact (environment)', 'Natural ecosystem', 'negative reinforcement', 'nesting', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'Population persistences', 'population structure', 'Resource limitations', 'Stressor', 'Stressors']",,,,0,,0,400

Traditionally, most laboratory studies on bee ecotoxicology test acute exposure to single compounds. However, under field conditions, bees are often chronically exposed to a variety of chemicals, with potential synergistic effects. We studied the effects of field-realistic concentrations of three pesticides measured in pollen and nectar of commercial melon fields on the solitary bee Osmia bicornis L. We orally exposed females of this species throughout their life span to 8 treatments combining two neonicotinoid insecticides (acetamiprid, imidacloprid) and a triazole fungicide (myclobutanil) via pollen and sugar syrup. We measured pollen and syrup consumption, longevity, ovary maturation and thermogenesis. Pesticide intake was three orders of magnitude higher via syrup than pollen. At the tested concentrations, no synergistic effects emerged, and we found no effects on longevity and ovary maturation. However, all treatments containing imidacloprid resulted in suppressed syrup consumption and drastic decreases in thoracic temperature and bee activity. Our results have important implications for pesticide regulation. If we had measured only lethal effects we would have wrongly concluded that the pesticide combinations containing imidacloprid were safe to O. bicornis. The incorporation of tests specifically intended to detect sublethal effects in bee risk assessment schemes should be an urgent priority. In this way, the effects of pesticide exposure on the dynamics of bee populations in agroecosystems will be better assessed. ¬© 2019, The Author(s).",2019///,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-50255-4,9,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072622740&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-019-50255-4&partnerID=40&md5=fc7d8ff66d005e23e33d811118ff32e0,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,403
299,JOUR,"Neonicotinoid pesticide applications affect pollinator abundance and visitation, leading to implications for sunflower production (Helianthus annuus L.)","['Saleem, M.S.', 'Akbar, M.F.', 'Javed, M.A.', 'Sultan, A.']",Cogent Food and Agriculture,"Pesticides are considered a risk to pollinators; however, little is known about the possible effects of their injudicious use on pollinators, including the ecosystem services provided to crops and wildflowers. Recently, great attention has been paid to the effects of neonicotinoids pesticides on pollinators and their potential role in harming the health of bees all over the world. Sunflowers, being self-incompatible plants, rely on insects, primarily bees, for effective cross-pollination and successful seed-set. Ensuring the presence of sufficient pollinators in the field is crucial for facilitating pollen movement between flowers and promoting optimal seed development. However, the reliance on insect-mediated cross-pollination also makes sunflowers susceptible to pest attacks, which can negatively impact seed production. To mitigate these potential threats and achieve increased seed yields, careful consideration is given to the judicious use of pesticides. Striking the right balance between providing adequate pollinators and implementing appropriate pest management strategies is vital for maximizing sunflower crop productivity. To reveal such potential impacts of neonicotinoid insecticides, we undergo the current study that aimed to estimate flower visitation and pollination in a sunflower crop by applying three neonicotinoid insecticides i.e. imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, including the control group for two years i.e. 2020, and 2021. In all experimental plots, we quantified floral visitors for fourteen days at three different times (8 am, 12 pm, and 5 pm). Floral visitors were divided into three groups, Apis bees, Non-Apis bees, and butterflies. After the maturation period, the achenes from each capitulum were separated and brought for weight. We discovered that this study confirmed the adverse effect of neonicotinoids pesticides on sunflower production. Our research revealed that the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam had a negative impact on the visitation of Apis bees, with reductions of 19%, 18.5%, and 23% respectively, as compared to the control group during the year 2020. Furthermore, these pesticides also caused a decrease in the visitation of Non-Apis bees by 15%, 15%, and 17% respectively. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 17.4%, 14.6%, and 15.8% for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam respectively. Based on our research conducted in the year 2021, the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam caused a reduction of 22.5%, 24%, and 25.5% respectively in the visitation of Apis bees, as compared to the control group. Similarly, non-Apis bees experienced a decrease in visitation by 19.5%, 23.5%, and 25% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. The visitation of butterflies was also affected, with reductions of 18.2%, 22.2%, and 26% respectively for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that the use of these pesticides affected the diversity of floral visitors and contributed to a decline in the number of fruit during the year 2020 and 2021. Moreover, the abundance of floral visitors, the mass of fruits, and the quantity of oil in the seeds were significantly lower after treatment with neonicotinoid pesticides, thus evidencing its negative effect on sunflower productivity.

To date, several tests exist to assess lethal and sublethal side-effects of pesticides on bee survival, growth/development and reproduction. Within the context of ecotoxicology and insect physiology, we report the development of a new bioassay to assess the impact of sublethal concentrations on the bumblebee foraging behavior under laboratory conditions. In brief, the experimental setup of this behavior test consists of two artificial nests connected with a tube of about 20 cm and use of queenless micro-colonies of 5 workers. In one nest the worker bees constructed brood, and in the other food (sugar and pollen) was provided. Before exposure, the worker bees were allowed a training to forage for untreated food; afterwards this was replaced by treated food. Using this setup we investigated the effects of sublethal concentrations of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, known to negatively affect the foraging behavior of bees. For comparison within the family of neonicotinoid insecticides, we also tested different concentrations of two other neonicotinoids: thiamethoxam and thiacloprid, in the laboratory with the new bioassay. Finally to evaluate the new bioassay, we also tested sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid in the greenhouse with use of queenright colonies of B. terrestris, and here worker bees needed to forage/fly for food that was placed at a distance of 3 m from their hives. In general, the experiments showed that concentrations that may be considered safe for bumblebees can have a negative influence on their foraging behavior. Therefore it is recommended that behavior tests should be included in risk assessment tests for highly toxic pesticides because impairment of the foraging behavior can result in a decreased pollination, lower reproduction and finally in colony mortality due to a lack of food. ¬© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",2010///,2010,10.1007/s10646-009-0406-2,19,1,207,215,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77249087124&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-009-0406-2&partnerID=40&md5=0a4b49f9dcca309b6d08542d84bf255f,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,405
329,JOUR,Comparative chronic toxicity of three neonicotinoids on New Zealand packaged honey bees,"['Wood, S.C.', 'Kozii, I.V.', 'Koziy, R.V.', 'Epp, T.', 'Simko, E.']",PLoS ONE,"Background Thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid are the most commonly used neonicotinoid insecticides on the Canadian prairies. There is widespread contamination of nectar and pollen with neonicotinoids, at concentrations which are sublethal for honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus). Objective We compared the effects of chronic, sublethal exposure to the three most commonly used neonicotinoids on honey bee colonies established from New Zealand packaged bees using colony weight gain, brood area, and population size as measures of colony performance. Methods From May 7 to July 29, 2016 (12 weeks), sixty-eight colonies received weekly feedings of sugar syrup and pollen patties containing 0 nM, 20 nM (median environmental dose), or 80 nM (high environmental dose) of one of three neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid). Colonies were weighed at three-week intervals. Brood area and population size were determined from digital images of colonies at week 12. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA and mixed models. Results There was a significant negative effect (-30%, p<0.01) on colony weight gain (honey production) after 9 and 12 weeks of exposure to 80 nM of thiamethoxam, clothianidin, or imidacloprid and on bee cluster size (-21%, p<0.05) after 12 weeks. Analysis of brood area and number of adult bees lacked adequate (>80%) statistical power to detect an effect. Conclusions Chronic exposure of honey bees to high environmental doses of neonicotinoids has negative effects on honey production. Brood area appears to be less sensitive to detect sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. ¬© 2018 Wood et al.

However, they have been found to negatively affect bees, especially Apis mellifera. Despite this, little research has been conducted on the impact of neonicotinoids on other bee species, including native ones. This study aimed to assess the risks to native bees exposed to low concentrations of imidacloprid (IMI). The Tetragona clavipes (bee native to Brazil) were exposed to eight concentrations of IMI-based insecticide, through contaminated food or mist (350 ¬µL/min) for 24¬†h. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, LC90-24¬†h in acute topical effect (ATE) and¬†acute residual effect (ARE)¬†of IMI-based insecticide against bees were calculated. The LC10-24¬†h, LC50-24¬†h, and LC90-24¬†h in ARE were found to be more toxic compared to ATE. In summary, the study highlights that even low levels of IMI can significantly reduce bee survival within 24¬†h. The urgency to tackle the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides on native bee populations is evident. Preserving bees is crucial for ensuring sustainability, food security, and ecosystem integrity.

Effects of imidacloprid food stores contaminants were examined in subtropical colonies that experience reduced brood rearing and foraging during overwintering. Colonies were given treatment sugar syrup containing 0 ppb (control), 20 ppb (field relevant), or 100 ppb (above field relevant) imidacloprid over six weeks to simulate contaminated fall nectar. Colonies were evaluated immediately (post-treatment) and 10 weeks (mid-winter) after treatment to compare proximal and latent effects. Post-treatment 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies while 0 ppb colonies more brood than 20 ppb or 100 ppb colonies. Mid-winter 0 ppb and 20 ppb colonies had more workers than 100 ppb colonies and 0 ppb colonies more brood than 100 ppb colonies. Colonies experienced seasonal declines in stored pollen but no treatment effects. Lower 100 ppb colony performance was associated with reduced effort rather than lifespan. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tracking revealed that workers had similar adult lifespans across treatments; however, 100 ppb workers engaged in activities outside the colony for less time than 0 ppb workers. Imidacloprid exposure affected queen but not worker nutritional physiology. Nurses retained well-developed hypopharyngeal glands (as indicated by head protein) across treatments. Mid-winter queens from 0 ppb colonies had marginally higher ovary protein than queens from 100 ppb colonies and more ovary lipids than queens from 20 ppb colonies. However, queen nutrient stores in non-reproductive tissues (fat bodies) did not differ across treatments. Queens from different treatments were attended by comparable numbers of retinue workers and had similar gland contents of four QMP (Queen Mandibular Pheromone) components essential to queen care.

Most studies on their influence on pollinators have focused on honey bees given the suitability of this insect for controlled behavioral testing and raising. Yet, studies on pesticide impact should also contemplate tropical species, which contribute a major part of biodiversity and which have remained so far neglected. Here we focused on the stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata and asked if the widely used neonicotinoid imidacloprid disrupts its learning and memory capabilities. We fed stingless bees with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 ng of imidacloprid, tested their innate appetitive responsiveness and trained them to associate odors and sucrose reward using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. The same experiments were performed on Africanized honey bees. One hour after intoxication, both species decreased their innate responsiveness to sucrose but the effect was more accentuated in stingless bees. In both species, learning and memory were affected in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that pesticides have dramatic consequences on tropical bee species and claim for rational policies regulating their use in the tropics. ¬© 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162859,877,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150389786&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.162859&partnerID=40&md5=a9002a32d506e67b0347b0a4792945e0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'conditioning', 'honeybee', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory', 'memory disorder', 'sucrose', 'smelling', 'Imidacloprids', 'stingless bee', 'Honey bee', 'Sugar (sucrose)', 'odor', 'Learning and memory', 'learning disorder', 'Pollinators', 'Pollinator', 'appetitive behavior', 'Stingless bee', 'biodiversity', 'Biodiversity', 'Stingless bees', 'concentration response', 'reward', 'intoxication', 'Africanized honey bee', 'Africanized honey bees', 'anthropogenic effect', 'Anthropogenic factors', 'Appetitive responsiveness', 'association', 'behavioral ecology', 'Tropical species', 'Tropics']",,,,0,,0,409

However, the global decline of bee populations is a serious concern. Insecticides are considered crucial factors affecting bee survival. In this study, the acute toxicity of selected synthetic insecticides (imidacloprid, profenofos, and lambda-cyhalothrin) on a stingless bee, Tetragonula pagdeni (Schwarz) (Hymenoptera Apidae), was investigated and the LD50 and LC50 determined through topical, oral, and contact exposure under laboratory conditions. The estimated topical LD50 values for imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, and profenofos were 0.06, 0.53, and 45.39 ng active ingredient (a.i.)/bee, respectively. The corresponding estimated LD 50 values from oral bioassays were 0.66, 7.52, and 75.04 ng a.i./bee, and LC50 values for contact exposure were 48.74, 4,339.83, and 3,062.81 ng a.i./cm(2) . Overall, imidacloprid exhibited the highest toxicity among the evaluated insecticides for all routes of exposure. In addition, insecticide toxicity was higher in the topical bioassay than in oral and contact bioassays. These findings demonstrate that this stingless bee is extremely vulnerable to insecticide use.

However, potential long-lasting or delayed effects resulting from an acute exposure (e.g. a single dose) are often overlooked, although the modification of a developmental process may have life-long consequences. To investigate this question, we exposed young honeybee workers to a single sublethal field-realistic dose of a neurotoxic pesticide, sulfoxaflor, at one of two amounts (16 or 60 ng), at the moment when they initiated orientation flights (preceding foraging activity). We then tracked in the field their flight activity and lifespan with automated life-long monitoring devices. Both amounts of sulfoxaflor administered reduced the total number of flights but did not affect bee survival and flight duration. When looking at the time series of flight activity, effects were not immediate but delayed until foraging activity with a decrease in the daily number of foraging flights and consequently in their total number (24 and 33% less for the 16 and 60 ng doses, respectively). The results of our study therefore blur the general assumption in honeybee toxicology that acute exposure results in immediate and rapid effects and call for long-term recording and/or time-to-effect measurements, even upon exposure to a single dose of pesticide. ¬© 2021",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150351,805,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114984109&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2021.150351&partnerID=40&md5=88cf178a7d135cd1894a0f2a45089ecb,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'ecotoxicology', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'environmental exposure', 'honeybee', 'sucrose', 'survival analysis', 'foraging', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'Sublethal effects', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'survival rate', 'flight', 'pesticide residue', 'adult', 'comparative study', 'Eco-toxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'nectar', 'short term exposure', 'flight activity', 'unclassified drug', 'experimental study', 'Acute exposure', 'Acute toxicity', 'liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'neurotoxicity', 'Bee', 'clinical assessment', 'biological monitoring', 'orientation', 'neurotoxin', 'practice guideline', 'Flight activity', 'immunocompetence', 'image analysis', 'Delayed effects', 'developmental process', 'normal distribution', 'pollen allergy', 'Single-dose']",,,,0,,0,411

Because of the haplo-diploid sex determination system in hymenopterans, experiments using micro-colonies (small sub colonies without a queen) to identify risks to bumblebee health are limited as they are only able to produce males. Therefore, an experimental protocol for rearing bumblebee larvae in vitro is needed to better understand effects on worker larvae. Here, we aimed to establish a rearing method for larvae of Bombus terrestris for use in risk assessment assays. To confirm the validity of our rearing method, we tested two insecticides used for tomato cultivation, chlorfenapyr and dinotefuran. Bombus terrestris larvae fed with a high nutrient quantity and quality diet increased growth per day. All chlorfenapyr-exposed individuals died within 10¬†days at 2000-fold dilution, an application dose used for tomatoes. There were significant differences in adult emergence rate among almost all chlorfenapyr treatments. On the other hand, sublethal dinotefuran-exposure did not affect rates of pupation and adult emergence, growth, or larval and pupal periods. Although larvae were smaller than in the natural colony, this rearing method for B. terrestris larvae proved to be effective at evaluating realistic sub-colonies to pesticide exposures. ¬© 2022, The Author(s).",2022///,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-19965-0,12,1,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138350597&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-022-19965-0&partnerID=40&md5=587842141e7d2a3bc8364f604f12f8d8,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'human', 'Humans', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'larva', 'Larva', 'toxicity testing', 'male', 'Male', 'Toxicity Tests', 'dinotefuran', 'chlorfenapyr']",,,,0,,0,412

In recent years, neonicotinoids are widely used against a broad spectrum sucking pests. However, they also pose a major threat to the beekeeping industry. The present study aimed to quantify the impact of thiamethoxam, a second-generation, broad-spectrum neonicotinoid on foraging behavior, colony performance, and survival of Apis mellifera L. in mustard crop under semi-field (cage) and field conditions. Under semi-field conditions, the foraging activity of A. mellifera on mustard bloom reduced significantly on the 2nd day after spray of thiamethoxam as compared to pre-count and control. Significant decrease in brood area (7th to 21st day), nectar stores (7th to 28th day), and pollen stores (7th to 21st day) were also recorded after the spray.

While it is known that nectar and pollen provide macronutrients, flowers also contain secondary metabolites (phytochemicals) that impart benefits including increased longevity, improved gut microbiome abundance, and pathogen tolerance. Our study aims to understand the role of phytochemicals in pesticide tolerance when worker bees were fed with sublethal doses (1 ppb and 10 ppb) of thiamethoxam (TMX), a neonicotinoid, in 20% (w/v) sugar solution supplemented with 25 ppm of phytochemicals - caffeine, kaempferol, gallic acid, or p-coumaric acid, previously shown to have beneficial impacts on bee health. The effect of phytochemical supplementation during pesticide exposure was context-dependent. With 1 ppb TMX, phytochemical supplementation increased longevity but at 10 ppb TMX, longevity was reduced suggesting a negative synergistic effect. Phytochemicals mixed with 1 ppb TMX increased mortality in bees of the forager-age group but with 10 ppb TMX, mortality of the inhive-age group increased, implying the possibility of accumulation effect in lower sublethal doses. Given that the phytochemical composition of pollen and nectar varies between plant species, we suggest that the negative impacts of agrochemicals on honey bees could vary based on the phytochemicals in pollen and nectar of that crop, and hence the effects may vary across crops. Analyzing the phytochemical composition for individual crops may be a necessary first step prior to determining the appropriate dosage of agrochemicals so that harm to bees Apis mellifera L. is minimized while crop pests are effectively controlled. ¬© 2021 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2021.",2021///,2021,10.1093/jisesa/ieab053,21,4,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114690801&doi=10.1093%2fjisesa%2fieab053&partnerID=40&md5=13964c9033de5e523ac2d2d3aec523c0,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'pollinator', 'thiamethoxam', 'Thiamethoxam', 'honey bee', 'phytochemical', 'synergism', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'kaempferol', 'coumaric acid', 'caffeine', 'Phytochemicals', 'p-coumaric acid', 'Caffeine', 'Coumaric Acids', 'dietary supplement', 'Dietary Supplements', 'gallic acid', 'Gallic Acid', 'kaempferol derivative', 'Kaempferols']",,,,0,,0,414

Based on available data (USEPA 2014), this insecticide appears to have a favorable safety profile for honey bee colonies. As a result, the label permits the product to be applied during prebloom and bloom in various crops, including citrus, except when mixed with azole fungicides during the blooming period. We placed 24 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) colonies adjacent to eight flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) fields that either had been sprayed with the maximum label rate of flupyradifurone or with water only (control fields), with three colonies placed adjacent to each field. We conducted colony strength assessments during which the number of adult bees, eggs, uncapped brood cells, capped brood cells, food storage cells, and weights of honey supers and brood chambers were determined prior to, during, and after the flowering period. We also analyzed bee-collected pollen and nectar for flupyradifurone residues. Overall, there were no differences in any colony strength parameter for colonies placed at control and flupyradifurone-treated buckwheat fields. Residue analyses showed that pollen (x = 565.8 ppb) and nectar (x = 259.4 ppb) gathered by bees on fields treated with flupyradifurone contained significantly higher flupyradifurone residues than did bee bread and unprocessed nectar collected by bees from control fields (75% of samples <LOD).

Among several environmental factors (e.g. climate and bee pathogens), stress factors arising from agricultural practices can potentially play a role in bee losses. Detailed knowledge on the effects of plant protection products is essential to improve usage with minimal risks. In order to identify potential medium- and long-term effects, we followed up various sublethal contaminated hives during the prolongation of the fruit-growing season. More specifically, a large-scale experiment was conducted in which at four distinct locations (in the Limburg region of Belgium) four different bee colonies (representing three different contaminations -imidacloprid, fenoxycarb, indoxacarb- and a non-contaminated control hive) were thoroughly monitored every 2-7 days. Our observations point towards decays of overall colony vitality for several hives a couple of weeks after treatment, as indicated by a set of carefully assessed parameters including the total amount of active and dead bees, total surface of capped brood and overall colony weight. These outcomes could be linked to subtle differences in foraging activity between distinct hives. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of potential short-term and long-term consequences of disturbed foraging ability triggered by exaggerated exposure to sublethal doses of crop protection chemicals, and its potential impact on colony health.",2009///,2009,,74,1,245,253,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77950468932&partnerID=40&md5=019b326861e56508de2326f1351f4e08,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,417

In this study, we isolated and characterized an MsrB gene from Apis cerana cerana F., designated AccMsrB. The full cDNA of AccMsrB was 757 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 414 bp, and the predicted translation product was a 137 amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 15.5 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.77. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that AccMsrB shares high identity with other known MsrBs (Apis florea F., Apis mellifera L., Apis dorsata F., and Bombus terrestris L.) and contains conservative Cys residues. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed AccMsrB to be highly expressed in the epidermis of adult workers, reaching high levels in first-instar larvae, prepupae, and 15-d-old adults. Furthermore, the expression of AccMsrB was upregulated by various oxidative stresses, including 4, 16, 25, and 42 degrees C, ultraviolet light (30 mj/cm(2)), H2O2, CdCl2, HgCl2, paraquat, imidacloprid, and cyhalothrin.

360,JOUR,LD50 values may be misleading predictors of neonicotinoid toxicity across different bee species,"['Mayack, C.', 'Boff, S.']",Uludag Aricilik Dergisi,"The importance of not only honey bees (Apis mellifera) but also other non-managed bee species and their pollination services has come to light with their recently reported declines. One contributing factor in these declines is thought to be sub-lethal exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides such as thiacloprid. However, current government regulatory agencies do not require the assessment of insecticide toxicity on bee species other than the honey bee, even though previous studies have demonstrated that sensitivity to insecticides is not likely to be generalizable from honey bees to non-managed bee species. Replicating standardized protocols and testing five different doses of thiacloprid on individual caged bees, we assessed the acute contact toxicity by calculating mortality and the lethal dose (LD50) value for three bee species with different life history traits: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis. We found that Apis mellifera and Osmia bicomis had significantly higher mortality in comparison to Bombus terrestris, but there was no dose-dependent response for any of the three bee species. Bee size and sex were also not useful predictors of thiacloprid toxicity. These results suggest that solely relying on LD50 values, especially when they do not produce a dose-dependent response, may be misleading when assessing insecticide toxicity risk for honey bees and other non-managed bee species.

387,JOUR,Impact of Chronic Exposure to Two Neonicotinoids on Honey Bee Antennal Responses to Flower Volatiles and Pheromonal Compounds,"['Favaro, R.', 'Roved, J.', 'Haase, A.', 'Angeli, S.']",Frontiers in Insect Science,"Volatile compounds provide important olfactory cues for honey bees (Apis mellifera L.), which are essential for their ecology, behavior, and social communication. In the external environment bees locate food sources by the use of floral scents, while inside the hive, pheromones such as the queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) and alarm pheromones serve important functions in regulating colony life and inducing aggressive responses against intruders and parasites. Widely reported alterations of various behaviors in- and outside the hive following exposure to pesticides could therefore be associated with a disturbance of odor sensitivity. In the present study, we tested the effects of neonicotinoid pesticides at field concentrations on the ability of honey bees to perceive volatiles at the very periphery of the olfactory system. Bee colonies were subjected to treatments during the summer with either Imidacloprid or Thiacloprid at sublethal concentrations. Antennal responses to apple (Malus domestica L.) flower volatiles were studied by GC-coupled electro-antennographic detection (GC-EAD), and a range of volatiles, a substitute of the QMP, and the alarm pheromone 2-heptanone were tested by electroantennography (EAG). Short-term and long-term effects of the neonicotinoid treatments were investigated on bees collected in the autumn and again in the following spring. Treatment with Thiacloprid induced changes in antennal responses to specific flower VOCs, with differing short- and long-term effects. In the short term, increased antennal responses were observed for benzyl-alcohol and 1-hexanol, which are common flower volatiles but also constituents of the honey bee sting gland secretions. The treatment with Thiacloprid also affected antennal responses to the QMP and the mandibular alarm pheromone 2-heptanone. In the short term, a faster signal degeneration of the response signal to the positive control citral was recorded in the antennae of bees exposed to Thiacloprid or Imidacloprid. Finally, we observed season-related differences in the antennal responses to multiple VOCs. Altogether, our results suggest that volatile-specific alterations of antennal responses may contribute to explaining several behavioral changes previously observed in neonicotinoid-exposed bees. Treatment effects were generally more prominent in the short term, suggesting that adverse effects of neonicotinoid exposure may not persist across generations.

This study presents results of a three-year study working with 180 honey bee colonies in ten replicates. Colonies were sorted into three treatments (60 colonies per treatment) exposed to sunflower blooms grown from seeds treated with thiamethoxam, clothianidin and a non-treated control. Each colony was assessed at six moments: one before to exposition to sunflower, two during the exposition (short-time risk), two after exposition (medium-time risk) and one after wintering (long-time risk). The health and development of the colonies were assessed by monitoring adult bee population, brood development, status of the queen, food reserves and survival. No significant difference among treatments when raw data was considered. However, when evolution from initial status of the colony was evaluated, a significant difference was observed from the first week of exposure to sunflower blooms. In this period, the number of adult bees and the amount of brood were slightly lower in the bee hives exposed to neonicotinoids, although such differences disappeared in subsequent evaluations. The concentration of residues in samples of beebread and adult bees was at the level of ng¬∑g‚àí1. Magnitude of the effect of the treatment factor on the variability of colony health and development related parameters was low.

Therefore, our objective is the utilization of video-tracking to quantify how the acute oral exposure to different doses (0.1‚Äì2 ng/bee) of the neonicotinoid ‚Äúclothianidin‚Äù influences the locomotor activity of honeybees in a time course experiment. The total distance moved, resting time as well as the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down are measured. Our results show that bees exposed to acute sublethal doses of clothianidin exhibit a significant increase in the total distance moved after 30 and 60 min of the treatment at the highest dose (2 ng/bee). Nevertheless, a reduction of the total distance is observed at this dose 90 min post-treatment compared to the distance of the same group after 30 min, where the treated bees show an arched abdomen and start to lose their postural control. The treated bees with 1 ng clothianidin show a significant increase in total distance moved over the experimental period. Moreover, a reduction in the resting time and increase of the duration and frequency of bouts of laying upside down at these doses are found. Furthermore, significant effects on the tested parameters are observed at the dose (0.5 ng/bee) first at 60 min post-treatment compared to untreated bees. The lowest dose (0.1 ng/bee) has non-significant effects on the motor activity of honeybees compared to untreated bees over the experimental period. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.08.047,147,,200,205,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027974937&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2017.08.047&partnerID=40&md5=1d3554268e9f79afb053201c0286a8eb,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,422

Colony size is a key ecological trait predicted to drive sensitivity to environmental stressors and may be especially important for species with annual cycles of sociality, such as bumblebees. However, there is limited empirical evidence assessing the effect of colony size on sensitivity to environmental stressors or the mechanisms underlying these effects. Here, we examine the relationship between colony size and sensitivity to environmental stressors in bumblebees. We exposed colonies at different developmental stages briefly (2 days) to a common neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and cold stress, while quantifying behaviour of individuals. Combined imidacloprid and cold exposure had stronger effects on both thermoregulatory behaviour and long-term colony growth in small colonies. We find that imidacloprid's effects on behaviour are mediated by body temperature and spatial location within the nest, suggesting that social thermoregulation provides a buffering effect in large colonies. Finally, we demonstrate qualitatively similar effects in size-manipulated microcolonies, suggesting that group size per se, rather than colony age, drives these patterns. Our results provide evidence that colony size is critical in driving sensitivity to stressors and may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the complex and context-specific impacts of pesticide exposure.",2023/07/26/,2023,10.1098/rspb.2023.0555,290,2003,,,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'annual cycle', 'automated tracking', 'bee', 'bees', 'Bees', 'cold shock response', 'Cold-Shock Response', 'crop yield', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollution exposure', 'social behavior', 'social behaviour', 'temperature', 'temperature effect']",0962-8452,WOS:001032010300007,,0,,0,423

584,JOUR,The weakest link: Haploid honey bees are more susceptible to neonicotinoid insecticides,"['Friedli, A', 'Williams, GR', 'Bruckner, S', 'Neumann, P', 'Straub, L']",CHEMOSPHERE,"Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently of major concern for the health of wild and managed insects that provide key ecosystem services like pollination. Even though sublethal effects of neonicotinoids are well known, there is surprisingly little information on how they possibly impact developmental stability, and to what extent genetics are involved. This holds especially true for haploid individuals because they are hemizygous at detoxification loci and may be more susceptible. Here we take advantage of haplodiploidy in Western honey bees, Apis mellifera, to show for the first time that neonicotinoids affect developmental stability in diploid females (workers), and that haploid males (drones) are even more susceptible. Phenotypic fore wing venation abnormalities and fluctuating wing asymmetry, as measures of developmental instability, were significantly increased under field-realistic neonicotinoid-exposure of colonies. The higher susceptibility of haploid drones suggests that heterozygosity can play a key role in the ability to buffer the sublethal effects of neonicotinoids. Aiming to improve conservation efforts, our findings highlight the urgent need to better understand the role that genetics plays at enabling nontarget organisms to cope with insecticide exposure.

Linking our understanding of how pesticides affect individual bees to colony-level responses is challenging because colonies show emergent properties based on complex internal processes and interactions among individual bees. Agent-based models that simulate honey bee colony dynamics may be a tool for scaling between individual and colony effects of a pesticide. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are developing the VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide model, which simulates the dynamics of honey bee colonies and how they respond to multiple stressors, including weather, Varroa mites, and pesticides. To evaluate this model, we used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit field data from an empirical study where honey bee colonies were fed the insecticide clothianidin. This allowed us to reproduce colony feeding study data by simulating colony demography and mortality from ingestion of contaminated food. We found that VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide was able to fit general trends in colony population size and structure and reproduce colony declines from increasing clothianidin exposure. The model underestimated adverse effects at low exposure (36¬†¬µg/kg), however, and overestimated recovery at the highest exposure level (140¬†¬µg/kg), for the adult and pupa endpoints, suggesting that mechanisms besides oral toxicity-induced mortality may have played a role in colony declines. The VarroaPop¬†+¬†Pesticide model estimates an adult oral LD50 of 18.9¬†ng/bee (95% CI 10.1‚Äì32.6) based on the simulated feeding study data, which falls just above the 95% confidence intervals of values observed in laboratory toxicology studies on individual bees. Overall, our results demonstrate a novel method for analyzing colony-level data on pesticide effects on bees and making inferences on pesticide toxicity to individual bees. ¬© 2021 The Authors.

As such it is intrinsically toxic to insects and among them to the honey bee (Apis mellifera). An updated risk assessment is presented in the context of the regulatory evaluation of spinosad products and is in accordance with the latest recommendation of regulatory guidance documents. Results: The intrinsic toxicity to the honey bee as observed in laboratory conditions through oral and contact tests on adults does not appear to impair honey bee colonies when exposed to treated attractive crops in tunnel conditions. Reasons for this could include reduced availability of residues of the product on plant surface compared to laboratory conditions, together with a fast dissipation from treated plants and the absence of active degradation products. Conclusions: Spinosad products present a negligible impact on honey bees when used under the current label recommendations and conditions of agricultural use. This conclusion deduced from data available for the regulatory risk assessment has been confirmed by the feedback of surveys on incidents, which address the potential impact of spinosad products under realistic conditions of exposure, including other environmental and chemical factors that are common in cropped areas.",2012///,2012,10.5073/jka.2012.437.032,437,,107,114,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000393148200026,,0,,0,428

Declines in pollinator populations are thought to be due to multiple factors including habitat loss, climate change, increased vulnerability to disease and parasites, and pesticide use. Neonicotinoid pesticides are agonists of insect nicotinic cholinergic receptors, and sub-lethal exposures are linked to reduced honey bee hive survival. Honey bees are highly dependent on circadian clocks to regulate critical behaviors, such as foraging orientation and navigation, time-memory for food sources, sleep, and learning/memory processes. Because circadian clock neurons in insects receive light input through cholinergic signaling we tested for effects of neonicotinoids on honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep. Neonicotinoid ingestion by feeding over several days results in neonicotinoid accumulation in the bee brain, disrupts circadian rhythmicity in many individual bees, shifts the timing of behavioral circadian rhythms in bees that remain rhythmic, and impairs sleep. Neonicotinoids and light input act synergistically to disrupt bee circadian behavior, and neonicotinoids directly stimulate wake-promoting clock neurons in the fruit fly brain. Neonicotinoids disrupt honey bee circadian rhythms and sleep, likely by aberrant stimulation of clock neurons, to potentially impair honey bee navigation, time-memory, and social communication. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-72041-3,10,1,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85093829332&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-020-72041-3&partnerID=40&md5=a24ef869a003dc0e843503bf437dbbbc,Scopus,"['animal', 'animal behavior', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Behavior, Animal', 'circadian rhythm', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'drug effect', 'ecosystem', 'Ecosystem', 'honey', 'Honey', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'learning', 'Learning', 'memory', 'Memory', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nicotinic agent', 'Nicotinic Agonists', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'physiology', 'sleep', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Navigation', 'spatial orientation']",,0,,0,429

The study findings demonstrated that the impact of the topical application was low in all pesticides, while the other two methods led to 100% mortality after 48 hours at the recommended dose.

The relationship between lineages and the most prevalent pathogens (Nosema ceranae, Varroa destructor, trypanosomatids, Black Queen Cell Virus; and Deformed Wing Virus) was analysed with contingency tables, and the possible relationships between TUm and the prevalence of these pathogens were studied by using a factor analysis. The statistical analysis supported the associations between V. destructor and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV), and between N. ceranae and Black Queen Cell Virus (BQCV), but the association between these pathogens and trypanosomatids was not observed. TUm values varied between 5.5 √ó 10‚àí6 and 3.65 √ó 10‚àí1. When TUm < 3.35 √ó 10‚àí4, it was mainly determined by coumaphos, tau-fluvalinate and/or chlorfenvinphos.

Neonicotinoids can alter bee navigation, but we present the first evidence that neonicotinoid exposure alone can impair the physical ability of bees to fly. We tested the effects of acute or chronic exposure to thiamethoxam on the flight ability of foragers in flight mills. Within 1 h of consuming a single sublethal dose (1.34 ng/bee), foragers showed excitation and significantly increased flight duration (+78%) and distance (+72%). Chronic exposure significantly decreased flight duration (-54%), distance (-56%), and average velocity (-7%) after either one or two days of continuous exposure that resulted in bees ingesting field-relevant thiamethoxam doses of 1.96-2.90 ng/bee/day. These results provide the first demonstration that acute or chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid alone can significantly alter bee flight.

383,JOUR,Imidacloprid-induced facilitation of the proboscis extension reflex habituation in the honeybee,"['Lambin, M.', 'Armengaud, C.', 'Raymond, S.', 'Gauthier, M.']",Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology,"Imidacloprid is a new insecticide from the family of the neonicotinoids, which interact with the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The effects of imidacloprid at a dose that does not affect sensory or motor functions are studied on non-associative learning abilities in the honeybee. The behavioral procedure is the habituation of the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Imidacloprid topically applied on the thorax (1 Œºl) at the doses of 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee induces an increase of the gustatory threshold defined as the lowest concentration of a sucrose solution applied to the antennae able to elicit the PER. The ability of the honeybee to move in an open-field-like apparatus is impaired at the doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng/bee. These effects are amplified with time and reach a maximum 60 min after application. The lowest dose of 1.25 ng/bee has no effect on the gustatory function but increases the motor activity and facilitates the PER habituation independently of time. This result fits our hypothesis that a slight activation of the cholinergic system with a low dose of imidacloprid can facilitate a simple form of learning in the honeybee. Arch. Insect Biochem.

187,JOUR,Exposure to multiple cholinergic pesticides impairs olfactory learning and memory in honeybees,"['Williamson, S.M.', 'Wright, G.A.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Pesticides are important agricultural tools often used in combination to avoid resistance in target pest species, but there is growing concern that their widespread use contributes to the decline of pollinator populations. Pollinators perform sophisticated behaviours while foraging that require them to learn and remember floral traits associated with food, but we know relatively little about the way that combined exposure to multiple pesticides affects neural function and behaviour. The experiments reported here show that prolonged exposure to field-realistic concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitor coumaphos and their combination impairs olfactory learning and memory formation in the honeybee. Using a method for classical conditioning of proboscis extension, honeybees were trained in either a massed or spaced conditioning protocol to examine how these pesticides affected performance during learning and short- and long-term memory tasks. We found that bees exposed to imidacloprid, coumaphos, or a combination of these compounds, were less likely to express conditioned proboscis extension towards an odor associated with reward. Bees exposed to imidacloprid were less likely to form a long-term memory, whereas bees exposed to coumaphos were only less likely to respond during the short-term memory test after massed conditioning. Imidacloprid, coumaphos and a combination of the two compounds impaired the bees' ability to differentiate the conditioned odour from a novel odour during the memory test. Our results demonstrate that exposure to sublethal doses of combined cholinergic pesticides significantly impairs important behaviours involved in foraging, implying that pollinator population decline could be the result of a failure of neural function of bees exposed to pesticides in agricultural landscapes. ¬© 2013.

260,JOUR,Effects of neonicotinoid insecticide exposure and monofloral diet on nest-founding bumblebee queens,"['Leza, M.', 'Watrous, K.M.', 'Bratu, J.', 'Woodard, S.H.']",Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,"Bumblebees are among the world‚Äôs most important groups of pollinating insects in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Each spring, queen bumblebees emerge from overwintering and initiate new nests, which ultimately give rise to workers and new reproductives later in the season. Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We performed the first laboratory experiment with the model bumblebee species Bombus impatiens that explores how early nesting success is impacted by the effects of temporary or more sustained exposure to sublethal levels of a neonicotinoid-type insecticide (imidacloprid at 5 ppb in nectar) and by reliance on a monofloral pollen diet, two factors that have been previously implicated in bumblebee decline. We found that queens exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production. These findings speak to the sensitivity of queen bumblebees during the nest initiation phase of the colony cycle, with implications for how queens and their young nests are uniquely impacted by exposure to threats such as pesticide exposure and foraging habitat unsuitability. ¬© 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Two doses were used: D1=10 mu g PLL kg-l in syrup and 6 mu g AI kg(-1) in pollen; D2 was 2.5 times higher in syrup and 2.7 higher in pollen. During 85 days 27, 30 and 29 micro-colonies were reared for control, D1 and D2 treatments respectively. Food consumption was not affected by either dose. During the 5-day pre-oviposition period the mean insecticide intake was 4.8 ng per day per worker in treatment D2. Both doses slightly but significantly affected worker survival rate by 10% during the first month, without any dose-effect relationship. Brood production was significantly reduced in D1 treatment and larval ejection by workers was significantly lower in D1 and D2 than in control. No significant effect of D1 and D2 treatments on the duration of larval development was revealed. No residue could be detected in workers still alive after 85 days. It was concluded that the survival rate and reproductive capacity of B terrestris was not likely to be affected by prolonged ingestion of nectar produced by sunflower after seed-dressing treatment with imidacloprid (Gaucho), since honey or pollen collected by honeybees foraging treated sunflower never revealed concentrations of imidacloprid higher than 10 mu g kg(-1).

However, their survival has been threatened since the country has been standing out as a big consumer of pesticides. Many of the pesticides used are considered toxic to bees, including imidacloprid.

Co-exposure with other pesticides may also lead to detrimental synergistic effects.

Squash bees exposed to Quadris Top collected less pollen per flower visit, while Sivanto-exposed bees produced larger offspring. Pesticide co-exposure induced hyperactivity in female squash bees relative to both the control and single pesticide exposure, and reduced the number of emerging offspring per nest compared to individual pesticide treatments.

222,JOUR,Chronic impairment of bumblebee natural foraging behaviour induced by sublethal pesticide exposure,"['Gill, RJ', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"<list list-type=""1"" id=""fec12292-list-0001""> Insect pollination is a vital ecosystem service that maintains biodiversity and sustains agricultural crop yields. Social bees are essential insect pollinators, so it is concerning that their populations are in global decline. Although pesticide exposure has been implicated as a possible cause for bee declines, we currently have a limited understanding of the risk these chemicals pose. Whilst environmental exposure to pesticides typically has non-lethal effects on individual bees, recent reports suggest that sublethal exposure can affect important behavioural traits such as foraging. However, at present, we know comparatively little about how natural foraging behaviour is impaired and the relative impacts of acute and chronic effects. Using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging technology, we examined how the day-to-day foraging patterns of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were affected when exposed to either a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) and/or a pyrethroid (-cyhalothrin) independently and in combination over a four-week period. This is the first study to provide data on the impacts of combined and individual pesticide exposure on the temporal dynamics of foraging behaviour in the field over a prolonged period of time. Our results show that neonicotinoid exposure has both acute and chronic effects on overall foraging activity. Whilst foragers from control colonies improved their pollen foraging performance as they gained experience, the performance of bees exposed to imidacloprid became worse: chronic behavioural impairment. We also found evidence, suggesting that pesticide exposure can change forager preferences for the flower types from which they collect pollen. Our findings highlight the importance of considering prolonged exposure (which happens in the field) when assessing the risk that pesticides pose to bees. The effects of chronic pesticide exposure could have serious detrimental consequences for both colony survival and also the pollination services provided by these essential insect pollinators. <doi origin=""wiley"" registered=""yes"">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2435</doi",2014/12//,2014,10.1111/1365-2435.12292,28,6,1459,1471,,,,0269-8463,WOS:000344592000015,,0,,0,441

Honeybees were treated orally with 100 Œºg [14C]-acetamiprid kg-1 bee, a dose which is about 1500 times lower than the median lethal dose. After 72 h, only 40% of the total radioactivity was eliminated, suggesting that acetamiprid and its metabolites tended to persist in the honeybee. Acetamiprid was rapidly distributed in all compartments and metabolized. Just after administration, radioactivity was mainly localized in the abdomen and subsequently in the rectum. After 72 h, the maximum amount of radioactivity (about 20% of the ingested dose) was detected again in the abdomen, whereas the lowest level of total radioactivity was detected in the haemolymph. Radioactivity in the head did not exceed 7.6% of total ingested radioactivity. More than 50% of acetamiprid was metabolised in less than 30 min, indicating a very short half-life for the compound.

On the other side, dipel and pyridalyl recording the highest LC                             50                              and LC                             90                              at all tested periods and the highest LT                             50                              and LT                             90                              at all tested concentrations. As for the application of pesticides in cotton fields, the tested pesticides significantly increased the number of dead workers in comparison with control. The tested pesticides significantly decreased bee foraging activities, i.e., number of foraging workers, number of worker collecting nectar, number of worker gathering pollen grains, area of broad workers, and honey bee yields. Dipel and pyridalyl were the most safety pesticides on honey bee workers in laboratory and field, so it could be introduced as a component in IPM programs of cotton pests.                          ¬© 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019///,2019,10.1007/s11356-018-04061-6,26,5,4987,4996,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059673496&doi=10.1007%2fs11356-018-04061-6&partnerID=40&md5=d89014b4a6300d7f86c3e5135474e284,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,443

The presence of these P450s, belonging or closely related to the CYP9Q subfamily (CYP9Q-related), is generally well conserved across the diversity of bees. However, the alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata, lacks CYP9Q-related P450s and is 170‚Äì2500 times more sensitive to certain insecticides than bee pollinators with these P450s. The extent to which these findings apply to other Megachilidae bee species remains uncertain. To address this knowledge gap, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four Megachile species and leveraged the data obtained, in combination with publicly available genomic data, to investigate the evolution and function of P450s in the Megachilidae. Our analyses reveal that several Megachilidae species, belonging to the Lithurgini, Megachilini and Anthidini tribes, including all species of the Megachile genus investigated, lack CYP9Q-related genes. In place of these genes Megachile species have evolved phylogenetically distinct CYP9 genes, the CYP9DM lineage. Functional expression of these P450s from M. rotundata reveal they lack the capacity to metabolize the neonicotinoid insecticides thiacloprid and imidacloprid. In contrast, species from the Osmiini and Dioxyini tribes of Megachilidae have CYP9Q-related P450s belonging to the CYP9BU subfamily that are able to detoxify thiacloprid. These findings provide new insight into the evolution of P450s that act as key determinants of insecticide sensitivity in bees and have important applied implications for pesticide risk assessment. ¬© 2023 The Authors.

Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ‚â§ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ‚â§10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.125129,363,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207255876&doi=10.1016%2fj.envpol.2024.125129&partnerID=40&md5=8f2cab86958078b9f41ae5916477558a,,'current; Chronic test; Crop productivity; Flupyradifurone; Honey bee; Insect control; Insecticides; Long term exposure; Pesticide effects; Pesticides exposures; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks assessments; Syrup consumption; Time-reinforced toxicity; Time-reinforced toxicity (TRT); Toxicity,,0,,0,445

Concern about the consequent impact on bees makes it important to understand their resilience. In the laboratory, the authors therefore fed adult worker bees on dosed syrup (125 Œºg L-1 of imidacloprid, or 98 Œºg kg-1) either continuously or as a pulsed exposure and measured their behaviour (feeding and locomotory activity) and whole-body residues. RESULTS: On dosed syrup, honey bees maintained much lower bodily levels of imidacloprid than bumblebees (<0.2 ng versus 2.4 ng of imidacloprid per bee). Dietary imidacloprid did not affect the behaviour of honey bees, but it reduced feeding and locomotory activity in bumblebees. After the pulsed exposure, bumblebees cleared bodily imidacloprid after 48 h and recovered behaviourally. CONCLUSION: The differential behavioural resilience of the two species can be attributed to the observed differential in bodily residues. The ability of bumblebees to recover may be environmentally relevant in wild populations that face transitory exposures from the pulsed blooming of mass-flowering crops. ¬© 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.",2014///,2014,10.1002/ps.3569,70,2,332,337,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84892482969&doi=10.1002%2fps.3569&partnerID=40&md5=14d32ad468331b1ec5d0b122f0489294,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,446

Considering the potential threat of pesticide poisoning, the indigenous Saudi bee Apis mellifera jemenitica is susceptible to the risks associated with acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide. This study investigates the acetamiprid-induced effects on the survival, olfactory learning, and memory formation of A. m. jemenitica through two exposure routes: topical application and oral ingestion. Field-realistic and serially diluted concentrations (100, 50, 25, and 10 ppm) of acetamiprid led to notable mortality at 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after treatment, with peak mortality observed at 24 h and 48 h for both exposure routes. Bee mortality was concentration-dependent, increasing with the rising concentration of acetamiprid at the tested time intervals. Food consumption following oral exposure exhibited a concentration-dependent pattern, steadily decreasing with increasing concentrations of acetamiprid. Oral exposure resulted in a substantially higher cumulative mortality (55%) compared to topical exposure (15%), indicating a significant disparity in bee mortality between the two exposure routes. The 24 h post-treatment LC50 values for acetamiprid were 160.33 and 12.76 ppm for topical application and oral ingestion, respectively. The sublethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, and LC30) of acetamiprid were 15.23, 34.18, and 61.20 ppm, respectively, following topical exposure, and 2.85, 4.77, and 6.91 ppm, respectively, following oral exposure. The sublethal concentrations of acetamiprid significantly decreased learning during the 2nd‚Äì3rd conditioning trials and impaired memory formation at 2, 12, and 24 h following both topical and oral exposure routes, compared to the control bees. Notably, the sublethal concentrations were equally effective in impairing bee learning and memory. Taken together, acetamiprid exposure adversely affected bee survival, hindered learning, and impaired the memory retention of learned tasks. ¬© 2024 by the authors.",2024///,2024,10.3390/insects15070473,15,7,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85199863877&doi=10.3390%2finsects15070473&partnerID=40&md5=5904bd7c130a5053326e3c2a0133b7ad,Scopus,"['insecticide', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'pollution exposure', 'sublethal effect', 'honeybee', 'memory', 'toxicity', 'mortality', 'honey bee', 'cognitive skills', 'lethal toxicity', 'olfactory cue', 'oral routes', 'topical routes']",,,,0,,0,448

We found that exposure to clothianidin affected worker jelly production of individual workers and created a strong dose-dependent increase in mortality of individual larvae, but strikingly the population size of capped brood remained stable. Thus, hives exhibited short-term resilience. Using a demographic matrix model, we found that the basis of resilience in dosed colonies was a substantive increase in brood initiation rate to compensate for increased brood mortality. However, computer simulation of full size colonies revealed that the increase in brood initiation led to severe reductions in colony reproduction (swarming) and long-term survival.

Despite their importance in the process of fruit and seed production on crop sites, their activity may be impaired due to exposure to pesticides. This species has a yearly life cycle and colony success may rely on effective foraging of workers on ruderal plants late in summer when most crops are no longer flowering. In the current study, we investigated the effect of chronic exposure to Sulfoxaflor on aspects of the foraging behavior of bumble bees and whether Sulfoxaflor influences the body size of workers of B. terrestris in a crop landscape. We found that 2 weeks of continuous exposure to Sulfoxaflor influenced workers‚Äô foraging dynamics and collection of resources. However, there was no evidence that the 5 ppb dose of the pesticide impacted the ability of bees to handle flowers with different traits. Workers from colonies exposed to Sulfoxaflor were smaller. The effect on worker size may be explained as a consequence of the reduced pollen income per unit of worker foraging. Thus, if the effects of Sulfoxaflor applied directly to crops had the same effect as that observed on commercial bumble bees after our chronic exposure, it might negatively impact colony success due to the impact on pollen collection and the reduction in the size of workers.

Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, are widely regarded as a substantial contributing factor to the decline in bumblebee populations, as evidenced by the detrimental impacts documented across many stages of their life cycle. Mating is vital for the population maintenance of bumblebees. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of research conducted on the effects of pesticides on the mating process. In this study, we individually examined the impact of imidacloprid on the mating behavior of bumblebee males and queens. A competitive mating experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect on the competitive prowess of male individuals and the mate selection behavior of female individuals. The study revealed that the mating rate of bumblebees exposed to a concentration of 10 ppb of imidacloprid was 3 %. This finding demonstrated a statistically significant impact when compared to the control group, which exhibited a mating rate of 58 % in the normal mating experiment. Furthermore, in the competitive mating experiment, we found that the competitive mating success rate of treated males (1 %) was significantly lower than that of untreated males (35 %).

Neonicotinoids are the most commonly used insecticide globally, but restrictions on their use and rising pest resistance have increased the demand for alternative pesticides. Flupyradifurone is a novel insecticide that has been licenced globally for use on bee-visited crops. Here, in a semi-field experiment, we exposed solitary bees (Osmia lignaria) to a commercial pesticide formulation (Sivanto Prime) containing flupyradifurone at label-recommended rates. We originally designed the experiment to examine sublethal effects, but contrary to our expectations, 100 % of bees released into pesticide-treated cages died within 3 days of exposure, compared to 0 % in control plots. Bees exposed to flupyradifurone a few days after the initial application survived but endured prolonged sublethal effects, including lower nesting success, impairment to foraging efficiency, and higher mortality. These results demonstrate that exposure to this novel insecticide poses significant threats to solitary bees and add to a growing body of evidence indicating that this pesticide can have negative impacts on wild bees at field-realistic concentrations. In the short-term, we recommend that commercial formulations containing flupyradifurone should be restricted to non-flowering crops while a reassessment of its safety can be conducted.

The objective of this study was to test this hypothesis. Laboratory repeated dose toxicity tests on in vitro reared larvae were carried out using thiamethoxam. The repeated treatment median lethal concentration (LC50) and the median lethal dose (LD50) 14 and 19¬†days after grafting were calculated and resulted of the same order of magnitude of realistic brood exposure under a worst-case scenario.

This study investigated the neurotoxic responses of honeybee/cotton aphid nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to chiral dinotefuran at the enantiomeric scale and demonstrated the microscopic mechanism of species selectivity in nAChR-mediated enantioselective neurotoxicity. The findings indicated that ( S )-dinotefuran had a higher affinity for honeybee nAChR than ( R )-dinotefuran whereas both enantiomers exhibited similar bioactivity toward cotton aphid nAChR. The results of dynamic neurotoxic processes indicated the association of conformational changes induced by chiral dinotefuran with its macroscopic neurotoxicity, and ( R )-dinotefuran, which exhibit low toxicity to honeybee, was found to induce significant conformational changes in the enantioselective neurotoxic reaction, as supported by the average root -meansquare fluctuation (0.35 nm).

It is used in agriculture to control aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Toxicity studies have decreed its low toxicity to honeybees. However, recent research has challenged these claims; oral exposure to the pesticide can lead to behavioral abnormalities and in the worst cases, lethal phenomena. Compounds with antioxidant activity, such as flavonoids and polyphenols, have been shown to protect against the toxic effects of pesticides. The aim of this research was to evaluate the possible protective effect of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) against behavioral abnormalities and lethality induced by toxic doses of FLU orally administered to honeybees under laboratory conditions. Honeybees were assigned to experimental groups in which two toxic doses of FLU, 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L were administered. In other replicates, three doses (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg) of the bergamot polyphenolic fraction (BPF) were added to the above toxic doses. In the experimental groups intoxicated with FLU at the highest dose tested, all caged subjects (20 individuals) died within the second day of administration. The survival probability of the groups to which the BPF was added was compared to that of the groups to which only the toxic doses of FLU were administered. The mortality rate in the BPF groups was statistically lower (p < 0.05) than in the intoxicated groups; in addition, a lower percentage of individuals exhibited behavioral abnormalities. According to this research, the ingestion of the BPF attenuates the harmful effects of FLU.

However, honeybees are being threatened by highly effective pesticides such as neonicotinoids, which can have detrimental impacts on honeybee foraging in particular. In a colony, nectar and pollen foragers play distinct roles in sustaining the colony. Despite evidence of sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids on individual honeybees, little is known about how neonicotinoids affect the foraging behaviour of an entire colony. Here, we conducted a field study using our innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated monitoring technology to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid at field-realistic sub-lethal doses on colony foraging behaviour. A mechanistic simulation model (BEEHAVE) was then used to reproduce and interpret field observations, and further identify the plausible mechanisms underlying the empirical findings. Surprisingly, the field study revealed that imidacloprid greatly reduced pollen foraging but not nectar foraging. In addition, no lethal effects on honeybees were observed. The simulations showed that the time spent by pollen foragers on completing their foraging trips was significantly increased, which subsequently decreased the number of pollen foraging trips per day, thereby reducing pollen foraging at the colony level. This suggests that pollen and nectar foraging may require different energetic costs, cognitive functions, and/or gene expressions, which implies different susceptibilities of pollen and nectar foragers to chemical stressors. As pollen foraging is essential for brood rearing, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids, together with other stressors, may affect colony survival and resilience more than previously thought.",2024/06//,2024,10.1016/j.compag.2024.108966,221,,,,,,"['artificial intelligence', 'Automated monitoring', 'biomonitoring', 'Computational modelling', 'ecological impact', 'Ecology', 'Field studies', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Foraging trips', 'Gene expression', 'honeybee', 'Imidacloprids', 'Insecticides', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'numerical model', 'Oomen study', 'Pesticide risk assessment', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'simulation', 'Sub-lethal effects', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects']",0168-1699,WOS:001240235200001,,0,,0,460

Recently, we found that bees in a two-choice assay prefer to consume solutions containing field-relevant doses of the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid (IMD) and thiamethoxam (TMX), to sucrose alone. This suggests that neonicotinoids enhance the rewarding properties of sucrose and that low, acute doses could improve learning and memory in bees. To test this, we trained foraging-age honeybees to learn to associate floral scent with a reward containing nectar-relevant concentrations of IMD and TMX and tested their short (STM) and long-term (LTM) olfactory memories. Contrary to our predictions, we found that none of the solutions enhanced the rate of olfactory learning and some of them impaired it. In particular, the effect of 10 nM IMD was observed by the second conditioning trial and persisted 24 h later. In most other groups, exposure to IMD and TMX affected STM but not LTM. Our data show that negative impacts of low doses of IMD and TMX do not require long-term exposure and suggest that impacts of neonicotinoids on olfaction are greater than their effects on rewarding memories.",2015/10/19/,2015,10.1038/srep15322,5,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000362988900001,,0,,0,462

We found stronger effects on decision time and abnormal behaviors. TMX decreased bee decision times, a potential byproduct of induced hyperactivity since bees walked to make choices.

411,JOUR,A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist affects honey bee sucrose responsiveness and decreases waggle dancing,"['Eiri, D.M.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"A nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, imidacloprid, impairs memory formation in honey bees and has general effects on foraging. However, little is known about how this agonist affects two specific aspects of foraging: sucrose responsiveness (SR) and waggle dancing (which recruits nestmates). Using lab and field experiments, we tested the effect of sublethal doses of imidacloprid on (1) bee SR with the proboscis extension response assay, and (2) free-flying foragers visiting and dancing for a sucrose feeder. Bees that ingested imidacloprid (0.21 or 2.16 ng bee -1) had higher sucrose response thresholds 1 h after treatment. Foragers that ingested imidacloprid also produced significantly fewer waggle dance circuits (10.5- and 4.5-fold fewer for 50% and 30% sucrose solutions, respectively) 24 h after treatment as compared with controls. However, there was no significant effect of imidacloprid on the sucrose concentrations that foragers collected at a feeder 24 h after treatment. Thus, imidacloprid temporarily increased the minimum sucrose concentration that foragers would accept (short time scale, 1 h after treatment) and reduced waggle dancing (longer time scale, 24 h after treatment). The effect of time suggests different neurological effects of imidacloprid resulting from the parent compound and its metabolites. Waggle dancing can significantly increase colony food intake, and thus a sublethal dose (0.21 ng bee -1, 24 p.p.b.) of this commonly used pesticide may impair colony fitness. ¬© 2012 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",2012///,2012,10.1242/jeb.068718,215,12,2022,2029,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84862509996&doi=10.1242%2fjeb.068718&partnerID=40&md5=a49fa590d0ca066e31d284c615c955e3,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,465

Simulations from the model, parameterized using empirical data on bumblebee workers exposed to imidacloprid (a common neonicotinoid pesticide), suggest that colony size has significant effects on neonicotinoid-sensitivity within bumblebee nests. Specifically, differences are reduced between treated and untreated workers in larger colonies for several key aspects of behavior within nests.

Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides globally(3), but increasing evidence of negative impacts on important pollinators(4-9) and other non-target organisms(10) has led to legislative reassessment and created demand for the development of alternative products. Sulfoximine-based insecticides are the most likely successor(11), and are either licensed for use or under consideration for licensing in several worldwide markets(3), including within the European Union(12), where certain neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam) are now banned from agricultural use outside of permanent greenhouse structures. There is an urgent need to pre-emptively evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of sulfoximine-based pesticides on pollinators(11), because such effects are rarely detected by standard ecotoxicological assessments, but can have major impacts at larger ecological scales(13-15). Here we show that chronic exposure to the sulfoximine-based insecticide sulfoxaflor, at dosages consistent with potential post-spray field exposure, has severe sub-lethal effects on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies. Field-based colonies that were exposed to sulfoxaflor during the early growth phase produced significantly fewer workers than unexposed controls, and ultimately produced fewer reproductive offspring. Differences between the life-history trajectories of treated and control colonies first became apparent when individuals exposed as larvae began to emerge, suggesting that direct or indirect effects on a small cohort may have cumulative long-term consequences for colony fitness. Our results caution against the use of sulfoximines as a direct replacement for neonicotinoids.

Their development and survival were followed in parallel with control hives (unfed or fed with saccharose syrup) until the end of the following winter. The parameters followed were: adult bee activity (number of bee entering the hive and pollen carrying activity), adult bee population level, capped brood area, frequency of parasitic and other diseases, mortality, number of frames with brood after wintering and a global score of colonies after wintering. The only parameters linked to feeding with imidacloprid-supplemented saccharose syrup when compared with feeding with non-supplemented syrup were: a statistically non-significant higher activity index of adult bees, a significantly higher frequency of pollen carrying during the feeding period and a larger number of capped brood cells. When imidacloprid was no longer applied, activity and pollen carrying were re-established at a similar level for all groups. Repeated feeding with syrup supplemented with imidacloprid did not provoke any immediate or any delayed mortality before, during or following the next winter, whereas such severe effects are described by several French bee keepers as a consequence of imidacloprid use for seed dressing in neighbouring cultures. In any case, during the whole study, mortality was very low in all groups, with no difference between imidacloprid-fed and control colonies. Further research should now address several hypotheses: the troubles described by bee keepers have causes other than imidacloprid; if such troubles are really due to this insecticide, they may only be observed either when bees consume contaminated pollen, when no other sources of food are available, in the presence of synergic factors (that still need to be identified), with some particular races of bees or when colonies are not strong and healthy. ¬© 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.",2005///,2005,10.1002/ps.957,61,2,111,125,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-12244262801&doi=10.1002%2fps.957&partnerID=40&md5=be7454ddad9097857bff1c5edfe9b218,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,470

Honeybees were treated orally with imidacloprid at 20 and 50 Œºg kg-1 bee. Imidacloprid was metabolised relatively quickly and thoroughly. Twenty minutes after the beginning of imidacloprid ingestion, the sum of the residues from the three compounds amounted to only 70% of the actual given dose. Imidacloprid, 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin represented, respectively, 50%, 9% and 8% of the actual ingested dose. Six and 24h, respectively, after ingestion of imidacloprid at 20 and 50 Œºg kg -1 bee, imidacloprid could no longer be detected in the honeybee. Imidacloprid had a half-life ranging between 4.5 and 5h and was rapidly metabolised into 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and olefin. Except 5-hydroxyimidacloprid in the 20 Œºg kg-1 treatment, these two metabolites presented a peak value 4h after ingestion of the 20 and 50 Œºg kg-1 doses. This time fully coincided with the appearance of mortality induced by imidacloprid after acute oral intoxication. These results suggested that the immediate neurotoxicity symptoms are due to the action of imidacloprid, whereas 5-hydroxyimidacloprid and/or olefin are involved in honeybee mortality. In addition, it was likely that the 30% of residues undetected 20min after intoxication were imidacloprid metabolites, although not 5-hydroxyimidacloprid or olefin. Thus, 5-hydroxyirnidacloprid and olefin could not be the major metabolites in the worker bees. ¬© 2003 Society of Chemical Industry.",2004///,2004,10.1002/ps.772,60,3,,,291,296,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-1442327234&doi=10.1002%2fps.772&partnerID=40&md5=8892af9145c8cc4f6ffb537b2ddcab88,Scopus,,,0,,0,471

To explore how trace levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid impacted colony foraging performance, we equipped bees with RFID tags that allowed us to track their lifetime flight behavior. One group of bees was exposed to a trace concentration (5 Œºg/kg, ppb) of imidacloprid in sugar syrup while in the larval stage. The imidacloprid residues caused bees to start foraging when younger as adults and perform fewer orientation flights, and reduced their lifetime foraging flights by 28%. The magnitude of the effects of a trace imidacloprid concentration delivered only during larval stage highlights the severity of pesticide residues for bee foraging performance. Our data suggest that neonicotinoids could impact colony function by imbalancing the normal age based division of labor in a colony and reducing foraging efficiency. Understanding this mechanism will help the development of interventions to safeguard bee colony health. ¬© 2019 American Chemical Society.",2019///,2019,10.1021/acs.est.9b02452,53,14,8252,8261,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069947948&doi=10.1021%2facs.est.9b02452&partnerID=40&md5=3b7cb59eb919bb47a892caadf72b6859,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,472

The standard treatment of imidacloprid gave significantly better control than azadirachtin of one pest (cucumber beetle) early in the season.

However, pesticide application is still recognized as one of the main stress factors causing a decline in the global population of bees. In all ERA procedures, the effects of pesticides on the honey bee species Apis mellifera are used as a reference for the effects on all different bee species. To evaluate if tropical native bees are protected by the current risk assessment procedures and to propose improvements to the methods, we assessed the ecological risk of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid posed to native and exotic bee species. The risk was assessed through a low (TIER I) and an intermediate (TIER II) level of analysis. For TIER I the USEPA BeeREX model was used and for TIER II the Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) approach was adopted. For the imidacloprid exposure conditions, four different crops were taken into consideration; bean, passion fruit, sunflower and tomato. The imidacloprid risk on native species was assessed both by extrapolating the effects obtained to Apis species, and by using ecotoxicological data from tests performed with native species. In TIER I, the risks calculated through empirical data showed that more than 50% of the non-Apis species presented risk levels of 28‚Äì180% higher than those obtained with the extrapolation factor used in the Brazilian pesticide regulation. In TIER II, the SSDs showed that most of the native bees are more sensitive to imidacloprid than the Africanized A. mellifera. This is the first study in which an ERA of a pesticide was conducted on tropical bee species. Here we also present some gaps and perspectives for future studies aiming to improve the risk assessment of pesticides in terrestrial environments. ¬© 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envres.2022.113127,212,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126866576&doi=10.1016%2fj.envres.2022.113127&partnerID=40&md5=a06459446fbc7f9b2b077adf6aedaa61,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'pollinator', 'Article', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'plant seed', 'pollen', 'risk assessment', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'pesticide residue', 'nectar', 'Neonicotinoid', 'LD50', 'Pollinators', 'Brazil', 'pesticide application', 'population decline', 'ecotoxicity', 'environmental risk', 'model', 'sunflower', 'native species', 'Native species', 'tomato', 'Risk quotient', 'calculation', 'BeeREX model', 'bean', 'Brazilian bees', 'passion fruit', 'SSD curve']",,,,0,,0,475

Recent studies have suggested that pesticides may significantly impact bumblebee colonies - an important and declining group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to thiamethoxam caused a 26% reduction in the proportion of queens that laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26% reduction in colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have significant impacts on population dynamics. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).",2017///,2017,10.1038/s41559-017-0260-1,1,9,1308,1316,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027489115&doi=10.1038%2fs41559-017-0260-1&partnerID=40&md5=8d50cc8b91f5148c06906693418c5ee6,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,476

Yet, such effects may vary between pesticides, dosage, application timing and pollinator assemblage in the study area. Understanding such diversity of effects is essential to enable integrated pest management practices that minimize negative impacts on pollinators. Here, we use a controlled experiment to compare different strategies of pesticide application in tomato crops: no application, low-intensity applications (every 7 days) and high-intensity application (every 3-4 days) with the last being the usual practice used by farmers in the study region. We focus on imidacloprid that is a neonicotinoid insecticide commonly used in Brazil. We show the negative effects of imidacloprid on the pollinator visitation rate of tomato flowers varied between flower visitor species. While the bee Paratrigona lineata was negatively affected by the imidacloprid application, no effects were detected when analysing all other bees as a group, indicating a null net effect. Although some studies have shown this insecticide is extremely harmful to bees' health, others showed that some bees do not avoid it, which may explain our results. However, the visitation rate recovery for P. lineata was only detected in the less than the more intensive treatment after imidacloprid applications ceased. The fact that no differences in fruit production were detected between treatments (including control blocks) could result from a null net effect of the negative effects on pollinators and positive effects on pest control.

However, its effect on beneficial insects such as the honeybee Apis mellifera L is still controversial. As young adult workers perform in-hive duties that are crucial for colony maintenance and survival, we aimed to assess the effect of sublethal IMI doses on honeybee behaviour during this period. Also, because this insecticide acts as a cholinergic-nicotinic agonist and these pathways take part in insect learning and memory processes; we used IMI to assess their role and the changes they suffer along early adulthood. We focused on appetitive behaviours based on the proboscis extension response. Laboratory reared adults of 2 to 10 days of age were exposed to sublethal IMI doses (0.25 or 0.50ng) administered orally or topically prior to behavioural assessment. Modification of gustatory responsiveness and impairment of learning and memory were found as a result of IMI exposure. These outcomes differed depending on age of evaluation, type of exposure and IMI dose, being the youngest bees more sensitive and the highest oral dose more toxic. Altogether, these results imply that IMI administered at levels found in agroecosystems can reduce sensitivity to reward and impair associative learning in young honeybees. Therefore, once a nectar inflow with IMI traces is distributed within the hive, it could impair in-door duties with negative consequences on colony performance.",2015/10/21/,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0140814,10,10,,,,,,1932-6203,WOS:000363248400070,,0,,0,478

The economic contribution of the insect‚Äôs pollinators to world agriculture is estimated at billions of dollars. However, non-judicious choice of pesticides and absence of good plant protection practices, represent a real danger to bees. The objective of this study was to assess the toxicity of three insecticides commonly used in cotton protection on bees Apis mellifera adansonii in Benin. Materials and Methods: In this context, bees were taken from hives and transported to the laboratory. Active ingredients and different doses used were as followed: Emamectin benzoate, beta-cyfluthrin+imidacloprid and lamdex+chlorpyrifos at doses of: 2150 nanograms per bee, 125 nanograms per bee, 75, 50, 25, 12.5√ó103, 6, 2.5 and 1.25-0.96 ng per bee, depending on the active ingredient. Each treatment included three replications consisting of 25 bees. Bees were anaesthetized with ether before treatment. Each bee received by topical application on the pronotum, 1 ŒºL of the formulation. Results: Observations were made after 2, 10, 24 and 48 h. Results indicated that, even the lowest doses of the pesticides: 0.96, 7.25 and 21.5 ng per b showed mortality higher than 90% to bees, 48 h after application. An insecticide with active ingredients including beta-cyfluthrin (45 g L‚Äì1), which is a pyrethroid and Imidacloprid (100 g L‚Äì1), a neonicotinoid actually forbidden in many European countries showed very high toxicity to honey bees, indicating values of the LD50 varying from 19.9 ng per bee for 10 h exposure to 1.1√ó10‚Äì2 ng per bee for 18 h and 5√ó10‚Äì4 ng per bee for 36 h. Conclusion: Results of the study indicated the urgent need of good plant protection practices in the frame of sustainable agriculture and bee‚Äôs preservation and conservation. Promotion of strategies as part of the dissemination of good agricultural practices in plant protection is a guarantee which should ensure sustainable agriculture and environmental, human and biodiversity protection.

One of the main anthropogenic drivers is the massive use of pesticides in agriculture. Risk assessment procedures test pesticides for mortality rates of well-fed, parasite free individuals of a few non-target species. Sublethal and synergistic effects of co-occurring stressors are usually not addressed. Here, we present a simple, wildly applicable bio-essay to assess such effects. Using brood thermoregulation in bumblebee microcolonies as readout, we investigate how this collective ability is affected by long-term feeding exposure to the herbicide glyphosate (5 mg/l), the insecticide flupyradifurone (0.4 mg/l) and the combination of both, when co-occurring with the natural stressor of resource limitation. Documenting brood temperature and development in 53 microcolonies we find no significant effect of glyphosate, while flupyradifurone significantly impaired the collective ability to maintain the necessary brood temperatures, resulting in prolonged developmental times and a decrease in colony growth by over 50 %. This reduction in colony growth has the potential to significantly curtail the reproductive chances of colonies in the field. Our findings highlight the potentially devastating consequences of flupyradifurone use in agriculture even at sub-lethal doses and underline the urgent need for improved risk assessment procedures. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166097,903,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85168103283&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.166097&partnerID=40&md5=71fd9fafbe9b7749bcfa557154545900,,agriculture; Agriculture; animal experiment; animal parameters; animal tissue; anthropogenic effect; Anthropogenics; Apis; Article; Assessment procedure; bee; Bombus terrestris; Brood development; brood temperature; bumblebee; collective brood care; Collective thermoregulation; colony growth; Colony growth; controlled study; dietary exposure; flupyradifurone; glyphosate; herbicide; Herbicides; insecticide; Insecticides; Microcolonies; Mortality rate; nonhuman; organism colony; Parasite-; pesticide; Pesticides; Pollinator crisis; risk assessment; Risk assessment; Risks assessments; temperature; thermoregulation; unclassified drug,,0,,0,480

Here, we assessed whether a field-realistic concentration of flupyradifurone, a novel pesticide that has been labelled as 'bee safe' by regulators, influenced bumblebee sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory. In a fully crossed experimental design, we exposed individual bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to flupyradifurone at high (50% (w/w)) or low (15% (w/w)) sucrose concentrations, replicating diets that are either carbohydrate rich or poor, respectively. We found that flupyradifurone impaired sucrose responsiveness and long-term memory at both sucrose concentrations, indicating that better nutrition did not buffer the negative impact of flupyradifurone. We found no individual impact of sugar deficiency on bee behaviour and no significant interactions between pesticide exposure and poor nutrition. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that flupyradifurone has significant negative impacts on pollinators, indicating that this pesticide is not 'bee safe'.

Safer alternatives as the spinosad-based formulation GF-120 have been developed to overcome this issue. Though both the low concentration of spinosad and the ultra-low-volume application rate of GF-120 are supposed to have a low acute toxicity in honey bee foragers, to our knowledge such claims have not been explicitly proven. We thus carried out a series of experiments to assess the effect of GF-120, malathion, and Spintor (spinosad) on honey bee foragers when applied at two concentrations (80 and 1,500 ppm) and two application rates (low density rate [LDR]-80 drops of 5 mm diameter per square meter; high density rate [HDR]-thousands of 200 -A mu m-diameter droplets per square meter). Interestingly, the three pesticides caused low mortality on foragers when applied at LDR-80, LDR-1,500, or HDR-80. However, HDR-1,500 caused a very high mortality. Based upon these results, we developed a computer program to estimate the average number of foragers that are exposed at LDR and HDR. We found that more foragers receive a lethal dose when exposed at HDR than at the other rates.

The homing ability was assessed by the catch-and-release method, the flight ability was assessed by flight mills, and the learning acquisition and short-term retention were evaluated by the proboscis extension response method. Results: When treated with 10¬†ppb of TMX, bees had a significantly higher average homing time, mean flight velocity, flying distance, and flying duration than the control, whereas 2.4¬†ppb concentration did not cause any significant effect on homing or flight ability. Bees treated with either 2.4¬†ppb or 10¬†ppb TMX had significantly lower learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Conclusion: Results suggest that acute oral exposure to 10¬†ppb of TMX altered the short-distance homing time, flight ability, and learning acquisition and short-term retention ability. Our study also highlights the concern that acute oral exposure to a low concentration of 2.4¬†ppb could have consequences on the behavior of A. creana. Those multiple sublethal alterations on A. cerana's behavior indicate that TMX are likely having complex but negative consequences on bee health in the field. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. ¬© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry",2019///,2019,10.1002/ps.5411,75,11,2975,2980,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064516748&doi=10.1002%2fps.5411&partnerID=40&md5=fb50bea67c4838daacf8283300adb9f9,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,483

Highest amounts of clothianidin residues were measured in single samples of mud cell walls (7.2 mu g kg(-1)) and pollen (5.9 mu g kg(-1)) from solitary bee nests. Residues in nectar from honey sacs, honeybee combs and bumblebee nests (2.2, 2.9, and 3.0 mu g kg(-1) respectively) showed no clear differences in the amount of residues, neither did residues in pollen (1.5, 1.8, and 1.3 mu g kg(-1) respectively). These results suggest differences in the risk profiles of those three bee species.",2015///,2015,,450,,155,158,,,,1868-9892,WOS:000381782400027,,0,,0,484

For social bees, communication is important for both the individual and the development of the colony. Successful communication helps bees to recognize relatives, defend the colony, and promote recruitment to optimize foraging of floral-resources. Bees' contribution to pollination is of broad environmental and economic importance. However, studies have reported that anthropogenic actions, such as the use of pesticides, negatively affect bee survival and behavior. We tested the effect of a commercially available pesticide mix containing two pesticide classes, a neonicotinoid and a pyrethroid, on the social behavior of the stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata (Lepeletier, 1863). After determining a sublethal dose of the pesticides, we tested the effect of an acute dose on antennation and trophallaxis behaviors of worker bees.

The aim of this study was to know the acute lethal toxicity of acetamiprid, malathion, phosmet and spinosad insecticides on P. emerina and T. fiebrigi. We obtained the mean concentration and mean lethal dose (LC50 and LD50) and the mean survival of workers after oral and topical exposure to insecticides, respectively. The LC50 values (ng a.i./Œºl of diet) and the decreasing order of toxicity for P. emerina was spinosad (4.96) > malathion (18.75) > phosmet (97.33) > acetamiprid (4204.06), and for T. fiebrigi also was spinosad (5.65) > malathion (8.39) > phosmet (53.91) > acetamiprid (9841.32), when orally exposed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact that simultaneous exposure to DMT and FLU doses has on bee health. Groups of twenty honeybees were housed in cages to compose six macro-groups. One group consisted of experimental replicates treated orally with a toxic dose of deltamenthrin (DMT 21.6 mg/L); two other groups were subjected to the oral administration of two toxic doses of flupyradifurone (FLU 50 mg/L and FLU 100 mg/L); and two other groups were intoxicated with a combination of the two pesticides (DMT 21.6 + FLU 50 and DMT 21.6 + FLU 100). The consequences of the pesticides‚Äô interactions were highlighted by measuring and comparing data on survival, food consumption, and abnormal behavior. Generally speaking, antagonism between the two pesticides has been demonstrated. The bees were able to survive for up to three days at the lowest dosage of FLU (50 mg/L), with 46% of the subjects still alive; however, the maximum dose (100 mg/L) caused all treated animals to die as early as the second day. When DMT and FLU 50 were administered together, the group that received DMT alone had a lower survival rate. When comparing the survival rates produced by the DMT and FLU 50 combination to those of the group receiving FLU 50 alone, the same was clearly visible. While there was no statistically significant improvement observed when the survival indices of the DMT and FLU 100 combination were compared to those of the group intoxicated with DMT alone, an improvement in survival indices was observed when these were compared with the group intoxicated with FLU 100 alone. ¬© 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024,10.3390/ani14060851,14,6,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188842192&doi=10.3390%2fani14060851&partnerID=40&md5=daea9e86a4f794dca079f939b6438c45,,abnormal behavior; adult; animal experiment; animal health and welfare; animal model; antagonism; antagonistic effect; Article; beekeeping; deltamethrin; drug interaction; environment; flupyradifurone; food intake; honeybee; honeybee (Apis mellifera); in vitro study; intoxication; nonhuman; pest control; pesticide; pesticides; plant pest control; plants; survival rate; unclassified drug,,0,,0,487

Evaluating the exposure and responses of different bee species to plant protection products is considered an essential part of their risk assessment. This study was conducted to assess the impacts of thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on buff-tailed bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) in a worst-case scenario under semi-field conditions. Bumblebee colonies or solitary bee trap nests were confined in tunnels with flowering oilseed rape. The recommended maximum application rates of 72 g thiacloprid/ha and 675 g prochloraz/ha were applied as a tank mixture during bee flight in full flowering oilseed rape. Several parameters such as flight and foraging activity, population parameters, and exposure level were investigated. Our results show adverse effects of the combination of thiacloprid and prochloraz on the reproductive performance of red mason bees. The number of cocoons produced by O. bicornis was significantly reduced in the treatment compared to the control group. Regarding bumblebees, we found no effects of the thiacloprid-prochloraz mixture on any observed parameters of colony development. The maximum detected concentrations of both active substances three days after application were higher in O. bicornis pollen mass compared to B. terrestris stored pollen. We conclude that this worst-case scenario of thiacloprid-prochloraz exposure poses a high risk to solitary bees and thus the use of such mixture should be restricted. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).",2020///,2020,10.1007/s10646-020-02223-2,29,7,846,855,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084840541&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-020-02223-2&partnerID=40&md5=0f41b208fd9e7ef5177bd48f7e906318,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'flight behavior', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'animal experiment', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'foraging behavior', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicornis', 'risk assessment', 'Apoidea', 'drug effect', 'environmental exposure', 'feeding behavior', 'Feeding Behavior', 'flying', 'flight', 'comparative study', 'organism colony', 'reproduction', 'colony', 'priority journal', 'male', 'Bombus terrestris', 'thiacloprid', 'Bumblebees', 'Reproduction', 'Thiacloprid', 'Flight, Animal', 'thiazine derivative', 'Thiazines', 'Osmia', 'population dynamics', 'Population Dynamics', 'imidazole derivative', 'Imidazoles', 'rapeseed', 'species difference', 'Brassica napus', 'prochloraz', 'Germany', 'cocoon', 'Exposure', 'reproductive toxicity', 'interspecific variation', 'Osmia rufa', 'Prochloraz', 'Red mason bees']",,,,0,,0,488

The results showed that the effects varied significantly according to the pesticide, type of exposure (oral or topical), and bee species. Through oral exposure,M. quadrifasciatawas more susceptible to all insecticides except for abamectin, while in topical exposure,T. fiebrigiwas more sensitive. Thiamethoxam followed by spinetoram and abamectin were the most lethal, regardless of species or exposure route; novaluron was not harmful at the highest tested dose. The locomotor activity of bees was altered in the presence of sublethal doses (LC(10)and LC50) of all insecticides. Spinetoram and abamectin can be as much as toxic as thiamethoxam againstM. quadrifasciataandT. fiebrigiin laboratory experiments.

Trigona spinipes populations can be negatively impacted by insecticides commonly used for pest control in crops. However, this species has been neglected in toxicological studies. Here we observed the effects of seven insecticides on the survival of bees that had fed directly on insecticide-contaminated food sources or received insecticides via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates. The effects of insecticides on flight behavior were also determined for the compounds considered to be of low toxicity. RESULTS: Imidacloprid, spinosad and malathion were categorized as highly toxic to T. spinipes, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin, methomyl and chlorfenapyr were of medium to low toxicity and interfered with two aspects of flight behavior evaluated here. Chlorantraniliprole was the only insecticide tested here that had no significant effect on T. spinipes survival, although it did interfere with one aspect of flight capacity. A single bee that had ingested malathion, spinosad or imidacloprid, could contaminate three, four and nineteen other bees, respectively via trophallaxis, resulting in the death of the recipients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to evaluate the ecotoxicology of a range of insecticides that not only negatively affected T. spinipes survival, but also interfered with flight capacity, a very important aspect of pollination behavior. The toxicity of the insecticides was observed following direct ingestion and also via trophallactic exchanges between nestmates, highlighting the possibility of lethal effects of these insecticides spreading throughout the colony, reducing the survival of non-foraging individuals.

The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and LD50 values of the chronic toxicity tests for each insecticide were 0.00512 and 0.064 Œºg larva‚àí1 for CYA, and 0.0625 Œºg larva‚àí1 and 0.212 Œºg larva‚àí1 for SUL, respectively. Larvae chronically exposed to SUL emerged as bees with deformed wings, reaching adult deformation rates of over 50%; however, CYA had no effect on adult deformation. CONCLUSION: Exposure to CYA increased larval mortality but did not cause any adult deformation, whereas SUL exposure increased pupal mortality and caused wing deformation in newly emerged bees.

Intensive use of plant protection products is one key factor contributing to this decline. Especially the mixture of different plant protection products can pose an increased risk for pollinators as synergistic effects may occur. In this study we investigated the effect of the fungicide Cantus¬Æ Gold (boscalid/dimoxystrobin), the neonicotinoid insecticide Mospilan¬Æ (acetamiprid) and their mixture on honeybees. Since both plant protection products are frequently applied sequentially to the same plants (e.g. oilseed rape), their combination is a realistic scenario for honeybees. We investigated the mortality, the sucrose responsiveness and the differential olfactory learning performance of honeybees under controlled conditions in the laboratory to reduce environmental noise. Intact sucrose responsiveness and learning performance are of pivotal importance for the survival of individual honeybees as well as for the functioning of the entire colony. Treatment with two sublethal and field relevant concentrations of each plant protection product did not lead to any significant effects on these behaviors but affected the mortality rate. However, our study cannot exclude possible negative sublethal effects of these substances in higher concentrations. In addition, the honeybee seems to be quite robust when it comes to effects of plant protection products, while wild bees might be more sensitive. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114850,256,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85151449855&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2023.114850&partnerID=40&md5=a4543218cf5c3c02e16cd36104e44456,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'acetamiprid', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'nonhuman', 'pesticide', 'sublethal effect', 'Apis mellifera', 'honeybee', 'learning', 'sucrose', 'concentration (composition)', 'Insecticide', 'mortality', 'Sucrose', 'environmental factor', 'odor', 'unclassified drug', 'LD50', 'fungicide', 'LC50', 'Sublethal effect', 'Synergistic effect', '2-chloro-N-(4-chlorobiphenyl-2-yl)nicotinamide', 'dimoxystrobin', 'frequency analysis', 'Fungicides, Industrial', 'mortality rate', 'noise', 'Non-SBI fungicide', 'Pesticide mixture', 'synergistic effect']",,,,0,,0,492

In addition to well-documented direct impacts of pesticides at the current stage or time, potential delayed ‚Äúcarryover‚Äù effects from past exposure at a different life stage may augment impacts on individuals and populations. We investigated the effects of current exposure and the carryover effects of past insecticide exposure on the individual vital rates and population growth of the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. Bees in flight cages freely foraged on wildflowers, some treated with the common insecticide, imidacloprid, in a fully crossed design over 2 y, with insecticide exposure or no exposure in each year. Insecticide exposure directly to foraging adults and via carryover effects from past exposure reduced reproduction. Repeated exposure across 2 y additively impaired individual performance, leading to a nearly fourfold reduction in bee population growth. Exposure to even a single insecticide application can have persistent effects on vital rates and can reduce population growth for multiple generations. Carryover effects had profound implications for population persistence and must be considered in risk assessment, conservation, and management decisions for pollinators to mitigate the effects of insecticide exposure. ¬© 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

521,JOUR,Examination of mass honey bee death at the entrance to hives in a paddy rice production district in Japan: The influence of insecticides sprayed on nearby rice fields,"['Kimura, K.', 'Yoshiyama, M.', 'Saiou, K.', 'Nirasawa, K.', 'Ishizaka, M.']",Journal of Apicultural Research,"Beekeepers in Japan have been finding as many as 1,000 dead honey bees piled up in front of hive entrances. They have observed that these mass bee deaths tend to occur at about the same time as measures are taken to control rice bugs, which appear every year during the summer in rice-producing districts. We set up and conducted controlled field studies from July to August in 2012 in a rice-producing district of northern Japan where frequent mass bee deaths are observed each summer. As had occurred in the area in previous years, and as we directly observed during our field investigations, masses of honey bees were found dead at the entrance to their hives. Samples of pollen and honey bee corpses were found to contain measurable concentrations of five active ingredients of insecticides: clothianidin, dinotefuran, ethiprole, etofenprox, and phenthoate. Insecticides containing these active ingredients are known to have been used for rice bug control in this area. Furthermore, we did not observe other known honey bee death agents in the area, such as mites and hornets. Thus, we suspected that the phenomenon of ""piled honey bee death"" (PD) at hive entrances is related to the influence of insecticides used to control rice bugs in paddies. The insecticide concentrations in dead honey bees were, however, extremely low compared with the median lethal dose (LD50) for honey bees. Moreover, PD was observed after rice anthesis, when bees would be collecting pollen from flowering plants other than rice. This calls into question any direct link between mass bee death and insecticides. Further study is necessary to understand insecticide exposure routes and the actual mechanism of the PD phenomenon. ¬© IBRA 2014",2014///,2014,10.3896/IBRA.1.53.5.12,53,5,,,599,606,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84920153258&doi=10.3896%2fIBRA.1.53.5.12&partnerID=40&md5=ba4eacfa3b5fbbadcfd183d8440f1dd9,Scopus,,,0,,0,494
467,JOUR,Field agrochemical exposure impacts locomotor activity in wild bumblebees,"['Strang, CG', 'Rondeau, S', 'Baert, N', 'Mcart, SH', 'Raine, NE', 'Muth, F']",ECOLOGY,"Agricultural intensification has been identified as one of the key causes of global insect biodiversity losses. These losses have been further linked to the widespread use of agrochemicals associated with modern agricultural practices. Many of these chemicals are known to have negative sublethal effects on commercial pollinators, such as managed honeybees and bumblebees, but less is known about the impacts on wild bees. Laboratory-based studies with commercial pollinators have consistently shown that pesticide exposure can impact bee behavior, with cascading effects on foraging performance, reproductive success, and pollination services. However, these studies typically assess only one chemical, neglecting the complexity of real-world exposure to multiple agrochemicals and other stressors. In the summer of 2020, we collected wild-foraging workers of the common eastern bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, from five squash (Cucurbita) agricultural sites (organic and conventional farms), selected to represent a range of agrochemical, including neonicotinoid insecticide, use. For each bee, we measured two behaviors relevant to foraging success and previously shown to be impacted by pesticide exposure: sucrose responsiveness and locomotor activity. Following behavioral testing, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) chemical analysis to detect and quantify the presence of 92 agrochemicals in each bumblebee. Bees collected from our sites did not vary in pesticide exposure as expected. While we found a limited occurrence of neonicotinoids, two fungicides (azoxystrobin and difenoconazole) were detected at all sites, and the pesticide synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was present in all 123 bees. We found that bumblebees that contained higher levels of PBO were less active, and this effect was stronger for larger bumblebee workers.

256,JOUR,Bumblebees Exposed to a Neonicotinoid Pesticide Make Suboptimal Foraging Decisions,"['Siviter, H.', 'Johnson, A.K.', 'Muth, F.']",Environmental Entomology,"Bumblebees are important pollinators of agricultural crops and wildflowers, but many species are in decline. Neonicotinoid insecticides are the most commonly used insecticide globally and can have negative sublethal effects on bumblebee colony growth and reproduction. Individual bumblebees can visit hundreds to thousands of flowers a day to forage for their colony. As such, they are a model species for studying optimal foraging, and small impairments to an individual's foraging decisions may have compounding effects on the colony's nutritional intake. We exposed bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to an acute, field-realistic dose of the neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid, before allowing them to forage on an artificial floral array. We found that neonicotinoid-exposed bumblebees made suboptimal foraging decisions, as they were more likely to visit flowers located further apart than control bees. This indicates that for a given flower patch, individual bees exposed to a neonicotinoid will likely use more energy and forage less efficiency than unexposed bees, although further studies that directly measure energetic cost are required to confirm this. Given the robust and growing body of evidence demonstrating negative sublethal effects of neonicotinoids on bees, sublethal assessments on non-Apis bees should be made mandatory within the regulatory process.  ¬© 2021 The Author(s).

Bees encounter many pesticides in agricultural landscapes4‚Äì9 and the effects of this landscape exposure on colony growth and development of any bee species remains unknown. Here we show that the many pesticides found in bumble bee-collected pollen are associated with reduced colony performance during crop bloom, especially in simplified landscapes with intensive agricultural practices. Our results from 316 Bombus terrestris colonies at 106 agricultural sites across eight European countries confirm that the regulatory system fails to sufficiently prevent pesticide-related impacts on non-target organisms, even for a eusocial pollinator species in which colony size may buffer against such impacts10,11.

The oral feeding of single imidacloprid sub-lethal doses (1.0¬†ng, 0.5¬†ng, or 0.1¬†ng) under laboratory conditions significantly impaired associative learning during the 2nd and 3rd conditioning trials compared to control bees (0¬†ng).

364,JOUR,The Utility of a Bumble Bee (Bombus spp. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) Brood Test for Evaluating the Effects of Pesticides,"['Krueger, AJ', 'Early, TM', 'Ripperger, RJ', 'Cabrera, AR', 'Schmehl, DR']",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,"Risk assessment for chemicals in the United States relies upon the honey bee (Apis meliffera L. [Hymenoptera: Apidael) as a surrogate for other bee species. There is uncertainty in extrapolating honey bee toxicity data to bumble bees due to differences in life history strategies, food consumption, and nest structure. Here we evaluated the design of a queenless bumble bee microcolony test that could be considered for generating larval toxicity data. Three microcolony studies were conducted with Bombus impatiens to evaluate the effects of exposure to 1) diflubenzuron in pollen, 2) dimethoate in pollen, and 3) dimethoate in sucrose. Immature drone bee emergence, worker survival, pollen, and sucrose utilization were measured throughout the study duration. For dimethoate, a 10-cl chronic adult bumble bee study was also conducted to compare microcolony endpoints to toxicity endpoints on individual adults. Microcolonies exposed to 10 mg diflubenzuron/kg pollen produced fewer adult drones despite no effects on worker survival. Microcolonies treated with dimethoate at >= 3 mg a.i./kg pollen and >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg sucrose solution produced fewer drones. Exposure to dimethoate in the 10-d chronic adult study resulted in direct mortality to the adult workers at >= 0.1 mg a.i./kg diet. Results from the 10-d study suggest direct effects of dimethoate on workers in the microcolony will alter provisioning of diet to the brood, resulting in lower drone production in the microcolony. Our data suggest that the microcolony study is only appropriate to assess brood effects to bumble bees for substances with low toxicity to adults, as demonstrated with diflubenzuron.

231,JOUR,Pesticide exposure affects flight dynamics and reduces flight endurance in bumblebees,"['Kenna, D', 'Cooley, H', 'Pretelli, I', 'Rodrigues, AR', 'Gill, SD', 'Gill, RJ']",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"The emergence of agricultural land use change creates a number of challenges that insect pollinators, such as eusocial bees, must overcome. Resultant fragmentation and loss of suitable foraging habitats, combined with pesticide exposure, may increase demands on foraging, specifically the ability to collect or reach sufficient resources under such stress. Understanding effects that pesticides have on flight performance is therefore vital if we are to assess colony success in these changing landscapes. Neonicotinoids are one of the most widely used classes of pesticide across the globe, and exposure to bees has been associated with reduced foraging efficiency and homing ability. One explanation for these effects could be that elements of flight are being affected, but apart from a couple of studies on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), this has scarcely been tested. Here, we used flight mills to investigate how exposure to a field realistic (10 ppb) acute dose of imidacloprid affected flight performance of a wild insect pollinator-the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris audax. Intriguingly, observations showed exposed workers flew at a significantly higher velocity over the first 3/4 km of flight. This apparent hyperactivity, however, may have a cost because exposed workers showed reduced flight distance and duration to around a third of what control workers were capable of achieving. Given that bumblebees are central place foragers, impairment to flight endurance could translate to a decline in potential forage area, decreasing the abundance, diversity, and nutritional quality of available food, while potentially diminishing pollination service capabilities.",2019/05//,2019,10.1002/ece3.5143,9,10,5637,5650,,,,2045-7758,WOS:000470923500008,,0,,0,501

When applied as seed treatment, residues of the tested molecules in the pollen and nectar samples were present below quantifiable levels (< LOQ).

Further, the foraging activity of the bees did not appear to be impacted when neonicotinoids were applied as seed treatment. Contrarily, foliar application of the neonicotinoides significantly reduced the foraging activity between 1 and 3 days after application.

300,JOUR,Solitary bee behaviour and pollination service delivery is differentially impacted by neonicotinoid and pyrethroid insecticides,"[""O'Reilly, A.D."", 'Stanley, D.A.']",Science of the Total Environment,"Solitary bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and their decline poses a risk to the sustained provision of the services they provide. Although evidence suggests that exposure to insecticides can affect bees, most pesticide research and risk assessment has focussed on social bees and mortality while solitary species are understudied. The ability to forage is critical for solitary bee reproduction, also in how they deliver pollination services, and we know little about how insecticides can impact these behaviours. We exposed solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to field realistic levels of two widely used insecticides with differing modes of action (lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid) and acetamiprid (neonicotinoid)), in a semi-field setting over multiple rounds of exposure. We then tested impacts on bee behaviour and pollination in apples, an important global insect-pollinated crop. Pollination by insecticide-treated bees reduced apple production by up to 86 % depending on the compound and the number of exposures, but the underlying mechanism behind this remains unclear and should be investigated further. Other measurements of pollination services including number of seeds per apple and stigma pollen deposition showed no relationship with pesticide treatment. Bee foraging behaviour was also affected by treatment where both insecticides appear to induce an excitatory effect which was constant for acetamiprid and eventually ceased for lambda-cyhalothrin after multiple exposures. This suggests that both neonicotinoid and non‚Äëneonicotinoid insecticides can potentially affect behaviour and pollination services of solitary bees depending on how often they are exposed, which is particularly important given the changing usage patterns of these compound classes based on regulations around their use. This highlights the importance of moving insecticide risk assessment towards more field realistic scenarios and including sublethal effects on solitary and social bees, in addition to considering repeated exposures of bees to pesticides as is realistic in the field. ¬© 2023 The Authors",2023///,2023,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164399,894,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163847851&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2023.164399&partnerID=40&md5=0111f5e09432e383a1d7717e1469527d,Scopus,"['acetamiprid', 'Acetamiprid', 'aerosol', 'animal', 'animal behavior', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'apple', 'Article', 'bee', 'bee pollination', 'Bees', 'Cell proliferation', 'controlled study', 'crop yield', 'Crop yield', 'Crops', 'cyhalothrin', 'exposure', 'female', 'field study', 'foraging behavior', 'Foraging behaviour', 'Foraging behaviours', 'Fruits', 'harvest', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'Lambda-cyhalothrin', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoid insecticides', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nonhuman', 'Osmia bicorni', 'Osmia bicornis', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'pistil stigma', 'plant seed', 'Plants (botany)', 'pollen', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollution exposure', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'Pyrethroid insecticide', 'pyrethroid pesticide', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk perception', 'Risks assessments', 'Service delivery', 'sublethal effect']",,,,0,,0,508

Beekeepers send samples to analytical laboratories, but sometimes no residues can be detected. Temperature and sun light could influence the decrease of pesticides in bee samples and thereby residues left for analysis. Moreover, samples are usually sent via normal postal services without cooling. We investigated the temporal dynamics of whole-body residues of imidacloprid in live or dead honeybees following a single-meal dietary exposure of 41 ng/bee under various environmental conditions, such as freezing, exposure to UV light or transfer of individuals through the mail system. Immobile, ""dead"" looking honeybees recovered from paralysis after 48 hours. The decrease of residues in living but paralysed bees was stopped by freezing (= killing). UV light significantly reduced residues, but the mode of transport did not affect residue levels. Group feeding increased the variance of residues, which is relevant for acute oral toxicity tests. In conclusion, elapsed time after poisoning is key for detection of neonicotinoids. Freezing before mailing significantly reduced the decrease of imidacloprid residues and may increase the accuracy of laboratory analysis for pesticides.",2017/07/24/,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-06259-z,7,,2045-2322,WOS:000406260800001,,,,,,,0,,0,509

After oral application, acetamiprid and deltamethrin at the concentrations used were not able to impair learning sessions. When the retention tests were performed 1 h, 6 h, and 24 h after learning, we found a significant difference between bees after learning sessions when drugs were applied 24 h before learning. Deltamethrin-treated bees were found to be more sensitive at 10 ng/bee and 100 ng/bee doses compared to acetamiprid-treated bees, only with amounts of 100 ng/bee and at 6 h and 24 h delays. When insecticides were applied during learning sessions, none of the tested insecticides was able to impair learning performance at 10 ng/bee or 100 ng/bee but retention performance was altered 24 h after learning sessions. Acetamiprid was the only one to impair retrieval at 10 ng/bee, whereas at 100 ng/bee an impairment of retrieval was found with both insecticides. The present results therefore suggest that acetamiprid and deltamethrin are able to impair retrieval performance in the honey bee Apis mellifera. ¬© 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2015///,2015,10.3390/insects6040805,6,4,805,814,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84942882498&doi=10.3390%2finsects6040805&partnerID=40&md5=2edfb2f135894865d9027f2abf06c659,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,510

Imidacloprid,"['Stephenson, G.L.', 'Solomon, K.R.']",Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health - Part B: Critical Reviews,"A quantitative weight of evidence (QWoE) methodology was used to assess higher-tier studies on the effects of imidacloprid (IMI) on honeybees. Assessment endpoints were population size and viability of commercially managed bees and quantity of hive products. A colony-level no-observed-adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) of 25¬†¬µg IMI/kg syrup, equivalent to an oral no-observed-adverse-effect-dose of 7.3 ng/bee/d for all responses, was measured. The overall weight of evidence indicates that there is minimal risk to honeybees from exposure to IMI from its use as a seed treatment. Exposures via dusts from currently used seed coatings present a de minimis risk to honeybees when the route of exposure is via uptake in plants that are a source of pollen or nectar for honeybees. There were few higher-tier observational (ecoepidemiological) studies conducted with IMI. Considering all lines of evidence, the quality of the studies included in this analysis was variable, but the results of the studies were consistent and point to the same conclusion‚Äìthat IMI had no adverse effects on viability of the honeybee colony. Thus, the overall conclusion is that IMI, as currently used as a seed treatment and with good agricultural practices, does not present a significant risk to honeybees at the level of the colony. ¬© 2017 Taylor & Francis.",2017///,2017,10.1080/10937404.2017.1388564,20,06-Jul,330,345,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034013703&doi=10.1080%2f10937404.2017.1388564&partnerID=40&md5=32379bdbbf363f1eaa1b4a74bc753bb0,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,511

(Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). We also made progress toward developing reliable methodology for testing pesticides on wild bees for use in pesticide registration by using field and laboratory experiments. Bee larvae were exposed to control, low (3 or 6 ppb), intermediate (30 ppb), or high (300 ppb) doses of either imidacloprid or clothianidin in pollen. Field experiments on both bee species involved injecting the pollen provisions with the corresponding pesticide. Only O. lignaria was used for the laboratory experiments, which entailed both injecting the bee's own pollen provisions and replacing the pollen provision with a preblended pollen mixture containing imidacloprid. Larval development, emergence, weight, and mortality were monitored and analyzed. There were no lethal effects found for either imidacloprid or clothianidin on O. lignaria and M. rotundata. Minor sublethal effects were detected on larval development for O. lignaria, with greater developmental time at the intermediate (30 ppb) and high doses (300 ppb) of imidacloprid. No similar sublethal effects were found with clothianidin on M. rotundata. We were successful in creating methodology for pesticide testing on O. lignaria and M. rotundata; however, these methods can be improved upon to create a more robust test. We also identified several parameters and developmental stages for observing sublethal effects. The detection of sublethal effects demonstrates the importance of testing new pesticides on wild pollinators before registration. ¬© 2008 Entomological Society of America.",2008///,2008,10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[784:LASEOI]2.0.CO;2,101,3,784,796,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-46849085579&doi=10.1603%2f0022-0493%282008%29101%5b784%3aLASEOI%5d2.0.CO%3b2&partnerID=40&md5=94eb7020b56ec3609982e73b629a54fe,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,512
310,JOUR,COLONY IMPACT OF PESTICIDE-INDUCED SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON HONEYBEE WORKERS: A SIMULATION STUDY USING BEEHAVE,"['Thorbek, P', 'Campbell, PJ', 'Thompson, HM']",ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,"Research on neonicotinoids and honeybees have changed focus from direct mortality to sublethal effects. In the present study, a published honeybee model, BEEHAVE, is used to compare induced colony level impact of pesticides including direct mortality, poor brood care, disorientation, and increased handling time in oilseed rape and sunflower crops. Actual effects on individual bees will depend on exposure concentrations, but in the present study large effects were enforced. In oilseed rape, poor brood care had the largest colony impact, because it created a bottleneck for spring build-up of the workforce, and colony impact for all effect types peaked 1 mo after exposure ceased. In sunflower, the later exposure changed the response so colony impact peaked during exposure, and the bottleneck was honey store build-up. In all scenarios, good forage mitigated effects substantially. It is concluded that field studies should continue at least 1 mo after exposure to ensure detection of ecologically relevant sublethal effects. The results indicated that even if a sublethal effect is difficult to detect in the field, subsequent ecologically relevant colony level impacts would be clear if studies are continued for 1 mo after exposure. Guidance for regulatory studies recommends extended observation periods, and published field studies already use extended observation periods, so it is concluded that current methods are adequate for detecting ecologically relevant sublethal effects. Although published laboratory and semifield studies conducted under controlled exposure conditions suggest that sublethal effects may occur, published field studies with neonicotinoid seed treatments, naturally foraging bees, and extended observation periods do not report colony-level effects, suggesting that in these studies no ecologically relevant sublethal effects occurred.

359,JOUR,The Neonicotinoid Insecticide Imidacloprid Disrupts Bumblebee Foraging Rhythms and Sleep,"['Tasman, K', 'Rands, SA', 'Hodge, JJL']",ISCIENCE,"Neonicotinoids have been implicated in the large declines observed in insects such as bumblebees, an important group of pollinators. Neonicotinoids are agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are found throughout the insect central nervous system and are the main mediators of synaptic neurotransmission. These receptors are important for the function of the insect central clock and circadian rhythms. The clock allows pollinators to coincide their activity with the availability of floral resources and favorable flight temperatures, as well as impact learning, navigation, and communication. Here we show that exposure to the field-relevant concentration of 10 mu g/L imidacloprid caused a reduction in bumblebee foraging activity, locomotion, and foraging rhythmicity. Foragers showed an increase in day-time sleep and an increase in the proportion of activity occurring at night. This could reduce foraging and pollination opportunities, reducing the ability of the colony to grow and reproduce, endangering bee populations and crop yields.",2020/12/18/,2020,10.1016/j.isci.2020.101827,23,12,,,,,"['Ecology', 'Animal Physiology', 'Behavioral Neuroscience', 'Biological Sciences', 'Zoology']",2589-0042,WOS:000600670000070,,0,,0,514
326,JOUR,Effect of repeated intakes of a neonicotinoid insecticide on the foraging behaviours of Apis mellifera in field trials,"['Girolami, V', 'Toffolo, EP', 'Mazzon, L', 'Zampieri, F', 'Lentola, A', 'Giorio, C', 'Tapparo, A']",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,"Evaluating the effects of neonicotinoids on forager bees in conditions as near as possible to those in nature presents a considerable challenge. Tackling this challenge is, however, necessary to establish their negative side effects on these pollinators. For instance, it is still under debate the mechanism by which bees seem to recognize low-level contaminations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar and pollen of the flowers they visit and limit collection to protect themselves and their hive from a possible intoxication. In this study, we propose an experimental system that involves the use of foragers in free flight foraging repeatedly on artificial feeders containing a sucrose solution contaminated with clothianidin, as well as foragers feeding at adjacent control feeders, allowing us to observe changes in their foraging activity. The progressive disappearance of foragers from the contaminated feeders became increasingly clear and rapid with the increase in clothianidin concentration. The lowest concentration at which we observed an effect was around 10 mu g/L, which corresponds to the maximum residual concentration (10 ng/g) observed in pollen and nectar of flowers close to open fields sown with seeds coated with insecticides. At the highest concentrations tested (80 mu g/L), there was an almost total abandonment of the feeders. The estimated quantity of contaminated sucrose solution collected by foragers showed an almost linear relationship inversely proportional to clothianidin concentration, whilst the estimated quantity of insecticide collected by a forager increased and then stabilised at the highest concentrations tested of 40 and 80 mu g/L. Irregular mortality was not observed in front of the hives, furthermore, foragers did not show evident memory of the position of the treated units in the trials on the 2 consecutive days. The decrease in foraging activity in the presence of a few mu g/L of insecticide in the sucrose solution appears to limit the introduction of elevated amounts of toxic substances into the hives, which would have serious consequences for the young bees and the brood. At the same time, in the absence of an alternative energy source, even reduced feeding of the hive can compromise colony health.",2023/01//,2023,10.1007/s11356-022-22977-y,30,5,12257,12268,,,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'foraging behavior', 'neonicotinoid pesticide', 'sublethal effect', 'clothianidin', 'honeybee', 'sucrose', 'toxicity', 'concentration (composition)', 'nectar', 'mortality', 'Plant Nectar', 'Sucrose', 'fly', 'alternative energy', 'Clothianidin toxicity', 'dietary intake', 'Foraging activity', 'Honeybee behaviour', 'phytotoxicity', 'Sub-lethal doses']",0944-1344,WOS:000854721900010,,0,,0,515

However, colony-level studies on the effects of neonicotinoids in field studies are limited, primarily due to their complexity and the resources required. This paper reports the combined results of two large-scale colony-feeding studies, each with 6 weeks of continuous dosing of 12 colonies per treatment (24 control) to 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50 or 100 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose solution. Exposure continued beyond dosing with residues present in stored nectar and bee-bread. The studies were conducted in an area with limited alternative forage and colonies were required to forage for pollen and additional nectar The studies provide colony-level endpoints: significant effects (reductions in bees, brood) were observed after exposure to the two highest dose rates, colony loss occurred at the highest dose rate, but colonies were able to recover (2‚Äì3 brood cycles after the end of dosing) after dosing with 50 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. No significant colony-level effects were observed at lower dose rates. The data reported here support the conclusions of previous colony-level crop-based field studies with thiamethoxam, in which residues in pollen and nectar were an order of magnitude below the colony-level NOEC of 37.5 ng thiamethoxam/g sucrose. The feeding study data are also compared to the outcomes of regulatory Tier 1 risk assessments conducted using guidance provided by the USA, Canada, Brazil and the EU regulatory authorities.

Honey bee colonies fed sublethal concentrations of imidicloprid (0, 5, 20 and 100 ppb) over 6 weeks in field trials at a desert site (Arizona), a site near intensive agriculture (Arkansas) and a site with little nearby agriculture but abundant natural forage (Mississippi) were monitored with respect to colony metrics, such as adult bee and brood population sizes, as well as pesticide residues. Hive weight and internal hive temperature were monitored continuously over two trials in Arizona. Colonies fed 100 ppb imidacloprid in Arizona had significantly lower adult bee populations, brood surface areas and average frame weights, and reduced temperature control, compared to colonies in one or more of the other treatment groups, and consumption rates of those colonies were lower compared to other colonies in Arizona and Arkansas, although no differences in capped brood or average frame weight were observed among treatments in Arkansas.

184,JOUR,"A common neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, alters honey bee activity, motor functions, and movement to light","['Tosi, S.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Scientific Reports,"Honey bees provide key ecosystem services. To pollinate and to sustain the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour. However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity (velocity: +109%; time moving: +44%) shortly after exposure (30 min), and impaired motor functions (falls: +83%; time top: -43%; time bottom: +93%; abnormal behaviours: +138%; inability to ascend: +280%) over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend. TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure.

Tetragonisca angustula and Scaptotrigona xanthotricha are species that have been used since ancient times for beekeeping. Currently these and other species have been exposed to agronomic practices, among which the use of synthetic pesticides used for crop protection stands out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of the insecticides thiamethoxam and fipronil, which are used in agriculture in several countries in the tropical and subtropical belt in order to establish the risk that these products represent to the survival of these two species. The oral and topical LD50 was obtained by Probit analysis. Comparisons with the LD50s of other stingless bees and Apis mellifera were realized. Although further studies are required to calculate the real risk of the two compounds, the results showed an evident susceptibility of both species. We concluded that it is essential to use tools and practices that reduce the risk, and perform toxicological evaluations of new and existing pesticides on stingless bees. ¬© 2017, Universidad Nacional de Colombia1.

The pollination carried out by the honeybee Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is crucial in increasing the productivity of the melon (Cucumis melo L.). The main objective of this study was to assess if insecticides applied in the cultivation of cantaloupe melon exhibit significant levels of toxicity toward A. mellifera. We tested the toxicity of azadirachtin, pyriproxyfen, chlorantraniliprole, and imidacloprid, which are commonly sprayed to manage melon pests such as the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), the pickleworm Diaphania nitidalis (Stoll) and the melonworm Diaphania hyalinata (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). Three treatments were carried out, 0.0x, 0.1x and 1.0x the concentration recommended by the manufacturer for the control of those pests. Repellency tests, analysis of mortality through contact and ingestion, and flight tests were performed. The insecticide imidacloprid caused mortality rates above 90% in all tested exposure pathways, displaying high residue persistence on plants. Although not causing significant mortality in the ingestion test, pyriproxyfen caused significant mortality after exposure through contact, and change in flight ability. Azadirachtin caused mortality in the ingestion test and impaired the flight ability of bees, while chlorantraniliprole only impaired the flight ability. Moreover, bees were not repelled by these insecticides, suggesting that they may collect contaminated food in the field while foraging. Altogether, ecofriendly, alternative pest control options should be developed, as well as the adoption of more selective insecticides, in order to reduce the non-target effects on honeybees and guarantee their pollination services.",2020/01//,2020,10.1007/s10646-019-02145-8,29,1,97,107,,,,0963-9292,WOS:000515814700009,,0,,0,524

Recent studies have shown that extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMFs) affect many aspects of insect behaviour and cognition which raises the potential that ELF EMFs could interact with other environmental stressors such as neonicotinoid insecticides to have even greater impact on the decline of flying insects. Here we analysed the effects of individual and combined exposure of the honey bee to 50 Hz EMFs and sublethal exposure to clothianidin, in a tethered flight assay and an olfactory appetitive learning assay. Clothianidin was significantly toxic to bees and exposure to field-realistic levels (2.00 ng/bee) led to 25% mortality. Exposure to ELF EMFs alone led to a significant increase in wingbeat frequency at levels above 100 ¬µT. Prior exposure to clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on wingbeat frequency. Exposure to EMFs alone reduced learning of a proboscis extension reflex (PER). Prior exposure to low doses of clothianidin attenuated the effects of EMFs on PER. These results indicate no evidence of synergy between clothianidin and ELF EMFs as environmental stressors but suggest the potential for EMFs to affect the same susceptible fraction of the bee population that have been affected by clothianidin. Results lay the foundation to further explore the interactions of ELF EMFs with other environmental stressors and consider the key factors that may make bees susceptible to ELF EMFs. ¬© 2021",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100051,4,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118699937&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100051&partnerID=40&md5=3fa0e1bc03406e457bd1eb4d83cd26b7,Scopus,"['Apis mellifera', 'Associative learning', 'Clothianidin', 'EMF', 'Flight']",,0,,0,526

Farmland bees can be widely exposed to dietary residues of neurotoxic neonicotinoid insecticides that appear in the nectar and pollen of treated bee-attractive crops, which may harm them. An earlier study shows that dietary neonicotinoids cause complex alterations to thermoregulation in honey bees, but their effect on the thermogenic capabilities of individual bumble bees has been untested previously. We therefore conducted laboratory trials involving separate dietary exposures of bumble bees to two neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and we measured their effects on the thoracic temperatures of bees during recovery from chilling. Specifically, we used thermal imaging to measure the rates of rewarming by individual bees after chill-induced torpor and to quantify their equilibrated thoracic temperatures post-recovery. We found that both toxicants caused dose-dependent decreases in the rates of rewarming and in the equilibrated thoracic temperatures. As previously found in honey bees, the dose‚Äìresponse relationship for imidacloprid exhibited a biphasic hormesis with low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, for which we propose a mechanism. Our present study is among the first to detect ecologically relevant effects on bees in neonicotinoid exposures involving dietary concentrations below 5 ppb. If the effects on thoracic temperatures that we observed over a short period were sustained, they could have ecologically significant impacts on farmland bumble bees. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2018///,2018,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2017.11.006,104,,33,39,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034786241&doi=10.1016%2fj.jinsphys.2017.11.006&partnerID=40&md5=2ec6d258462a734f7451789afb4ab060,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,527
465,JOUR,Quantifying the impact of pesticides on learning and memory in bees,"['Siviter, H.', 'Koricheva, J.', 'Brown, M.J.F.', 'Leadbeater, E.']",Journal of Applied Ecology,"Most insecticides are insect neurotoxins. Evidence is emerging that sublethal doses of these neurotoxins are affecting the learning and memory of both wild and managed bee colonies, exacerbating the negative effects of pesticide exposure and reducing individual foraging efficiency. Variation in methodologies and interpretation of results across studies has precluded the quantitative evaluation of these impacts that is needed to make recommendations for policy change. It is not clear whether robust effects occur under acute exposure regimes (often argued to be more field-realistic than the chronic regimes upon which many studies are based), for field-realistic dosages, and for pesticides other than neonicotinoids. Here we use meta-analysis to examine the impact of pesticides on bee performance in proboscis extension-based learning assays, the paradigm most commonly used to assess learning and memory in bees. We draw together 104 (learning) and 167 (memory) estimated effect sizes across a diverse range of studies. We detected significant negative effects of pesticides on learning and memory (i) at field realistic dosages, (ii) under both chronic and acute application, and (iii) for both neonicotinoid and non-neonicotinoid pesticides groups. We also expose key gaps in the literature that include a critical lack of studies on non-Apis bees, on larval exposure (potentially one of the major exposure routes), and on performance in alternative learning paradigms. Policy implications. Procedures for the registration of new pesticides within EU member states now typically require assessment of risks to pollinators if potential target crops are attractive to bees. However, our results provide robust quantitative evidence for subtle, sublethal effects, the consequences of which are unlikely to be detected within small-scale prelicensing laboratory or field trials, but can be critical when pesticides are used at a landscape scale. Our findings highlight the need for long-term postlicensing environmental safety monitoring as a requirement within licensing policy for plant protection products. ¬© 2018 The Authors.

Recent studies however have suggested that exposure to systemic neonicotinoid insecticides in flowering crops has sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing queen production. The mechanism behind reduced nest performance, however, remains unclear. Here we use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to test whether exposure to a low, field realistic dose (0.7 ppb in sugar water and 6 ppb in pollen) of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, reduces worker foraging efficiency. Whilst the nectar foraging efficiency of bees treated with imidacloprid was not significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought back pollen less often than control bees (40 % of trips vs 63 % trips, respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back 31 % less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on foraging ability of bumblebee workers when collecting pollen, and we suggest that this provides a causal mechanism behind reduced queen production in imidacloprid exposed colonies.",2014/04//,2014,10.1007/s10646-014-1189-7,23,3,317,323,,,,0963-9292,WOS:000333127600001,,0,,0,530

In the pesticide registration procedure, the honey bee represents one of the non-target model species for which the risk posed by pesticides must be assessed on the basis of the hazard quotient (HQ). The HQ is defined as the ratio between environmental exposure and toxicity. For the honey bee, the HQ calculation is not consistent because it corresponds to the ratio between the pesticide field rate (in mass of pesticide/ha) and LD50 (in mass of pesticide/bee). Thus, in contrast to all other species, the HQ can only be interpreted empirically because it corresponds to a number of bees/ha. This type of HQ calculation is due to the difficulty in transforming pesticide field rates into doses to which bees are exposed. In this study, we used a pragmatic approach to determine the apparent exposure surface area of honey bees submitted to pesticide treatments by spraying with a Pottertype tower. The doses received by the bees were quantified by very efficient chemical analyses, which enabled us to determine an apparent surface area of 1.05 cm2/bee. The apparent surface area was used to calculate the exposure levels of bees submitted to pesticide sprays and then to revisit the HQ ratios with a calculation mode similar to that used for all other living species. X-tomography was used to assess the physical surface area of a bee, which was 3.27 cm2/bee, and showed that the apparent exposure surface was not overestimated. The control experiments showed that the toxicity induced by doses calculated with the exposure surface area was similar to that induced by treatments according to the European testing procedure. This new approach to measure risk is more accurate and could become a tool to aid the decision-making process in the risk assessment of pesticides. ¬© 2014 Poquet et al.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0113728,9,11,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84913553440&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0113728&partnerID=40&md5=0bd734a30f96cf5929cbd058f27dc9d0,Scopus,,,0,,0,532

In the present study, we assessed how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid affects bumblebees' foraging behavior after exposure to four different treatment levels, including field-realistic concentrations (0 [control], 1, 10, and 100 mu g/L), through sucrose solution over 9 days. We observed the behavior of several free-flying bumblebees simultaneously foraging on artificial flowers in a flight arena to register the bees' complex behavior postexposure. To conduct a detailed assessment of how insecticides affect bumblebee locomotor behavior, we used video cameras and analyzed the recordings using computer vision. We found that imidacloprid impaired learning and locomotor activity level when the bumblebees foraged on artificial flowers. We also found that imidacloprid exposure reduced sucrose solution intake and storage. By using automated analyses of video recordings of bumblebee behavior, we identified sublethal effects of imidacloprid exposure at field-realistic doses.

Increasing the chain length of alkyl substituents (from methyl to n-butyl) on an amino nitrogen atom of acetamiprid homologue and 3-pyridylmethylamine reduces the potency as inhibitors of [H-3]alpha-BGT binding, whereas it confers the enhanced potency as inhibitors of [H-3]PCP binding in the insect nAChR.

429,JOUR,Extrapolating Acute Contact Bee Sensitivity to Insecticides Based on Body Weight Using a Phylogenetically Informed Interspecies Scaling Framework,"['Pamminger, T.']",Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry,"Plant protection products, including insecticides, are important for global food production but can have adverse effects on nontarget organisms including bees. Historically, research investigating such effects has focused mainly on the honeybee (Apis mellifera), whereas less information is available for non-Apis bees. Consequently, a comprehensive hazard (sensitivity) assessment for the majority of bees is lacking, which in turn hinders accurate risk characterization and consequently bee protection. Interspecies sensitivity extrapolation based on body weight might be a way to improve the situation, but in the past such approaches often ignored the phylogenetic background of the species used, which in turn potentially reduces the robustness of such results. Published acute contact sensitivity data (median lethal dose per bee) of bees to insecticides, their body weight, and their phylogenetic background were used to build interspecies scaling models to predict bee sensitivity based on their weight. The results indicate that 1) bee body weight is a predictor of acute contact bee sensitivity to a range of insecticides, and 2) phylogeny (nonindependence of data points) needs to be considered in cross-species analysis, although it does not always confound the observed effects.

Bumble bees are important wild pollinators that are widely exposed to dietary neonicotinoids by foraging in agricultural environments. In the laboratory, we tested the effect of a pulsed exposure (14 days 'on dose' followed by 14 days 'off dose') to a common neonicotinoid, imidacloprid, on the amount of brood (number of eggs and larvae) produced by Bombus terrestris L. bumble bees in small, standardised experimental colonies (a queen and four adult workers). During the initial 'on dose' period we observed a dose-dependent repression of brood production in colonies, with productivity decreasing as dosage increased up to 98 Œºg kg-1 dietary imidacloprid. During the following 'off dose' period, colonies showed a dose-dependent recuperation such that total brood production during the 28-day pulsed exposure was not correlated with imidacloprid up to 98 Œºg kg-1. Our findings raise further concern about the threat to wild bumble bees from neonicotinoids, but they also indicate some resilience to a pulsed exposure, such as that arising from the transient bloom of a treated mass-flowering crop. ¬© 2013 Laycock, Cresswell.",2013///,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0079872,8,11,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891847565&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0079872&partnerID=40&md5=c95398840c4316e40856693282a9ed17,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,539

Fakulteit van de Landbouwkundige en Toegepaste Biologische Wetenschappen),"Spinosad is a novel insect control agent derived by fermentation of the Actinomycete bacterium, Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Spinosad controls many caterpillar pests in vines, pome fruit and vegetables (including tomatoes and peppers), thrips in tomatoes, peppers and ornamental cultivation and dipterous leafminers in vegetables and ornamentals. Application rates vary between 25 to 100 g of active substance per hectare (g as/ha) and 4.8 to 36 g of active substance per hectolitre (g as/hL) depending on the crop and target pest. It is important that plant protection products are authorized for use only in ways that do not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to honeybees. For this purpose testing was performed to enable the safety of spinosad to be evaluated. The effects of spinosad to honeybees have been extensively researched. Testing has been performed under a variety of conditions in a range of countries globally. Studies to determine the acute toxicity of spinosad under laboratory conditions were conducted to generate LD50 or LC50 values for oral and contact routes of administration. These demonstrated that spinosad was highly toxic to worker honeybees under worst case laboratory conditions and that the oral route of exposure provided the greater risk. Residue tests conducted under laboratory, semi-field and field conditions on worker honeybees foraging on treated foliage indicated that dry product residues were harmless. Therefore the effects seen in the laboratory acute toxicity tests did not translate to a more realistic exposure scenario indicating that safe use patterns for the product can be developed. Semi-field cage studies have also demonstrated that spinosad was safe to bees when applied to flowering crops during periods of bee activity. The majority of studies conducted have indicated that spinosad does not adversely affect honeybee behaviour, brood or queen. It can be concluded that spinosad when used according to the approved product label recommendations, would be safe to foraging worker bees, queen and brood.

In social bees, which are crucial pollination service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin, provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over 5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field methods and should be considered when considering improvements to current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

Laboratory-reared O. lignaria females were exposed to three concentrations of imidacloprid (0, 50, 390 and 780 ppb), in wet (30% moisture) soil for 20 min and released in large flight cages, where impacts on nesting activity and nest cell production were evaluated. Mortality was tested in another experiment using exposure at the same concentrations with two differing soil moisture levels (20% and 40%). Nesting activity was reduced by 42% for females exposed at 390 ppb and by 66% for females exposed at 780 ppb. Females treated at 780 ppb produced 40% fewer nest cells per day. Sex ratios of F1 generation were skewed toward male in the 50 ppb treatment group with 50% fewer females. The number of cells and pre-pupae per nest, as well as the weight of pre-pupal cocoons did not vary among exposure levels. There were no mortality effects at 20% soil moisture for any level of imidacloprid, but at 40%, mortality of females was >50% at all levels of imidacloprid. These results suggest that acute exposure to imidacloprid residue in soil can have negative impacts on soil-interacting bees, and the effects may be relative to the degree of soil moisture. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128572,264,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092346997&doi=10.1016%2fj.chemosphere.2020.128572&partnerID=40&md5=b205993dc73bd03a5529c9a81a609452,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Hymenoptera', 'imidacloprid', 'Insecticides', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'Article', 'controlled study', 'female', 'nonhuman', 'Pesticides', 'Apoidea', 'survival', 'survival rate', 'concentration (composition)', 'Imidacloprids', 'comparative study', 'mortality', 'laboratory method', 'male', 'Male', 'Female', 'nesting', 'Osmia', 'Osmia lignaria', 'Nesting Behavior', 'nesting behavior', 'pupa', 'Soil', 'orchard', 'Megachilidae', 'soil moisture', 'Cavity-nesting', 'Cell production', 'cocoon', 'Exposure level', 'Moisture level', 'sex ratio', 'soil', 'Soil drench applications', 'Soil moisture', 'Solitary bees', 'Treated soils', 'Treatment group']",,,,0,,0,542

Honeybees use their sense of smell to identify the queen and nestmates, to signal danger and to distinguish flowers during foraging. Few behavioural studies to date have examined how neonicotinoid pesticides affect the ability of bees to distinguish odours. Here, we used a differential learning task to test how neonicotinoid exposure affects learning, memory and olfactory perception in foraging-age honeybees. Bees fed with thiamethoxam could not perform differential learning and could not distinguish odours during short- and long-term memory tests. Our data indicate that thiamethoxam directly impacts the cognitive processes involved in working memory required during differential olfactory learning. Using a combination of behavioural assays, we also identified that thiamethoxam has a direct impact on the olfactory perception of similar odours. Honeybees fed with other neonicotinoids (clothianidin, imidacloprid, dinotefuran) performed the differential learning task, but at a slower rate than the control. These bees could also distinguish the odours. Our data are the first to show that neonicotinoids have compound specific effects on the ability of bees to perform a complex olfactory learning task. Deficits in decision making caused by thiamethoxam exposure could mean that this is more harmful than other neonicotinoids, leading to inefficient foraging and a reduced ability to identify nestmates. ¬© 2020.

In this study we determined the acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate, widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera.

[Malvales: Malvalceae]) in a shopping mall parking lot in Wilsonville, Oregon provoked the largest documented pesticide kill of bumble bees in North America. Based on geographic information systems and population genetic analysis, we estimate that between 45,830 and 107,470 bumble bees originating from between 289 and 596 colonies were killed during this event. Dinotefuran is a neonicotinoid that is highly effective in exterminating and/or harming target pest insects and non-target beneficial insects. Analysis to detect the concentration of pesticides in flowers that received foliar application revealed that the minimum reported dinotefuran concentration of a sampled T. cordata flower was 7.4 ppm, or in excess of 737% above the LC50 of the beneficial pollinator, the honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Furthermore, sampled Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoskowski, 1862 [Hymenoptera: Apidae]) were found to have an average dinotefuran concentration of 0.92 ppm at the time of death, which exceeds the maximum LC50 of A. mellifera (0.884 ppm). Our study underscores the lethal impact of the neonicotinoid pesticide dinotefuran on pollinating insect populations in a suburban environment. To our knowledge, the documentation and impact of pesticide kills on wild populations of beneficial insects has not been widely reported in the scientific literature.

In the present study, the joint toxicity of acetamiprid and co-applied pesticide adjuvants (N-methyl pyrrolidone [NMP], Silwet L-77, and Triton X-100) to honeybees was determined both in the laboratory and under semifield conditions. The 3 pesticide adjuvants caused no significant acute toxicity to honeybees by themselves; however, in the laboratory tests, they significantly increased the acute contact toxicity of acetamiprid to honeybees. For the semifield tests, in the T2 group (treatment with 5% acetamiprid soluble concentrate [SL] containing 10% Silwet L-77), the mortality of honeybees was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the blank control on the fourth day after application (DAA + 4), that of the T1 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% NMP) on DAA + 4 and DAA + 7 (seventh day after application), and that of the T3 group (5% acetamiprid SL containing 10% Triton X-100) on DAA + 4. Furthermore, the flight intensity in the T2 group on DAA + 7, the colony intensity on DAA + 28 (28th day after application), and the mean areas covered by pupae on DAA + 15 (15th day after application) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of the blank control. Therefore, pesticide adjuvants may be important factors in increasing the toxicity of neonicotinoids to honeybees.

One cognitive trait, spatial working memory, may be important in avoiding previously-visited flowers and other spatial tasks such as navigation. To test this, we investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial working memory in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, using an adaptation of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules. We then exposed bees to either a high sub-lethal positive control thiamethoxam dose (2.5 ng(-1) bee), or one of two low doses (0.377 or 0.091 ng(-1)) based on estimated field-realistic exposure. The high dose caused bees to make more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the task than unexposed bees. For the low doses, the negative effects were smaller but statistically significant, and dependent on bee size. The spatial working memory impairment shown here has the potential to harm bees exposed to thiamethoxam, through possible impacts on foraging efficiency or homing.",2016/12/13/,2016,10.1038/srep38957,6,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000389629000001,,0,,0,549
202,JOUR,"Chronic exposure of imidacloprid and clothianidin reduce queen survival, foraging, and nectar storing in colonies of bombus impatiens","['Scholer, J.', 'Krischik, V.']",PLoS ONE,"In an 11-week greenhouse study, caged queenright colonies of Bombus impatiens Cresson, were fed treatments of 0 (0 ppb actual residue I, imidacloprid; C, clothianidin), 10 (14 I, 9 C), 20 (16 I, 17C), 50 (71 I, 39 C) and 100 (127 I, 76 C) ppb imidacloprid or clothianidin in sugar syrup (50%). These treatments overlapped the residue levels found in pollen and nectar of many crops and landscape plants, which have higher residue levels than seed-treated crops (less than 10 ppb, corn, canola and sunflower). At 6 weeks, queen mortality was significantly higher in 50 ppb and 100 ppb and by 11 weeks in 20 ppb-100 ppb neonicotinyl-treated colonies. The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37% I, 56% C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears that only a few workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest. The majority of the workers sat immobilized for weeks on the floor of the flight box without moving to fed at sugar syrup feeders. Neonicotinyl residues were lower in wax pots in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided. At 10 (14) ppb I and 50 (39) ppb C, fewer males were produced by the workers, but queens continued to invest in queen production which was similar among treatments. Feeding on imidacloprid and clothianidin can cause changes in behavior (reduced worker movement, consumption, wax pot production, and nectar storage) that result in detrimental effects on colonies (queen survival and colony weight). Wild bumblebees depending on foraging workers can be negatively impacted by chronic neonicotinyl exposure at 20 ppb. ¬© 2014 Krischik, Scholer.",2014///,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0091573,9,3,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84898612237&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0091573&partnerID=40&md5=aa07d353ee46623650c4b9da794e2aa3,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,550

Currently, broad gaps exist in our knowledge as to how horticultural management practices, such as irrigation level, might influence bee reproduction, particularly for solitary bees. Despite the extensive use of ornamental plants by bees, especially little is known about how irrigation level may interact with insecticides, like water-soluble neonicotinoids, to influence floral rewards and bee reproduction. We designed a two-factor field cage experiment in which we reared Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) on containerized ornamental plants grown under two different irrigation levels and imidacloprid treatments (30% label rate dosage of a nursery formulation or an untreated control). Lower irrigation was associated with modest decreases in nectar volume and floral abundance in untreated plants, whereas irrigation did not affect plants treated with imidacloprid. Furthermore, higher irrigation decreased the amount of imidacloprid entering nectar. Imidacloprid application strongly reduced bee foraging activity and reproduction, and higher irrigation did not offset any negative effects on bees. Our study emphasizes the impact of a nursery neonicotinoid formulation on solitary bee foraging and reproduction, while highlighting interactions between irrigation level and neonicotinoid application in containerized plants themselves.  ¬© 2021 The Authors.",2021///,2021,10.1098/rspb.2021.1287,288,1955,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112616684&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2021.1287&partnerID=40&md5=ccbc25face125461bdf205b87eb2db2f,Scopus,"['animal', 'Animals', 'bee', 'Bees', 'Gardens', 'Hymenoptera', 'imidacloprid', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'irrigation', 'land use', 'Megachile rotundata', 'Megachilidae', 'native species', 'nectar', 'neonicotinoid', 'neonicotinoids', 'Neonicotinoids', 'Nitro Compounds', 'nitro derivative', 'nursery ground', 'ornamental species', 'pesticide', 'Pesticides', 'Phacelia tanacetifolia', 'Plant Nectar', 'plant-pollinator interaction', 'soil moisture']",,0,,0,552

Pesticide exposure may cause behavioural changes that interfere with these processes, with consequences for colony persistence and delivery of pollination services. 2. We investigated the impact of chronic exposure (5-43 days) to field-realistic levels of a neonicotinoid insecticide (2.4 pph thiamethoxam) on foraging ability, horning success and colony size using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in free-flying bumblebee colonies. 3. Individual foragers from pesticide-exposed colonies carried out longer foraging bouts than untreated controls (68 vs. 55 min). Pesticide-exposed bees also brought back pollen less frequently than controls indicating reduced foraging performance. 4. A higher proportion of bees from pesticide-exposed colonies returned when released 1 km from their nests; this is potentially related to increased orientation experience during longer foraging bouts. We measured no impact of pesticide exposure on homing ability for bees released from 2 km, or when data were analysed overall. 5. Despite a trend for control colonies to produce more new workers earlier, we found no overall impacts of pesticide exposure on whole colony size. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study shows that field-realistic neonicotinoid exposure can have impacts on both foraging ability and homing success of bumblebees, with implications for the success of bumblebee colonies in agricultural landscapes and their ability to deliver crucial pollination services.

439,JOUR,The neonicotinoid imidacloprid impairs honey bee aversive learning of simulated predation,"['Zhang, E.', 'Nieh, J.C.']",Journal of Experimental Biology,"Neonicotinoid insecticides can impair bee learning and memory - cognitive features that play a key role in colony fitness because they facilitate foraging. For example, the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid reduces honey bee olfactory learning. However, no studies have previously determined whether imidacloprid can impair aversive associative learning, although such learning should enhance bee survival by allowing bees to avoid dangerous foraging sites. To mimic attempted predation of foragers, we developed an electro-mechanical predator that consistently attacked foragers with a pinching bite at a fixed force and elicited aversive olfactory learning in a sting extension response (SER) assay. We show that chronic exposure to a sublethal concentration of imidacloprid (25.6 Œºg l-1=20.8 ppb) over 4 days (mean of 1.5 Œºg per bee day-1), significantly impaired aversive short-Term learning and memory retention. Imidacloprid treatment reduced short-Term learning by 87% and memory retention by 85% in comparison with control bees. Imidacloprid therefore impairs the ability of honey bees to associate a naturalistic predation stimulus - biting - with floral odor compounds. Such learning should enhance bee survival, suggesting that xenobiotics could alter more complex ecological interactions such as predator-prey relationships. ¬© 2015.

It was believed that the processing factor (PF) is an important variable to determine the final pesticide residue during royal jelly formation and the actual risk to honeybee larva. Hence, a QuEChERS method to determine acetamiprid contents in honeybee samples was established in this study. Then, the PFs for acetamiprid in beebread fermentation, honey brewing, and royal jelly formation were determined to be 0.85, 0.76, and 0.16, respectively. The PF for royal jelly formation was 0.04 when acetamiprid was detected in beebread alone, and it was 0.12 when acetamiprid was only detected in honey. Finally, the predicted exposure concentration of acetamiprid in royal jelly was calculated to be 2.05¬†¬µg/kg using the PF without significant difference with the 90th percentile value (3.64¬†¬µg/kg) in the actual sample. However, the value was 16.62¬†¬µg/kg without considering the PF.

420,JOUR,Foraging bumblebees acquire a preference for neonicotinoid-treated food with prolonged exposure,"['Arce, AN', 'Rodrigues, AR', 'Yu, JJ', 'Colgan, TJ', 'Wurm, Y', 'Gill, RJ']",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,"Social bees represent an important group of pollinating insects that can be exposed to potentially harmful pesticides when foraging on treated or contaminated flowering plants. To investigate if such exposure is detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time. For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii) have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources within the foraging landscape.",2018/08/29/,2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0655,285,1885,,,,,,0962-8452,WOS:000443163500004,,0,,0,559

We examined one neonicotinoid pesticide, imidacloprid, for its effects on the foraging behavior of free-flying honey bees (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) visiting artificial blue and white flowers. Imidacloprid doses, ranging from 1/5 to 1/50 of the reported LD50, were fed to bees orally. The study consisted of three experimental parts performed sequentially without interruption. In Part 1, both flower colors contained a 4 ŒºL 1¬†M sucrose solution reward. Part 2 offered bees 4 ŒºL of 1.5¬†M sucrose solution in blue flowers and a 4 ŒºL 0.5¬†M sucrose solution reward in white flowers. In Part 3 we reversed the sugar solution rewards, while keeping the flower color consistent. Each experiment began 30¬†min after administration of the pesticide. We recorded the percentage of experimental bees that returned to forage after treatment. We also recorded the visitation rate, number of flowers visited, and floral reward choices of the bees that foraged after treatment. The forager return rate declined linearly with increasing imidacloprid dose. The number of foraging trips by returning bees was also affected adversely. However, flower fidelity was not affected by imidacloprid dose. Foragers visited both blue and white flowers extensively in Part 1, and showed greater fidelity for the flower color offering the higher sugar solution reward in Parts 2 and 3. Although larger samples sizes are needed, our study suggests that imidacloprid may not affect the ability to select the higher nectar reward when rewards were reversed. We observed acute, mild effects on foraging by honey bees, so mild that storage of imidacloprid tainted-honey is very plausible and likely to be found in honey bee colonies. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2015///,2015,10.1007/s10646-015-1537-2,24,9,2017,2025,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84948105114&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-015-1537-2&partnerID=40&md5=9c6be28f653d8d0189fb78790d94c8dd,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,560

A wide variety of insecticides are used to manage D. citri populations within citrus groves in Florida. However, in areas shared by citrus growers and beekeepers the use of insecticides may increase the risks of Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) loss and contaminated honey. The objective of this research was to determine the environmental toxicity of insecticides, spanning five different modes of action used to control D. citri, to A. mellifera. The insecticides investigated were imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, spinetoram and diflubenzuron. In laboratory experiments, LD50 values were determined and ranged from 0.10 to 0.53 ng/mu l for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate and spinetoram. LD50 values for diflubenzuron were > 1000 ng/mu l. Also, a hazard quotient was determined and ranged from 1130.43 to 10893.27 for imidacloprid, fenpropathrin, dimethoate, and spinetoram. This quotient was < 0.447 for diflubenzuron. In field experiments, residual activity of fenpropathrin and dimethoate applied to citrus caused significant mortality of A. mellifera 3 and 7 days after application. Spinetoram and imidacloprid were moderately toxic to A. mellifera at the recommended rates for D. citri. Diflubenzuron was not toxic to A. mellifera in the field as compared with untreated control plots. Phenoloxidase (PO) activity of A. mellifera was higher than in untreated controls when A. mellifera were exposed to 14 days old residues.

Little information has been published about ecotoxicity to O. excavata, especially the larvae. To clarify the risk of commonly used insecticides with different modes of action to the larvae of O. excavata, six insecticides (clothianidin, acetamiprid, sulfoxaflor, lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorfenapyr and abamectin) were selected for evaluation of their acute lethal toxicity and sublethal effects. Clothianidin and abamectin were the two most toxic insecticides to the larvae of O. excavata with LD50 values of 0.007 (0.006‚Äì0.008) and 0.0004 (0.0003‚Äì0.0006) Œºg active ingredient (a.i.) bee‚àí1, respectively. And their ecological risks were high according to the hazard quotient values (HQ > 2500). Sulfoxaflor was identified as the only safe insecticide for O. excavata (HQ < 50) under field conditions. Sublethal toxicity tests showed that larval weight was significantly decreased by ingesting food treated with clothianidin, lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin (less than the maximum field registered concentrations on fruit trees) due to interference with consumption per larva and reduction of the efficiency of conversion of ingested food. Additionally, above three insecticides significantly prolonged larval developmental duration before cocooning and decreased eclosion rate. Overall, there results suggested that clothianidin and abamectin should not be applied, especially during the flowering phase, the application frequency of lambda-cyhalothrin should be minimized for the purpose of conserving O. excavata. Our results provided important evidences for selecting appropriate insecticides for use in fruit orchards. ¬© 2021 The Authors",2021///,2021,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.112015,212,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100555144&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2021.112015&partnerID=40&md5=dcc8fe91b0358488cc94cc49750eeb1b,Scopus,"['abamectin', 'acetamiprid', 'animal', 'animal experiment', 'Animals', 'Article', 'bee', 'Bees', 'chemical pollutant', 'chlorfenapyr', 'clothianidin', 'cocoon', 'comparative study', 'controlled study', 'crop', 'Crops, Agricultural', 'cyhalothrin', 'dose response', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'drug effect', 'ecotoxicity', 'Ecotoxicity', 'ecotoxicology', 'Ecotoxicology', 'Excavata', 'flowering', 'fruit', 'growth, development and aging', 'guanidine derivative', 'Guanidines', 'hazard assessment', 'Hymenoptera', 'insecticide', 'Insecticides', 'larva', 'Larva', 'larval development', 'LD50', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Megachilidae', 'neonicotinoid', 'Neonicotinoids', 'nitrile', 'Nitriles', 'nonhuman', 'orchard', 'Osmia', 'Osmia excavata', 'pollination', 'Pollination', 'pollinator', 'Pyrethrins', 'pyrethroid', 'pyridine derivative', 'Pyridines', 'risk assessment', 'Risk assessment', 'Risk Assessment', 'sublethal effect', 'Sublethal effects', 'sulfoxaflor', 'Sulfur Compounds', 'sulfur derivative', 'taxonomy', 'thiazole derivative', 'Thiazoles', 'toxicity testing', 'unclassified drug']",,0,,0,564

While bees in the field get rarely exposed to lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids applied as seed coating, sublethal levels found in pollen and nectar may affect bee population development. We assessed a realistic and a worst-case scenario of clothianidin exposure to mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) by conducting a small-scale field and semi-field experiment at sites planted with winter oilseed rape. Flight activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were assessed at three locations. We also analysed clothianidin residues in bee-collected pollen and nectar. We detected clothianidin at low concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7¬†¬µg/kg for bumblebees and 4.7¬†¬µg/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10¬†g clothianidin/kg seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population development. However, an impairment of flower visitation under a worst-case scenario may have implications for pollination services and crop production. ¬© 2019, Bundesamt f√ºr Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).",2019///,2019,10.1007/s00003-019-01225-5,14,3,223,238,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067641041&doi=10.1007%2fs00003-019-01225-5&partnerID=40&md5=b9cc247f444efdff1e2c1173f8187c7a,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,565
541,JOUR,Neonicotinoid contamination in conservation areas affects bees more sharply than beetles,"['Tetlie, J.', 'Harmon-Threatt, A.']",Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution,"The neurotoxic insecticide class of neonicotinoids has become one of the most widely used groups of pesticides globally. Their long half-lives and high water solubility increase their potential to linger and affect numerous organisms long after application. A prominent concern associated with residual contamination is the negative impact that neonicotinoids can have on beneficial arthropods such as bees and certain groups of beetles. Many studies have looked at the effects neonicotinoids have on arthropod communities in lab settings; however, comparatively few studies have looked at these groups in neonicotinoid-contaminated restored prairie habitats. These habitats are often restored from or located near agriculture and are almost ubiquitously contaminated with neonicotinoids. Our one-year manipulated field study compared native bee nesting rates and beetle community assemblages between paired clothianidin-contaminated and non-contaminated restored prairie plots. Native bee nesting probability and nesting abundance increased by 46% and 172%, respectively, in sites contaminated with clothianidin. Conversely, we observed no significant differences in beetle family assemblages, abundance, or richness between clothianidin-contaminated and control sites. These results suggest that neonicotinoid contamination of natural habitats can have numerous environmental consequences for arthropods and that these effects are not always consistent between taxa. Understanding how neonicotinoid contamination affects beneficial groups such as bees and arthropod community assemblages is crucial for characterizing the risks these chemicals pose to ecologically imperative taxa.

457,JOUR,Neonicotinoids and Optimal Foraging Theory,"['Pyke, G.H.']",Environmental Advances,"Determination of how neonicotinoid ingestion affects the foraging behaviour of flower-visiting animals, and using Optimal Foraging Theory to assess the nature and extent of consequent changes to foraging efficiency, provide a novel approach for understanding how neonic ingestion affects the cognitive abilities of these animals, and their ultimate reproductive success. Neonicotinoids (neonics for short) are used worldwide as insecticides to protect agricultural crops, but may be ingested by non-target flower-visiting animals, such as bees, with negative impacts on their cognitive abilities and consequent adverse effects on their foraging behaviour, reproduction and pollination services. Optimal Foraging Theory may help to understand such effects as it hypothesises that nectar-feeding animals, including bees, will adopt foraging behaviour that maximises net rate of energy intake. Simple models of foraging movements exist but require further development to be useful in this regard. Observed movement patterns could then be compared with predicted patterns, derived from such models, and compared between neonicotinoid-affected and control individuals, with the expectation that control individuals will forage optimally, while neonicotinoid-affected individuals will not exhibit such behaviour and will exhibit reduced foraging success. However, there has been little attempt to develop and test predictions for cognitive foragers, like bees, that are moving between flowers or flower clusters, potentially limiting our ability to manage neonic-use to control agricultural pests. Addressing this gap should lead to enhanced knowledge and understanding of the impacts of neonics on non-target animals, along with other possible flow-on environmental impacts, including possible reductions in pollinator abundance and hence the harvest yields of crops requiring pollination, and could lead to refinements in policy and procedure for future use of neonics to control agricultural pests. The same issues apply to other insecticides and to interactions amongst insecticides. ¬© 2021 The Author",2022///,2022,10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100161,7,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121931806&doi=10.1016%2fj.envadv.2021.100161&partnerID=40&md5=ba9a047b9539b133e3a93207275811fc,Scopus,"['Neonicotinoids', 'Bee cognition', 'Foraging movements', 'Optimal Foraging Theory']",,,,0,,0,568
460,JOUR,Chronic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide alters the interactions between bumblebees and wild plants,"['Stanley, DA', 'Raine, NE']",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,"Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to feed both themselves and provision their colonies. Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However, little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate flowers. We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens) in an outdoor flight arena. We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide. There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers, and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus on their first visit. Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary for ecosystem functioning.",2016/07//,2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12644,30,7,1132,1139,,,,0269-8463,WOS:000379978100012,,0,,0,569

Here we tested whether the relative effect of wildflower plantings on pollinator diversity and counts were modified by proportion of nearby agricultural land cover and pesticide exposure in 24 conserved grasslands in Iowa, USA. Compared with general grassland conservation practices, wildflower plantings led to only a 5% increase in pollinator diversity and no change in counts regardless of the proportion of cropland agriculture within a 1 km radius. Pollinator diversity increased earlier in the growing season and with per cent flower cover. Unexpectedly, neither insecticide nor total pesticide concentrations on above-ground passive samplers were related to pollinator diversity. However, pollinator community composition was most strongly related to date of sampling, total pesticide concentration, and forb or flower cover. Our results indicate very little difference in pollinator diversity between grassland conservation practices with and without wildflower plantings. Given the relatively high economic costs of wildflower plantings, our research provides initial evidence that investment in general grassland conservation may efficiently conserve pollinator diversity in temperate regions of intensive cropland agriculture.",2023/11/22/,2023,10.1098/rsos.231093,10,11,2054-5703,WOS:001108052900006,,,,,,,0,,0,570

Because insecticides are used during bloom to manage insect pests, bumble bees may be at risk of exposure. We therefore assessed the susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life span, and reproduction. The highest concentration of deltamethrin (17 mg a.i./L) reduced feeding. Workers treated with deltamethrin had shortened life spans and produced fewer males. Flubendiamide (2000 mg a.i./L) and spinetoram (0.8 mg a.i./L) caused no sublethal effects.

Results indicate that spinosad use in cotton does not exceed the most conservative Tier I levels of concern (LOC) values for groundwater, mammals and birds or acute risk to aquatic organisms. Use of very conservative Tier I screening methods resulted in exceeding LOC values for chronic exposure for some aquatic organisms, thus prompting further refinement. When the exposure prediction was refined using less conservative, Tier II mechanistic environmental fate transport models to predict offsite transport and environmental concentrations, chronic risk was not predicted for these species.

One possible cause of bee declines is pesticide use. Bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid pesticide, have been shown to be less efficient foragers and collect less pollen on foraging trips than unexposed bees. We investigated whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) chronically exposed to imidacloprid at field-realistic levels of 2.6 and 10 ppb showed learning deficits that could affect foraging. Bumblebees were tested for their ability to associate flower colour with reward value in a simulated foraging environment. Bumblebees completed 10 foraging trips in which they collected sucrose solution from artificial flowers that varied in sucrose concentration. The reward quality of each artificial flower was predicted by corolla colour. Unexposed bumblebees acquired a preference for feeding on the most rewarding flower colour on the second foraging trip, while bumblebees exposed at 2.6 and 10 ppb did not until their third and fifth trip, respectively. The delay in preference acquisition in exposed bumblebees may be due to reduced flower sampling and shorter foraging trips. These results show that bumblebees exposed to imidacloprid are slow to learn the reward value of flowers and this may explain previously observed foraging inefficiencies associated with pesticide exposure. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018///,2018,10.1007/s10646-017-1883-3,27,2,175,187,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038868257&doi=10.1007%2fs10646-017-1883-3&partnerID=40&md5=bd9b6a48434b0c0aee93fbb0f6728b07,Scopus,,,,,0,,0,574

We did not find evidence that consuming 0.0515¬†ng imidacloprid affected the sonication length, sonication frequency, or flight frequency for bees that sonicated after consuming imidacloprid; we were unable to test changes in these variables for bees that consumed 0.515 or 5.15¬†ng because we did not observe enough of these bees sonicating after treatment. We performed Cox proportional hazard regression to determine whether consuming imidacloprid affected the probability of engaging in further sonication behavior on S. lycopersicum and found that bumblebees who consumed 0.515 or 5.15¬†ng of imidacloprid were significantly less likely to sonicate after treatment than bees who consumed no imidacloprid. At the end of the experiment, we classified bees as dead or alive; our data suggest a trend of increasing mortality with higher doses of imidacloprid.

The effects of these five insecticides on the abundance and diversity indices of major pollinators were also analyzed. The results showed that the toxicity of 0.3% azadirachtin was relatively high for O. loti and A. pisum with LC50 values of 1.093 mg/L and 2.864 mg/L, respectively. Both 70% imidacloprid and 4% abamectin¬∑acetamiprid showed high efficacy against both O. loti and A. pisum, with the highest efficacy exceeding 85.00%. However these two pesticides posed a greater threat to pollinators, while 0.3% azadirachtin was less threatening to them. It was recommended to use 0.3% azadirachtin (diluted 1 000 times) for pest control in alfalfa during the flowering stage.Meanwhile, 70% imidacloprid (diluted 1 000 times) and 4% abamectin¬∑acetamiprid (diluted 1 000 times) can be used alternatively during the non-flowering stage for pest control. ¬© 2023 Editorial Board of Journal of Plant Protection.

573,JOUR,Bee sensitivity derived from acute contact tests biased by standardised protocols?,"Baas, J.; Knautz, T.; Barme, A.; Sekine, T.; Jaklofsky, M.; Belgers, D.; Jansen, N.; Boerwinkel, M.-C.; Roessink, I.",Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety,"In an acute contact test with bees the compound of interest is dissolved in a carrier solvent (frequently acetone) and then a droplet of the solution is placed on the dorsal thorax of the bee. The volume of the droplet is standardised to 1 ¬µL for honeybees and to 2 ¬µL for bumblebees. In practice the same droplet volume is used for bees with very different sizes. In this research the effect of the droplet volume was evaluated with acute contact tests with dimethoate for the alfalfa leafcutter bee, the red mason bee, the honeybee and the bumblebee. The results were analysed with a ToxicoKinetic ToxicoDynamic (TKTD) model to separate kinetic from dynamic effects. This allows to compare the sensitivity of the bee based on the effect threshold and not on the time, species and test dependent LD50s. The analysis of the test results indicates that the magnitude of the response of the bees increased with increasing droplet size. The results also showed that the manifestation of effects over time is slower for the red mason bee and the bumblebee compared to the honeybee and the alfalfa leafcutter bee. This implies that the result of a 2 day test with a fixed dosing volume results in different response for a bumblebee compared to the alfalfa leafcutter bee, not because of different sensitivities of the bees involved but due to the difference of relative dosed surface ratio. So comparing the sensitivity of bee species, based on standardised tests is biased and amplifies the sensitivity for the smaller bee species. ¬© 2024 The Authors",2024,2024,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.117062,285,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204093571&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2024.117062&partnerID=40&md5=b1f836d123f4699f1ed12e39a28b193e,,"acetone; acute contact test; Acute contact test; acute toxicity; alfalfa; anesthetic agent; animal; Animals; Apis mellifera; Article; bee; bee sensitivity; Bee sensitivity; Bee testing; BeeGUTS; Bees; body size; Bombus terrestris; breeding; bumblebee; clinical protocol; cocoon; crop protection; dimethoate; Dimethoate; droplet; droplet size; drug effect; female; hatching; honeybee; incubation time; insecticide; Insecticides; LD50; Lethal Dose 50; male; Megachile rotundata; Megachilidae; nonhuman; Osmia bicornis; physical phenomena; physiology; procedures; relative humidity; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; solvent; species difference; Species Specificity; stochastic model; surface area; toxicity testing; Toxicity Tests, Acute; triton x 100; wetting agent",,0,,0,579

373,JOUR,Hazards of imidacloprid seed coating to Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) when applied to sunflower,"['Tasei, JN', 'Ripault, G', 'Rivault, E']",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,"Seed coating treatments of sunflower by the systemic insecticide imidacloprid was suspected of affecting honey bees and bumblebees. The hypothesis raised was whether imidacloprid could migrate into nectar and pollen, then modify Rower attractiveness, homing behavior, and colony development. Our greenhouse and field experiments with Bombus terrestris L. were aimed at the following: the behavior of workers foraging on treated and control plants blooming in a greenhouse, the homing rate of colonies placed for 9 d in a treated field compared with colonies in a control field, and the development of these 20 colonies under laboratory conditions when removed from the fields. In the greenhouse, workers visited blooming heads of treated and control plants at the same rate and the mean duration of their visits was similar. In field colonies, analysis of pollen in hairs and pellets of workers showed that in both fields 98% of nectar foragers visited exclusively sunflowers, whereas only 25% of pollen gatherers collected sunflower pollen. After 9 d, in the control and treated field, 23 and 33% of the marked foragers, respectively, did not return to hives. In both fields, workers significantly drifted from the center to the sides of colony rows. During the 26-d period under field and laboratory conditions, the population increase rate of the 20 colonies was 3.3 and 3.0 workers/ d in hives of the control and treated field, respectively. This difference was not significant. New queens were produced in eight colonies in either field. The mean number of new queens per hive was 17 and 24 in the control and treated field, respectively. Their mating rate was the same. It was concluded that applying imidacloprid at the registered dose, as a seed coating of sunflowers cultivated in greenhouse or in field, did not significantly affect the foraging and homing behavior of B. terrestris and its colony development.",2001/06//,2001,10.1603/0022-0493-94.3.623,94,3,623,627,,,,0022-0493,WOS:000169234700004,,0,,0,581

Abrasion of the seed coating generates insecticide-laden planter dust that disperses through the landscape during corn planting and has resulted in many ‚Äúbee-kill‚Äù incidents in North America and Europe. We investigated the linkage between corn planting and honey bee colony success in a region dominated by corn agriculture. Over 3 yr we consistently observed an increased presence of corn seed treatment insecticides in bee-collected pollen and elevated worker bee mortality during corn planting. Residues of seed treatment neonicotinoids, clothianidin and thiamethoxam, detected in pollen positively correlated with cornfield area surrounding the apiaries. Elevated worker mortality was also observed in experimental colonies fed field-collected pollen containing known concentrations of corn seed treatment insecticides. We monitored colony growth throughout the subsequent year in 2015 and found that colonies exposed to higher insecticide concentrations exhibited slower population growth during the month of corn planting but demonstrated more rapid growth in the month following, though this difference may be related to forage availability. Exposure to seed treatment neonicotinoids during corn planting has clear short-term detrimental effects on honey bee colonies and may affect the viability of beekeeping operations that are dependent on maximizing colony size in the springtime.

To reduce population density of M. alternatus, thiacloprid has been sprayed by aircrafts on pine forests. Thus, we examined the effect of aerial spraying as contact toxicity and thiacloprid residues of pine branches as ingestion toxicity on the mortality of M. alternatus in pine forests in Yangsan, Korea. In addition, the effect of aerial spraying on honey bees, Apis mellifera, was tested in the same locality. Thiacloprid was sprayed once a month from June to August in 2016. To test the effect of thiacloprid, eight M. alternatus and ten honey bees were put into each small mesh cage, which were hung on pine trees in each study plot. Thiacloprid appeared to be effective for reducing longevity of M. alternatus, while mortality and abnormal behaviors were not found for honey bees. In addition, longevity of M. alternatus beetles was declined by thiacloprid residues of pine branches compared to the control group. However, we found that dead pine trees infected by pine wood nematodes in the next year similarly occurred in our study area whether thiacloprid-aerial spraying occurred or not. Consequently, thiacloprid sprayed by aircraft may be an effective control agent for Monochamus beetle adults without negative effect on honey bees, but aerial application to prevent expansion of pine wilt disease should be reassessed. ¬© 2020 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2021///,2021,10.1111/1748-5967.12482,51,2,,,83,89,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092628018&doi=10.1111%2f1748-5967.12482&partnerID=40&md5=0c6befc5cec85b2189292ccf9729ab95,Scopus,"['Non-target insects', 'Pine wilt disease', 'Pine wood nematode', 'Toxicity']",,0,,0,584

The data set comprises reports from a total of 6,655 beekeepers and 129,428 wintered honey bee colonies. Regions surrounding the beekeeping operations were assigned to one of six clusters according to their composition of land use categories by use of a hierarchical cluster analysis, allowing a rough distinction between urban regions, regions predominated by semi-natural areas and pastures, and mainly agricultural environments.

419,JOUR,"A neonicotinoid pesticide impairs foraging, but not learning, in free-flying bumblebees","['Muth, F', 'Leonard, AS']",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"Neonicotinoids are widely-used pesticides implicated in the decline of bees, known to have sub-lethal effects on bees' foraging and colony performance. One proposed mechanism for these negative effects is impairment to bees' ability to learn floral associations. However, the effects of neonicotinoids on learning performance have largely been addressed using a single protocol, where immobilized bees learn an association based on a single sensory modality. We thus have an incomplete understanding of how these pesticides affect bee learning in more naturalistic foraging scenarios. We carried out the first free-foraging study into the effects of acute exposure of a neonicotinoid (imidacloprid) on bumblebees' (Bombus impatiens) ability to learn associations with visual stimuli. We uncovered dose-dependent detrimental effects on motivation to initiate foraging, amount of nectar collected, and initiation of subsequent foraging bouts. However, we did not find any impairment to bees' ability to learn visual associations. While not precluding the possibility that other forms of learning are impaired, our findings suggest that some of the major effects of acute neonicotinoid exposure on foraging performance may be due to motivational and/or sensory impairments. In light of these findings, we discuss more broadly how pesticide effects on pollinator cognition might be studied.",2019/03/18/,2019,10.1038/s41598-019-39701-5,9,,,,,,,2045-2322,WOS:000461418200001,,0,,0,587

After the nuclei are filled with pollen, brood and 1,000 adult bees, foraging bees are trained to visit a feeding station placed at the center of the tunnel, which means a 10 m distance from the entrance of the nuclei. The day-time of the disposal of the sugar solution is to be strictly regarded. When the foragers are well trained to forage a sucrose solution, a contaminated one is offered the following days. Criteria of observation can be (i) the foragers recruitment, (ii) the number of feeding bees and their behaviour at the feeder, (iii) the return flights, (iv) the trophallaxis inside the nucleus. Such a protocol has been put into practice to demonstrate the alteration of the homing flight in bees exposed to sublethal doses of deltamethrin (Vandame et al., 1995).

However, little is known about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often. Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of bumblebees Even without a notable impact on flight performance and learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.",2018/07/25/,2018,10.1098/rspb.2018.0506,285,1883,,,,,,0962-8452,WOS:000439907900005,,0,,0,589

Experiments using the feeding stations (Free-Choice Trials) method with honey solutions containing pesticides revealed that the repellency effect of pesticide formulations is different with some even attractive to honey bees. Experiments were held outdoors close to bee colonies and indoors in a fly-through hall in controlled conditions and commercial pesticides were used.

Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier. Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput identification pipeline. 2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes. 3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent. Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7% detection rate) and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9%). Species lists, biomass frequencies, extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline. 4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification, even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking population trajectories.",2015/09//,2015,10.1111/2041-210X.12416,6,9,2041-210X,WOS:000362916100007,1034,1043,,,,,0,,0,592

In solitary bee species the direct link between each individual female and reproductive success offers the opportunity to evaluate effects on individuals. The present study investigated effects of exposure to winter oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed on reproductive behavior and output of solitary red mason bees (Osmia bicornis) released in 6 pairs of fields over a 2-yr period and confined to tunnels in a single year. After adjustment to the number of females released, there was significantly lower production of cells and cocoons/female in tunnels than in open field conditions. This difference may be because of the lack of alternative forage within the tunnels. Under open field conditions, palynology of the pollen provisions within the nests demonstrated a maximum average of 31% oilseed rape pollen at any site, with Quercus (oak) contributing up to 86% of the pollen. There were no significant effects from exposure to oilseed rape grown from thiamethoxam-treated seed from nest establishment through cell production to emergence under tunnel or field conditions.

As a result, a heterogeneous landscape is created, in which suitable and unsuitable spaces are defined by the absence/presence of pesticides. In this study, we explored how foragers of the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., adapt to such context. We specifically evaluated the effect of GF-120, a spinosad-based fruit fly toxic bait, on the allocation of foragers between food sources under the hypothesis that foragers will move from food sources with GF-120 to food sources without it. We thus carried out three experiments: in experiment 1, a group of foragers was trained to collect honey solution from a feeder; next, this feeder offered a GF-120/honey solution. A minority of foragers continued collecting the GF-120/honey solution. In experiment 2, we trained two groups of foragers from a colony to two food sources equally rewarding. Next, GF-120 was added to one of the food sources. We found that the majority of foragers moved from the GF-120-treated feeder to the feeder without GF-120 and that the minority that continued visiting the GF-120-treated feeder did not collect the GF-120/honey solution. In a third experiment, we wanted to know if foragers in an experimental setup as in experiment 1 would perform waggle dances: none of the foragers that collected GF-120/honey were observed dancing.

The loss of pollinating insects is of particular concern because of the ecological and economic values these species provide. The western bumble bee (Bombus occidentalis) was once common in western North America, but this species has become increasingly rare through much of its range. To understand potential mechanisms driving these declines, we used Bayesian occupancy models to investigate the effects of climate and land cover from 1998 to 2020, pesticide use from 2008 to 2014, and projected expected occupancy under three future scenarios. Using 14,457 surveys across 2.8 million km2 in the western United States, we found strong negative relationships between increasing temperature and drought on occupancy and identified neonicotinoids as the pesticides of greatest negative influence across our study region. The mean predicted occupancy declined by 57% from 1998 to 2020, ranging from 15 to 83% declines across 16 ecoregions. Even under the most optimistic scenario, we found continued declines in nearly half of the ecoregions by the 2050s and mean declines of 93% under the most severe scenario across all ecoregions. This assessment underscores the tenuous future of B. occidentalis and demonstrates the scale of stressors likely contributing to rapid loss of related pollinator species throughout the globe.

To assess the frequency of floral patch use by bees in each hive, we attached electronic tags to bees foraging on white mustard flowers and then recorded the number of tagged bees in each hive a day before insecticide spraying in the adjacent paddy fields. The number of corpses around hive entrances increased within a day after the spraying but varied among hives.

To date, no studies have looked at both outcomes within the same system, meaning win-win solutions for pollinators and yield can only be inferred. Here, we outline a new framework to explore these trade-offs, using red clover (Trifolium pratense) grown for seed production as an example. Specifically, we address how the insecticide thiacloprid affects densities of seed-eating weevils (Protapion spp.), pollination rates, yield, floral resources and colony dynamics of the key pollinator, Bombus terrestris. Thiacloprid did not affect the amount of nectar provided by, or pollinator visitation to, red clover flowers but did reduce weevil density, correlating to increased yield and gross profit. In addition, colonies of B. terrestris significantly increased their weight and reproductive output in landscapes with (compared with without) red clover, regardless of insecticide use. Synthesis and applications. We propose a holistic conceptual framework to explore trade-offs between pollinators, pesticides and yield that we believe to be essential for achieving conservation and agronomic goals. This framework applies to all insecticide-treated mass-flowering crops (MFCs) and can be adapted to include other ecological processes.

Pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, and macrocyclic lactones are among the many agrochemicals toxic to pollinating insects that are used extensively in industrial beef cattle feeding operations throughout the world. Fugitive feedyard particulate matter (PM) transports agrochemicals into the surrounding environs. To determine the impact of agrochemical-laden feedyard particulate matter on bee pollinators, we conducted in situ experiments wherein honeybees and mason bees were placed downwind and upwind of feedyards (N = 40).

(bumble bees), play important roles in the environment as pollinators, and they are directly affected by agronomical practices, such as pesticide spraying or the selection of crop cultivar. Sunflower is an important resource for these pollinators, and its yield is highly dependent on pollination. Six sunflower hybrid cultivars (ES Biba, Gonzalo, Drake, Vellox, NK Neoma, and P63LE10) were used to compare the visitation rates (VR) of pollinators during flowering in three years (2015, 2016, and 2017). From this set, cultivar P63LE10 was selected to evaluate how pesticide treatments (mixture of two insecticide products containing acetamiprid and pirimicarb, respectively, and two fungicide products containing propiconazole plus prochloraz and dimoxystrobin plus boscalid, respectively) affect pollinator visitation. The amount of pesticide residue in sunflower inflorescences was analyzed to determine the content over the duration of the experiments. The sunflower cultivar P63LE10 was significantly the most attractive to both groups of pollinators in 2017. This cultivar was visited by the highest number of honey bees also in the other years. For bumble bees, cultivar P63LE10, along with cultivars NK Neoma and Vellox, had the highest visitation rates in 2015 and 2016.

In these crops, and particularly in covered tomatoes, bumble-bees are used for cross-pollination as an alternative to labour intensive manual techniques. In this study, made on tomatoes grown in separated greenhouse plots in Murcia, Southern Spain, thiamethoxam was applied through drip irrigation at a rate of 200 g ai/ha, and as a split application of the same rate, to evaluate the effects on pollinating bumble bees compared to a foliar application of a toxic standard. The results showed that the toxic foliar standard had a clear effect on the pollination of tomato flowers, declining to zero pollination two weeks after application, whereas both the single and split drip irrigation applications of Actara had no effect on pollination when compared to the control plots. The count of dead adults and larvae did not show any differences between the treatments, whereas the measurement of sugar water consumption was shown to correlate well with pollination. The consumption of sugar water declined in the toxic standard plots by 69% with respect to the control, whilst the decline in lower dose drip irrigation application was only 3%. In regard to hive weight, and number of adults and brood after destructive sampling; there were no statistical differences between the treatments but a negative effect of the foliar treatment was observed. Based on these results we can conclude that a split application of Actara applied in drip irrigation to the soil/substrate has no effect on the bumble-bees used in tomatoes for pollination.",2005///,2005,,70,4,,,569,579,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745798661&partnerID=40&md5=d8a930dc5880ca2de44efbbf6727867e,Scopus,,,0,,0,607

Adding strips of diverse, native, perennial vegetation, through the recently created prairie strips practice of the U.S. Conservation Reserve Program, into annual cropland reduces soil and nutrient loss, and supports more diverse and abundant communities of birds and insects, including native pollinators. It remains unclear if prairie strips can reverse declines in the health and productivity of the exotic honey bee in the U.S.This study determined if prairie strips provide floral resources to honey bees and support colony vigour, in a highly farmed landscape with limited perennial habitat. We hypothesized that honey bee health and productivity would be improved if given access to prairie strips, and this hypothesis was tested in a multi-year, replicated, longitudinal study on commercial, conventional farms committed to corn and soybean production with and without prairie strips. We predicted that prairie strips would have more diverse flowering plants, and colonies located in these strips would be healthier and more productive than colonies kept at farms without purposefully established native vegetation (i.e. control fields).We found that prairie strips had more diverse flowering plants and abundant floral resources than control fields. Colonies kept at fields with prairie strips collected 50% more pollen during the growing season (June-September), had a 24% larger end-of-season worker bee populations, and 20% higher overwinter survival than colonies kept at control fields. Furthermore, colonies kept at prairie strips were 24% heavier when they reached their peak-weight in August, an indicator of honey production.Honey bees collected pollen from flowering plants found in prairie strips, revealing the potential for interactions with wild pollinators. However, this was limited to 50% of the taxa in prairie strips, suggesting honey bees may not deplete all of the food resources simultaneously used by wild pollinators.Synthesis and applications.

In Finland, these statistics are available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the 15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally, the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28% to below 10%. The availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of honey bee colonies were over 30% of the estimated demand. As neither the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services by wild pollinators.",2017/06//,2017,10.1007/s11829-017-9527-3,11,3,1872-8855,WOS:000401742400020,449,461,,,,,0,,0,613

Although certain beekeepers look forward to this foraging opportunity, others suspect a weakening of the bee colonies after they forage on these cover crops, and fear the premature exhaustion of the winter bees. The experiment presented here attempts to evaluate whether late foraging weakens or stimulates the colonies before winter, and whether it has an impact on overwintering. It also aims to determine whether the intermediate crops established directly after a straw cereal coated in neonicotinoids may represent a potential danger for bees. The study shows that foraging on intermediate crops has neither an adverse nor a positive effect on bee populations during flowering and in the following months. Moreover, winter losses are no greater. Chemical analyses show that neonicotinoids may be present in the soil whatever the treatment of the previous crop, and that traces are sometimes found in the pollen brought back to the hive, as well as in the bee bread. These conditions prevent us from comparing two groups with clear different exposures, which would allow us to test the effect of the neonicotinoids in the previous crop on the colonies. ¬© 2016, AMTRA - Association pour la Mise en Valeur des Travaux de la Recherche Agronomique.

As some insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad, spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M. rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon. Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other insecticides we tested may pose a hazard. ¬© 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2012///,2012,10.1007/s10340-011-0391-0,85,1,,,133,140,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84857652083&doi=10.1007%2fs10340-011-0391-0&partnerID=40&md5=94b8475e7369663b7390f2cd5b201bbe,Scopus,,,0,,0,618

Samples of bees were captured on the dispenser, caged and held in the laboratory. Chemical analysis showed some hundred nanograms of insecticide per bee. Nevertheless, caged bees, previously contaminated in flight, died only if kept in conditions of high humidity. After the sowing, an increase in bee mortality in front of the hives was also observed.

However, their proximity to pest control activities in the crop may result in pesticide exposure if pesticides drift into pollinator plantings. To quantify pesticide residues in pollinator plantings, we sampled flowers and soil from pollinator plantings and compared them to samples from unenhanced field margins and crop row middles. At conventionally managed farms, flowers from pollinator plantings had similar exposure profiles to those from unenhanced field margins or crop row middles, with multiple pesticides and high and similar risk quotient (RQ) values (with pollinator planting RQ: 3.9; without pollinator planting RQ: 4.0). Whereas samples from unsprayed sites had significantly lower risk (RQ: 0.005). Soil samples had overall low risk to bees. Additionally, we placed bumble bee colonies ( Bombus impatiens ) in field margins of crop fields with and without pollinator plantings and measured residues in bee -collected pollen. Pesticide exposure was similar in pollen from sites with or without pollinator plantings, and risk was generally high (with pollinator planting RQ: 0.5; without pollinator planting RQ: 1.1) and not significant between the two field types. Risk was lower at sites where there was no pesticide activity (RQ: 0.3), but again there was no significant difference between management types. The insecticide phosmet, which is used on blueberry farms for control of Drosophila suzukii , accounted for the majority of elevated risk. Additionally, analysis of pollen collected by bumble bees found no significant difference in floral species richness between sites with or without pollinator plantings. Our results suggest that pollinator plantings do not reduce pesticide risk and do not increase pollen diversity collected by B. impatiens , further highlighting the need to reduce exposure through enhanced IPM adoption, drift mitigation, and removal of attractive flowering weeds prior to insecticide applications.",2024/04/20/,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171248,922,,0048-9697,WOS:001222172400001,,,,,,,0,,0,620

Our results show that: 1) the GF-120 formulation, when applied at the recommended concentration and mixed with food, does not discourage engaged foragers and, 2) foraging behavior over time is not significantly impaired by the continuous collection of GF-120.",2012/08//,2012,10.1603/EC12047,105,4,0022-0493,WOS:000308074900018,1234,1237,,,,,0,,0,621
620,JOUR,Empirical studies of integrated pest and pollinator management (IPPM) in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.),"['Shankar, U', 'Mukhtar, Y']",JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION,"Experimental studies were conducted at Entomology Farm, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Jammu for two consecutive years (2021-22 and 2022-23) to evaluate the effect of different insecticides against the larval population of Helicoverpa armigera Hubner and the foraging behavior of leafcutter bees in chickpea. The present study recorded six leafcutter bee species within the family Megachilidae and order Hymenoptera (Megachile hera Bingham, M. conjuncta Fabricius, M. lanata Fabricius, Pseudomegachile sp., Osmia sp., and Coelioxys sp.) foraging on chickpea flowers. Four bio-insecticides (B. thuringiensis var. kurstaki, Ha-NPV, NSKE, Neem oil) and three synthetic insecticides (Spinosad, Novaluron, Emamectin benzoate) along with control were evaluated for their efficacy against target pest and pollinators. The foraging of leafcutter bees was significantly higher in bio-insecticide-treated plots than in synthetic-insecticide-treated plots. B. thuringiensis and Ha-NPV were at par in reducing the maximum larval population of H. armigera while causing the least disturbance in the foraging behavior of leafcutter bees. In contrast, synthetic insecticide-treated plots witnessed the least foraging by the pollinators on chickpea flowers.",2024/02//,2024,10.1007/s41348-023-00819-4,131,1,1861-3829,WOS:001098448500001,201,208,,,"['bee', 'Bio-insecticides', 'biopesticide', 'Chickpea', 'disturbance', 'empirical analysis', 'foraging behavior', 'Helicoverpa armigera', 'India', 'insecticide', 'integrated pest management', 'Jammu', 'Jammu and Kashmir', 'Leafcutter bees', 'legume', 'pollinator', 'Synthetic insecticides']",,0,,0,622
531,JOUR,Bee Community of Commercial Potato Fields in Michigan and Bombus impatiens Visitation to Neonicotinoid-Treated Potato Plants,"['Buchanan, AL', 'Gibbs, J', 'Komondy, L', 'Szendrei, Z']",INSECTS,"We conducted a bee survey in neonicotinoid-treated commercial potato fields using bowl and vane traps in the 2016 growing season. Traps were placed outside the fields, at the field edges, and 10 and 30 m into the fields. We collected 756 bees representing 58 species, with Lasioglossum spp. comprising 73% of all captured bees. We found seven Bombus spp., of which B. impatiens was the only known visitor of potato flowers in our region. The majority of the bees (68%) were collected at the field edges and in the field margins. Blue vane traps caught almost four-times as many bees and collected 30% more species compared to bowl traps. Bee communities did not differ across trap locations but they were different among trap types. We tested B. impatiens visitation to neonicotinoid treated and untreated potato flowers in field enclosures. The amount of time bees spent at flowers and the duration of visits were not significantly different between the two treatments. Our results demonstrate that a diverse assemblage of bees is associated with an agroecosystem dominated by potatoes despite the apparent lack of pollinator resources provided by the crop. We found no difference in B. impatiens foraging behavior on neonicotinoid-treated compared to untreated plants.",2017/03//,2017,10.3390/insects8010030,8,1,2075-4450,WOS:000398717700029,,,,,,,0,,0,623
555,JOUR,Agri-environment schemes enhance pollinator richness and abundance but bumblebee reproduction depends on field size,"['Geppert, C', 'Hass, A', 'F√∂ldesi, R', 'Donk√≥, B', 'Akter, A', 'Tscharntke, T', 'Batary, P']",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,"Pollinators have experienced a dramatic decrease world-wide due to agricultural intensification. In many countries, agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced to counteract this current trend. However, until now, the relative importance of each AES for biodiversity and ecosystem services is still little understood and might change depending on landscape context. Complex landscape-experiments are required to fill this knowledge gap, enabling the implementation of sustainable intensification of food production. In our study, we compared the effectiveness of the two most popular AES in Germany, organic farming and flower strips, in supporting pollinators and flower resources. We selected nine landscapes along a gradient of increasing field size, (configurational heterogeneity), each with a triplet of winter wheat fields: one organic, one conventional with flower strip and one conventional without flower strip as a control. We surveyed insect-pollinated plants and pollinators (bumblebees, solitary bees and hoverflies). Additionally, we placed bumblebee colonies in the field edges to monitor their growth (colony weight gain) and reproduction (queen production). Flower strips stood out with the highest abundance and richness of pollinators. In contrast, bumblebee colony growth and plant richness benefited equally from organic and flower strip schemes. At the landscape scale, smaller fields had a positive effect on plant richness and bumblebee reproduction in flower strips. By contrast, bumblebee colonies in organic agriculture benefited most from large fields, as large organic fields provided much more flower resources than the narrow flower strips. Synthesis and applications. Our results showed that both local and landscape management shaped pollinator communities and their reproduction. Overall, organic farming and flower strips appeared to be effective tools to mitigate flower shortage in conventional cereal fields, with organic farming supporting the highest flowering plant cover per field. Flower strips enhanced local pollinator richness most, but increased bumblebee reproduction only when the surrounding landscapes had small fields with long field borders. Therefore, our results reveal that European Union policies need to take into account that the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes depends on the structure of the surrounding landscape.",2020/09//,2020,10.1111/1365-2664.13682,57,9,0021-8901,WOS:000543973300001,1818,1828,,,,,0,,0,624
622,JOUR,Pest management practices impact Helicoverpa armigera infestation and foraging behaviour of pollinators in sunflower,"['Shankar, U.', 'Mukhtar, Y.']",International Journal of Pest Management,"Field experiments for two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) were conducted to record population dynamics of Helicoverpa armigera Hubner and foraging behaviour of pollinators in sunflower before and after undertaking pest management practices. The study disclosed that H. armigera (larvae) crossed ETL (Economic Threshold Level) from 10th SW (Standard Week), warranting application of pest management measures. Many pollinator species were observed foraging on sunflowers during the same time. The least foraging by pollinators was recorded in early morning and late evening hours, depicting avoidance of insecticide application when pollinator foraging activity is maximum. A combination of synthetic and bio-insecticides (Chlorantraniliprole, Bt-kurstaki, Emamectin-benzoate, Spinosad, Lambda-cyhalothrin, Novaluron, and Neem-oil) were tested for their efficacy against H. armigera and impact on foraging behaviour of pollinators. Bio-insecticide-treated plots recorded significantly higher number of foraging pollinators as compared to synthetic-insecticide-treated plots. Of the insecticides used, Chlorantraniliprole showed highest efficacy against H. armigera but recorded lowest foraging activity of pollinators in both the years of study. In contrast, neem-oil and Bt-kurstaki treated plots showed maximum foraging by pollinators while successfully managing H. armigera. ¬© 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023///,2023,10.1080/09670874.2023.2216667,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160956568&doi=10.1080%2f09670874.2023.2216667&partnerID=40&md5=e972c1ac1f5c701fb7d21f267859d720,Scopus,"['foraging behaviour', 'Helicoverpa armigera', 'pest management', 'pollinators', 'Sunflower']",,0,,0,625
